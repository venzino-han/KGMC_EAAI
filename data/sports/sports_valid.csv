Actually, a bit worse because the activation switch is a 3-position slider; a momentary push switch would have been better.

The stun hurts, but not enough to disengage, meaning I'd still be pummeled.

The clip is too small. Why is it even there? Where am I supposed to clip that?
One reviewer likened it to the clip from a pen; I agree.

Holster is a joke. Too small. Cheap materials.

Tip: use a plastic paint scraper (see pic) to assist with the process and protect the surface. It did help to leave the gel sprayed on for a few minutes before lightly scraping. Once residue is removed, wash with hot soapy water, rinse with distilled water, dry with shamus cloth, then apply a little but of 90% isolpropyl alcohol.

22184,6428,3344,"Ive used this little table on three separate occasions now.  Once on an overnight kayak trip, camping in the woods for a week, and making dinner on a fishing trip.

I originally bought it for the fifth edition of an overnight camping trip.  Pulling off on the side of the river and setting up for the night, after four years of cooking on the ground, time for a table.  This table packs up small enough to fit in my kayak, granted it's a predator, which holds a lot. It was sturdy enough to use a 12""  inch lodge cast iron over a tiny little backpacking stove, against the advice of everyone watching, but it worked great.  I didn't dump the whole thing over, much to the surprise of everyone that told me not to do what I was doing.  So the table was a success on the overnight kayak trip. I was sold on its performance after one use, but reviews aren't based on one use!

So the next time I used it, well actually I used it in my garage making amsteel loops for hammock camping, but that's a different story. Anyways I used it for a week camping in the woods. Great to have a table next to my chair for a week to set beverages, sour patch kids and whatever else needs a table under it.  I was already sold on it, and I'm pretty sure more of these will be showing up on camping adventures in my friends' cars after this trip.

The last time I used it was just a few days prior to writing this.  I was out fishing searching around for new streams, it was late in the day and I was ready for dinner. Unfolded this bad boy, cooked up some chow on this thing, ate it, folded it up and was off. Super quick to set up, super quick to take down. Easy peasy.

So that is my experience with it so far.
The pros:  packable
Lightweight
Sturdy-ish
Medium is the perfect height for a camp chair
Stickers will stick to the surface. Hooray!

Cons: it would in no way shape or form stand up to a drunk guy mistaking it for a seat, or falling onto it. This is where sturdy ish comes into play.  I am hard on gear. Like destroying steel belted coolers in a few years hard.  This table will take a little bit of a beating, but not a lot. But that's not what it was designed for. If you want that, get a real table, or don't fall on it drunk...

I usually wait a long time to write a review.  But I feel confident in giving this table five stars after only a few uses. It's a champ, and well worth the money.  It's a total camping game changer, I don't know how I made it this far without one.

1. No need for daily recharge. Watch battery lasts a claimed year at a time.
2. Works with heart rate chest strap.
3. Lightweight and unobtrusive.
4. Has a time and date display.

Cons
1. Low contrast display can be difficult to see at night.
2. Not a fan of the included wristband design. (I recommend buying an aftermarket one.)

If the display on this unit were clearer at night and the wristband were more traditional, this device would be near perfect in my opinion. It is clear enough during the day, but a bit dark after the sun goes down. You can use the one-button interface to make it backlight, so it's not as if it is unusable in low-light, just not as convenient as it could be. Also, I'm not a fan of the clasp that comes with the fitness tracker in the box. For a few dollars extra, I purchased an after-market one that featured a standard watch-style clasp system.

It displays various fitness information on the device - calories burned, steps taken, etc... You scroll through these figures by single clicking the one-button control. I like that the interface is simple and uncluttered. This is just what I was looking for: a fitness tracker that functions primarily as a watch, is not huge and doesn't require daily or weekly recharging. I wear it and forget it most of the time. It's water resistant (I shower with it on) and unobtrusive. Garmin claims that the replaceable watch battery will last as long as a year. We shall see.

The primary reason that I did not choose the vivofit 4 is that you can sync this device with a heart rate monitor for my cycling. It syncs pretty easily with a Garmin HR chest strap and when synced, reads and displays your heart rate. I use the strap for when I'm cycling.

22343,6460,2185,"For $100 it's impressive and worth it. I had been looking at a $50 bike stand and read reviews of plastic clamps breaking, or things slipping. That won't happen with this stand. The legs fold out with a collar that slides down the main tube. The clamp is a quick-release, just like axle skewers. Adjust the tightness and lock it down. The top tube extends upward and again uses a quick-release clamp. Adjustments are easy and secure. The arm at the top is a proper bike stand vise. The lever on the back engages or disengages the teeth which old the arm from rotating. The clamp is easily adjustable and also a quick-release clamp style engagement. It's a proper bike repair tool.

I put my ~30+ lbs full-suspension bike on it and it held the weight just fine. I put a lighter 26"" hardtail on it and then wrenched on the bike for some maintenance. The vise held fine when it was clamped on the top tube with the weight equally balanced front to rear. The vise held fine when it was clamped on the seat tube with more weight toward the front and torquing on the arm. The stand appears well-built and sturdy.

The slight angle of the stand helps get the bike away from the main vertical tube. There is plenty of space to spin the pedals while the bike is on the stand. Any cleaning or adjustments you need to make which requires spinning the drivetrain shouldn't be an issue.

I think the attachable tool tray may be the only ""issue"" with the product. If you attach it then you don't be able to fully collapse the lower support legs. The clamp will hit the tool tray before it gets completely ""closed"". If you remove the tool tray it does fold in half, but there is no hook or clamp or anything to keep it attached to the collapsed stand while not in use. You could buy a velcro strap for this, so it's a minor issue. Just something I could see annoying those who will not leave it permanently open and setup. They may, at some point, misplace or lose the tool tray.",1528761600,5,100 impress worth look 50 bike stand read review plastic clamp break thing slip wont happen stand leg fold collar slide main tube clamp quickreleas like axl skewer adjust tight lock top tube extend upward use quickreleas clamp adjust easi secur arm top proper bike stand vise lever back engag disengag teeth old arm rotat clamp easili adjust also quickreleas clamp style engag proper bike repair tool put 30 lb fullsuspens bike held weight fine put lighter 26 hardtail wrench bike mainten vise held fine clamp top tube weight equal balanc front rear vise held fine clamp seat tube weight toward front torqu arm stand appear wellbuilt sturdi slight angl stand help get bike away main vertic tube plenti space spin pedal bike stand clean adjust need make requir spin drivetrain shouldnt issu think attach tool tray may issu product attach dont abl fulli collaps lower support leg clamp hit tool tray get complet close remov tool

22547,2444,762,"UPDATE:  A few mugs later, I can confirm that using less (i.e. dilute more) makes the coffee more palatable. I may've used a heaping teaspoonful per 6 0z the first time, now I just use a very slightly rounded teaspoonful -- per 6 oz of water.  Again, creamer helps too.  May still buy the year's supply -- survival stash.  Just had an afternoon cup that I reasonably enjoyed... again, a barely rounded tsp per 6oz.  For me, higher concentration is too strong and bitter.

ORIGINAL COMMENTS:
Woof.  I guess it's as good as almost any freeze dried coffee -- except for Starbucks Via and some others you can find that seem to have figured out how to smooth out the bitter edges.  I'll definitely pack this in my camping gear, being light weight and easy to prepare, etc. But my first impression was 'ugh' and 'oof how bitter tasting'.  Adding a little creamer to it helped.  I don't mean to blame the actual coffee formulation... it's probably as good as any of this category.  Kinda wish it didn't have to have that bitter edge.  I'm going to experiment with using less of it -- i.e. more diluted -- should help.  Could be some user error here on my part.  My recommendation would be that first time users do as I did -- buy the small pack first and try it before buying the year's supply. I'll update my findings in time.",1528848000,3,updat mug later confirm use le ie dilut make coffe palat mayv use heap teaspoon per 6 0z first time use slightli round teaspoon per 6 oz water creamer help may still buy year suppli surviv stash afternoon cup reason enjoy bare round tsp per 6oz higher concentr strong bitter origin comment woof guess good almost freez dri coffe except starbuck via other find seem figur smooth bitter edg ill definit pack camp gear light weight easi prepar etc first impress ugh oof bitter tast ad littl creamer help dont mean blame actual coffe formul probabl good categori kinda wish didnt bitter edg im go experi use le ie dilut help could user error part recommend would first time user buy small pack first tri buy year suppli ill updat find time

22554,4345,1272,"Contents of the pack are pretty good and nicely organized. My big issue is with the pack itself, first off, it is not water-proof nor water-resistant. Secondly, it is not standard MOLLE, meaning the MOLLE straps with the buttons on this pack barely reach to click when attached to my ruckpack's MOLLE system. Lastly, one of the straps is shorter than the other.

For $18 it's a pretty good ifak, compared to many on Amazon I guess. Just wish it was water proof or water resistant.

UPDATE: Customer Service was GREAT! They reached out to me before I did and they had sent a replacement pack along with an unneccessary, but immensely appreciated apology to me for the issue I had with the molle straps. The replacement kit could be better or worse than the first one, but I will not be complaining about it since their customer service team was BEYOND exceptional!!!

22637,5961,4397,"I really like this lock. I have not had any of the defective shackle problems that some other reviewers are writing about; I hope that they were able to return the product for a replacement or refund. My shackle slides easily onto the U portion. It also slides on in either direction (the keyhole has to face down, but either end of the U slides easily into either hole). These mini-U-locks are great if you always lock your bike to a modern bike rack, which should be designed so the mini-U lock fits easily. The lock fits around the bike rack, my front wheel, and the frame, then you can use a cable or another lock around the rear wheel. The lock is too small to fit around a parking meter, but I never do that now that my city has bike racks all over the place. These mini-U locks are much lighter weight and easier to carry than the full-sized U-locks. This lock only comes with 2 keys so don't lose them (other brands include 3 or 5 keys with their locks). I would prefer a metal bike mount, but this plastic one hasn't failed on me yet. I do like the way the you lock the lock to the mount so it is very secure (no way for it to fall off when you are riding).

This lock has a Sold Secure silver rating, which is done by a well known independent European bike lock testing program. Some locks have a gold rating, but those are all much more expensive and much heavier than this one. A gold-rated lock is appropriate if you lock your bike for long periods of time on the street in a big city with a known bike theft problem (like San Francisco or New York City).

While this lock works great, I'm giving it only 4 stars because there are only 2 keys and also because the comparable OnGuard Bulldog mini-U-lock costs much less on Amazon (and comes with 5 keys).",1528934400,4,realli like lock defect shackl problem review write hope abl return product replac refund shackl slide easili onto u portion also slide either direct keyhol face either end u slide easili either hole miniulock great alway lock bike modern bike rack design miniu lock fit easili lock fit around bike rack front wheel frame use cabl anoth lock around rear wheel lock small fit around park meter never citi bike rack place miniu lock much lighter weight easier carri fullsiz ulock lock come 2 key dont lose brand includ 3 5 key lock would prefer metal bike mount plastic one hasnt fail yet like way lock lock mount secur way fall ride lock sold secur silver rate done well known independ european bike lock test program lock gold rate much expens much heavier one goldrat lock appropri lock bike long period time street big citi known bike theft problem like san francisco

22774,94,4277,"I took these out today to put them through their paces. Tiger Mt. outside Seattle, awesome PacNW conditions. Lots of jumps, drops, rock gardens, wet roots and general gnar. Perfect proving grounds for pedals as you'll get bounced around, have to dab, get air, etc. I'm usually in the top 25% of riders on any given downhill trails on strava, just to qualify me as a halfway decent shredder.

First impression I have to say that they're not as grippy as I prefer. I was wearing the typical five ten freerider pros which have a grippy sole and I had to readjust quite a bit. It wasn't terrible BTW, they never put me in a dangerous spot and my feet never slipped off or anything like that, but I did have a bunch of times where my feet got a little out of position. Some of this may get better by setting the pins a little higher, or it may just be pin position.

On to the good. They're a nice wide platform. I've got the size L which are great for my size 11's. They're 470 grams, my benchmark DMR Vaults are 420, you notice it if you're holding one in each hand but no difference noticeable once on the bike and pedaling. If you want lighter of course there are the higher end Stamps. They're just about the same size as the Vaults as well which is great. They're pretty affordable at $60-ish a pair currently. If you don't mind the weight they're a pretty good value. I'm not exactly easy on pedals, I already bashed these a few times and they're holding up just fine, even the paint seems decently tough.

22789,6331,4409,"A Handy item for beginners and for a quick refresher for shooters that have not used a .45 in a while (like me).  Last time I fired a .45 was at range qualification in 1987.  So when I picked up a sweet Steel S&W ""E"" .45 1911, I had to dust off some brain cells.  The field guide shows you how to disassemble, clean, lube, and reassemble the .45 to include naming the components.  This will not make you a gun smith, but it is still a handy reference.  Like other people, I ran into issues with the short ball chain (pic 1) that holds the 'dog tags' together.  I know it is supposed to look like a dog tag, but the pages bind up sometimes.  I replaced the ball chain with a key chain loop (pic 2).  If you want, you can leave out the advertising pages.  I left them in, and got the smart wrench and pistol tool.

22869,2169,424,"Great bush knife, this design is a good blend between tactical and bushcraft if I've ever seen it. The blade is not too long, so it can be be wielded close to your body, but it is long enough to accomplish tasks like small batoning. The steel is nothing special, I think 420HC, and that is one of my complaints. At the price point, I would have been happy spending another 25 bucks for S30V or 154CM or something similar. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate 420HC's easy sharpen-ability, but I just personally like something a bit tougher. My only other complaint is the glass breaker/lanyard hole. That sharp point makes locking the knife into it's sheath a literal pain.

Sounds like a lot of bad, but it really isn't. This is a Gerber, made in the USA and should last you a lifetime if you take care of it. I have Gerbers over 10 years old still working great, so I don't worry about staying power. The other thing about these is the price, they are definitely affordable when it comes to bushcraft knives. 100 bucks is pretty standard when getting into these type of American made knives, whether you are looking at Esee, Kabar, Ontario, Buck, etc, so the price is competitive.

Overall, this is a decent knife for the price point. For me, 5 stars could be earned with better steel and removal of that pointy glass breaker.

22891,6591,3807,"These clips didn't fit my pedals; however, I offered them to my friend, who used them for the duration of our seven-day bikepacking trip.

We carried 50+ pounds of weight over roads, trails, and grass, in dry, damp, muddy, rainy, and flooded conditions, and these pedals made all the difference. Through any challenging terrain, the pedals offer an opportunity to use additional muscles to offer your main pedaling muscles a rest. At critical times, the pedals allow you to muster surges of speed to get around people, obstacles, or catch up after slowing down. These really made our trip bearable, and stood up to a huge amount of abuse.

That said, I am now very sold on clipless, and will be using a clipless system in future trips. The pedals were a great introduction to that style of biking, and held their own, but their size and the time overhead of attaching are both burdensome after a few hundred stops. We chose to bind our shoes to pedals instead of buying special clipless shoes to save ourselves volume and weight of a second pair of shoes. Next time, we'll be bringing a pair of clipless shoes and some lightweight crocs for idling :)",1529193600,5,clip didnt fit pedal howev offer friend use durat sevenday bikepack trip carri 50 pound weight road trail grass dri damp muddi raini flood condit pedal made differ challeng terrain pedal offer opportun use addit muscl offer main pedal muscl rest critic time pedal allow muster surg speed get around peopl obstacl catch slow realli made trip bearabl stood huge amount abus said sold clipless use clipless system futur trip pedal great introduct style bike held size time overhead attach burdensom hundr stop chose bind shoe pedal instead buy special clipless shoe save volum weight second pair shoe next time well bring pair clipless shoe lightweight croc idl

23093,3667,4420,"Please stop using recycled chip bags to make these things. I've had too many sleepless nights because someone in a tent 50 feet away is sleeping on a NeoAir XLite. And for you people trying to save 8 ounces, please just carry the extra ounces. Everyone around you at a tent site or shelter will stop spitting in your cook pot if you don't keep them awake all night. If you insist on sleeping on a bag of chips, at least bring a bag of Ruffles, Fritos, or Doritos and share them around a campfire.

Also, the weight of this pad is misleading.  I have a Klymit Static V insulated pad that is 72"" X 23"" X 2.5"" and weighs 24 oz.  They also make a Lite version at 20 oz.  And the Static V is 23"" wide from top to bottom, essentially a rectangle.  Therm-a-rest reduces the weight of this pad in part by reducing the size to 72"" X 20"" X 2.5"".  So you have 1,440 sq inches of sleep surface as opposed to 1,656 sq inches on the Klymit, or about 13% less pad under you.

That may not sound like much.  But, I'm 6'0"" tall and about 215 lbs with a 45"" chest.  I barely fit on the Klymit when I'm on my back.  Trim three inches off the width and my shoulders would extend off the pad and that's annoying.  But it gets worse.  Where the Klymit is a rectangle, this NeoAir XLite has a mummy cut to it that tapers towards the feet.  You probably lose another 140 sq inches or 10% of surface area from the tapering.  Now you're down to a pad that is about 25% smaller and doesn't really fit a large guy very well.  You're pretty much forced to sleep perfectly still on your back or put up with your legs or shoulders constantly falling off the pad.

Next up, the Klymit has an R value of 4.4 vs the NeoAir XLite R value of 3.2.  So the Static V Insulated pad has about 38% more insulating capability.  That may not matter if you won't be in any cold weather and / or you are a warm sleeper.  But here in New England, spring and fall weather can easily dip into the low 30's at night.  The extra insulation may mean the difference between a good night's sleep and just getting by with a fitful night's sleep.

So if the skinny width, the tapered design, the R value, and the noise of someone crinkling a potato chip bag all night sound like good trade offs for 8 ounces, then go for it.  Personally, the size and warmth are not a good fit for me and the noise this thing makes is just embarrassing as well as annoying.",1529366400,1,plea stop use recycl chip bag make thing ive mani sleepless night someon tent 50 foot away sleep neoair xlite peopl tri save 8 ounc plea carri extra ounc everyon around tent site shelter stop spit cook pot dont keep awak night insist sleep bag chip least bring bag ruffl frito dorito share around campfir also weight pad mislead klymit static v insul pad 72 x 23 x 25 weigh 24 oz also make lite version 20 oz static v 23 wide top bottom essenti rectangl thermarest reduc weight pad part reduc size 72 x 20 x 25 1440 sq inch sleep surfac oppos 1656 sq inch klymit 13 le pad may sound like much im 60 tall 215 lb 45 chest bare fit klymit im back trim three inch width shoulder would extend pad that annoy get wors klymit rectangl neoair xlite mummi cut taper toward foot probabl lose anoth 140 sq inch 10 surfac area taper your pad 25 smaller doesnt realli fit larg guy well your pretti much forc sleep

Unfortunately, the new chain was about 4 inches too short to replace the original chain. Not sure why, but it was. I still had usable sections of links from the old chain so I skipped using the master link provided with the new chain and added a 4 inch section from my old chain to make the new chain the right length. Learning how to properly use my new chain break tool was an experience in trial and error (and watching a couple of YouTube ""How To"" videos) but, with patience, I succeeded and am now a master chain breaker/joiner! Empowering! Very nice tool. The curved wire that stores in the handle is helpful in holding the chain in place while you work on it but for this particular extension job, it was a bit too short. A little trick I learned to hold the chain in place over the large gap I was dealing with was to use a long zip tie threaded thru the chain about an inch from the end of each end of the chain and to one side of the chain repair area (i.e., not looped around the repair area or you can't get the tool properly in place).",1529452800,5,rear derailleur went south bust torqu chain buy new one unfortun new chain 4 inch short replac origin chain sure still usabl section link old chain skip use master link provid new chain ad 4 inch section old chain make new chain right length learn properli use new chain break tool experi trial error watch coupl youtub video patienc succeed master chain breakerjoin empow nice tool curv wire store handl help hold chain place work particular extens job bit short littl trick learn hold chain place larg gap deal use long zip tie thread thru chain inch end end chain one side chain repair area ie loop around repair area cant get tool properli place

There are two tests per sheet and 5 sheets included. The paper tests are in a matchbook style folder. I think it would be great if that was then inside a vinyl holder or something to keep it from getting torn or dirty while being stored inside your purse. It says to make sure you read all the directions before administering a test. I found the directions to be extremely difficult to read because they are so tiny! I am not the target audience, so I guess that's okay. It's pretty easy to use. You put a drop of water on each of the test spots and then wait for it to dry which takes a few minutes. It's not a particularly discreet procedure. If you were on a blind date and took this out to test your drink, you can't easily hide your actions. I tested this using plain tap water. The directions say that the water will cause a light blue mark, which is normal.  Mine did just that. You're suppose to tear out the test sheet before testing the drink. But if you only use one test, you still have an unused test on the other half of the sheet, but there's really no place to put it securely.  I was not able to test it with anything that would cause it to have a positive reading, so I can only assume that it will work as indicated.

I did go ahead and remove the plastic tab on the lid because I use a twig stove and the flames do sometimes shoot up the side of whatever pot I am using--even if I used a grill, I would remove the tab; plastic and heat can be a problem. I just use a tine of my cooking fork through the little clip that used to hold the platic tab to lift the lid. Simpler that way anyway.

I have lower back issues and have been hesitant to use these, however after much research on form, I can now do it properly, without any strain on my lower back (check out the ATHLEANs YouTube page for outstanding info and tips). It is very effective, not just with core, but upper body in general. The only thing I have done in the last 21 days is add the ab Carver to my workout regimen, for you to see with the attached picture results. I am 32 years old, but I'm starting to feel like I'm 22 again. Best of luck in all of your healthy endeavors. It's not about how you look, it's about how you feel.

Update: Had the chance to use them last night. I don't know how far it casted but it went far before I heard the kerplunk from the weight and bait hitting the water. Wound it with 30 lb braid to 3way swivel. 4oz weight on the straight thru tied with 20lb mono, then on the 90 side of swivel again 20lb mono to 5/0 circle hook with live bait (blue gill).

One of the times I put it out the darn live bait must have wrapped a tree or rock as I hung up. The rod, reel, swivel and weighted sides all held up with the bending rod over pulling to get loose, yes I tried the gentle way too. What didn't hold up was my knot on the bait leader where it was attached at the swivel. It did take a beating however so all I lost was a hook.

Super pleased with the reel. Can't wait to go out again, in daylight, so I can see how far this thing casts.

First off, the quality is first rate. The double stitching is quality and the fact that they used nylon webbing to mount the grommets to is the deciding factor I used to buy this tarp over others. The stitching is even and complete. All tie down points use double material prior to stitching so the stress points are stronger by design.
There are a total of 18 tie-down points! This gives you so many options on how to tie it down and configure. This was another reason why I chose this tarp. The tie-downs (2 of them) on the top of the tarp are also a great feature for providing ridge line support without the need for poles.
I chose the green colored tarp. The color pretty much matches what you seen on Amazon. One side of the tarp has a heat reflecting material on it. It is similar to the color you would see on a car dashboard device. I have not used the tarp yet, but my first use will be in the Kalifornia desert at 100F. I will report back.
Many comments about the ""chintzy"" cord. I guess if you compare it to premier rope from REI, then it is lesser quality. But the cord is at least as durable and strong as any 550 paracord you will find at Walmart and hardware stores. The cord is reflective! The cord is simply a bonus, value added item that is definitely suited for use while camping.
The guy line tensioners that come with the cord are the standard 3-hole plastic devices that work well. I do not see a problem using these while camping. If you want to spend more, have at it!
The comments about them being cheap are correct. These are the type of stakes that come with many tarps and tents and should be considered front lawn/picnic area stakes. They are aluminum and will bend easy, so use them is soft ground only. For what I am using this tarp for, I use 12"" nails. The desert ground is dry, hard, and rocky and would destroy these stakes on the first hit with a 2lb hammer.
Their are grommets on all corners and 3 points on the top of the tarp. The grommets on all sides are spaces about 2 1/2 feet apart. One reviewer docked a star because they believed there were not enough grommets! 15 tie-down points around the perimeter, that is not enough? That person must live on the flat-lands of Wyoming!
The case for the tarp is NOT a stuff sack. You cannot just jam the tarp into the case. The material is thicker than the high-end, super thin Silnylon materials used on some tarps. You will have to fold then roll the tarp tight to get it and the stakes/line sack back into the carrying case. I plan to not put the stakes and line bag into the bigger carrying case.
I will update this review after my first use in the hot kalifornia desert sun. But for now, BUY this tarp. It is a no brainer. I bought the 10x13 for $40! Good luck finding ANYTHING that competes with this tarp for anywhere near the money being asked for it.

It was so hot out that we used it twice a day and used water from a river and from small creek puddles to filter. When we compared side-by-side with actual bottled water, it was difficult to distinguish between the two. Of course, this would depend on the quality of water source too. It does take a bit to fill bottles, but we averaged about 5 min per bottle so it would take about 20 minutes to fill 4 tall bottles and was not an issue for us.

23394,5937,16,"Received on-time... however compared to other online images of the same Wheeler sight pusher tool... the one I received appears to have been used. I purchased a $160 brand new one, not a $140 Amazon Warehouse unit, so this alarmed me.

There are visible dark lines where a slide would sit, on the floor side of my tool, corresponding to parkerizing scratching or embedding into the gold anodization, and the pusher block ('H'-shaped black piece that actually contacts your sights) was scratched more than even promo images of the tool reveal (which vary from smooth and blem-free, to looking like it was thrown in a bin full of thousands of sharp steel 'H'es)...

Returning for an actually new one -- I hope no one in the warehouse this was sent from is trying to install sights on his/her weapon without paying for one.

First image: web image of new, unused unit -- notice no lines or marks on the floor of the tool where the slide is clamped in place.

Second image: my unit, which clearly shows two black lines that can't be wiped clean. Running a fingernail over them, they seem to be rougher than surrounding gold anodization. Not happy about that.

Third image: the 'H' pusher block, scratched more than trivially, and not at all in line with Wheeler's 'precision instrument' marketing.

The pusher block being scratched wouldn't be a dealbreaker... but the black marks all over my brand-new unit certainly are.

--

25 JUN 2018 -- this purchase experience is proving to be a comedy of errors...

First, I buy in good faith a brand-new product at a brand-new price point, which shows signs of use -- not good.

Amazon tries to mend this obviously disagreeable situation, by sending out a replacement. I in good faith send back the used unit stat.

Now despite the replacement being sent via FedEx (a carrier least likely to violate on-time shipment IME)... it's late and stuck in L.A.

Already missed one open range day here waiting for this tool... am wondering if the other day left this month is also wasted. :/

--

26 JUN 2018 -- arrived. No slide marks on the floor half of the tool... or any other sign this tool was used. A few nicks (probably occurred before anodizing, as the anodized gold color fills in the nicks), but considering what it replaced, I can live with it. The 'H'-shaped pusher block is less beat-up-looking than the first used unit, which I'm delighted about.

Now finally -- my review of a fresh-out-of-box Wheeler sight tool for adjusting my Sig P320 rear sight...

The index marks on the floor of the tool are *essential* for getting your sights aligned properly and moved without incident... and so it was. The $200+ MGW tool may be a bit more secure with slide retention... but not $50 more. ;)",1529539200,4,receiv ontim howev compar onlin imag wheeler sight pusher tool one receiv appear use purchas 160 brand new one 140 amazon warehous unit alarm visibl dark line slide would sit floor side tool correspond parker scratch embed gold anod pusher block hshape black piec actual contact sight scratch even promo imag tool reveal vari smooth blemfre look like thrown bin full thousand sharp steel he return actual new one hope one warehous sent tri instal sight hisher weapon without pay one first imag web imag new unus unit notic line mark floor tool slide clamp place second imag unit clearli show two black line cant wipe clean run fingernail seem rougher surround gold anod happi third imag h pusher block scratch trivial line wheeler precis instrument market pusher block scratch wouldnt dealbreak black mark brandnew unit certainli 25 jun 2018 purchas experi prove comedi error first buy good faith brandnew product brandnew price point show sign use good amazon tri mend obvious disagre situat send replac good faith send back use unit stat

 Both in hardness bounce and so on.  The problem that I discovered they have a rough texture to them that will scratch the surface of your table.  I have found that the blue label balls do the same thing.  You can test the abrasiveness by rubbing one of these balls against anything that is clear plastic.  Like a small storage box.  These balls will leave a mark, a bunch of scratches.  The iPong balls I have do not leave a mark.  The Stiga 3 Star balls that I have do not leave a mark.  If you have a new table and do not want to mess up the finish of the top, do not buy these balls.

***Update***  For general use these balls may be fine.  For robot use and high spin training the abrasiveness of these balls will chew up some tables.  It also will chew up the rubber on your bat.

23576,208,4437,"I hate water bottles. Being a member of Amazon Vine I've been sent dozens and hated them all. I get that they have a purpose, but they're all the same; bulky, hard to open, leak, too big for my small hands. Occasionally they'll put a ball inside them and call them a protein shake bottle, but in the end, they're all the same.

Not this one.

I researched water bottles for months (yeah, I'm that guy) before I came to the conclusion to purchase this one just to try it. It didn't look like anything fantastic in the photos, it looked the same as all the other ones. Reviews and ratings were on point, and there was a ""used"" one for four dollars cheaper than the normal price, so why not give it a shot.

It arrived and I instantly fell in love with it.

The grey color is fantastic. And it's small. So small I can easily grab it with my hands. But it's also long, so it holds a good bit (18 oz, duh) of water. There's a wrist strap that's permanently affixed to the bottle, but rotates freely around the bottle.

The lid... Let me tell you about this lid! For the person who always has to have everything lined up... The front of the lid always lines up with the logo on the front of the bottle. I love this. The top clasps down and it has a lock. The one button flip top is fantastical, enabling one handed operation with this water bottle.

There's also a secret easter egg inside this water bottle... It has a screen located at the top that fits just into the neck of the bottle. You have to remove it to fill it up, but make sure you put it back. You know how when you go to take a drink from a water bottle full of crushed ice and that ice hits your drinking hole or hits you in the face and it blocks all the water? Yeah. This screen prevents that very thing from happening.

I bought a second one. I love it just as much as the first. One for home, one for work. I will buy more. One for the gym, another for the boat, and finally one for my car. Yes, I need that many. Fantastic! Just plain fantastic!!",1529798400,5,hate water bottl member amazon vine ive sent dozen hate get purpos theyr bulki hard open leak big small hand occasion theyll put ball insid call protein shake bottl end theyr one research water bottl month yeah im guy came conclus purchas one tri didnt look like anyth fantast photo look one review rate point use one four dollar cheaper normal price give shot arriv instantli fell love grey color fantast small small easili grab hand also long hold good bit 18 oz duh water there wrist strap that perman affix bottl rotat freeli around bottl lid let tell lid person alway everyth line front lid alway line logo front bottl love top clasp lock one button flip top fantast enabl one hand oper water bottl there also secret easter egg insid water bottl screen locat top fit neck bottl remov fill make sure put

23649,443,4361,"Given the lean expense of this they should issue one to every college girl as a part of her welcome package.  I don't have any knockout drugs so I couldn't actually test this, but it seems easy enough to use.  It might appear indiscrete using it at the bar or table on a date, but If your date suddenly gets the urge to leave, you might have an idea of how the test will come out.  I knew some girls at the apartment complex where I stayed in Houston in the 80's that could have used this.  They never saw the guy again, but they were very paranoid after that, and stayed mostly at home.  In the early 80s there were just the rumors of this killer disease, so a lot of people were cautious.  There was no test back then, so it was a scary thing if you were assaulted.  This won't help if you are going to indulge in heavy alcohol drinking or a combination of drugs, and alcohol.  If you are going to live like that you're trusting a lot to luck.

It's a bit insulting to a man to tell him to watch your purse or your drink.  I've been asked to do that one too many times.  While I was diligent about it, I sometimes wondered if someone came and took the girls purse, if I would bother stopping them.  I might of thought it was funny just to say well I watched it for you and somebody took it.

The blade was not as sharp out-of-the-box as I would like (the reason I gave it 4 stars), but wasn't too hard to sharpen, and the full flat grind makes this an excellent slicer.  The handle is moderately comfortable and ergonomic, and the twist lock works well both with the blade open and closed.  Like I said I would never use this as a primary knife, but it makes for an EXCELLENT food prep knife.

- the edges started to roll up and the mat refused to lie flat
- there's quite a bit of bunching between the towel side + the rubber side, so I had to interrupt my practice to smooth it back out
- the mat moved quite a bit when transitioning, even in small light movements
- the mat itself will not dry out. It's thin (I like that) but seems to just be a sponge for sweat. I laid it flat out in 90 degree hot sun for an entire day and it was still wet. I tried a cold laundry wash then hung it to dry, that was a few days ago and it's still wet.

The color is what attracted me at first, since I was looking specifically for White and Black as my Sirrus is white with black.  Also, the screws/studs were pronounced and from reviews these looked like a solid buy, especially at less than $30.

23814,5925,3409,"I have been riding Shimano pedals for most of my riding time (10+ years), and especially enjoyed SPD on  my cross bike. The pair of XT-M8020 has been on my cross for 4 years now and stills function like new. So I am a bit interested to try out this Crank Bros. I was hoping that the CB is significantly better, possibly convinces me enough to switch.

To start, the CB comes with excellent instruction. That is a step above all others that mostly came with a little sheet of paper that tells you where to get a full manual online. Everything was detailed, from measuring mounting slots of your shoes to what force is need to install cleats and pedal. Also, how to clip in/out.

This pair of pedals design for all types of riding: mountain bike, cyclocross and commuter. Large platform helps with power transfer and ease of clipping. For the day that you only need a ride around town, flat side allows regular shoes.  I had a little trouble at first clipping in on my left, but it was fine after a couple minutes practicing.

I believe Crank Brothers' pedals are much easier for beginners who want try clipping in versus Shimano SPD. As far as performance, you would get the same level on both. However, there are more versions to chose in the CB side. But for me, they work the same and not  a lot of reasons for me to switch.",1529971200,4,ride shimano pedal ride time 10 year especi enjoy spd cross bike pair xtm8020 cross 4 year still function like new bit interest tri crank bro hope cb significantli better possibl convinc enough switch start cb come excel instruct step other mostli came littl sheet paper tell get full manual onlin everyth detail measur mount slot shoe forc need instal cleat pedal also clip inout pair pedal design type ride mountain bike cyclocross commut larg platform help power transfer ea clip day need ride around town flat side allow regular shoe littl troubl first clip left fine coupl minut practic believ crank brother pedal much easier beginn want tri clip versu shimano spd far perform would get level howev version chose cb side work lot reason switch

I have owned much more expensive rods in the past (and still have a few) that are nowhere near being on par with this one. This rod has the backbone to land VERY large fish while still being sensitive enough to fell the bite of a small blue gill or sunfish. There aren't many rods on the market that are equally as adept at catching huge Northern Pike and small to medium sized pan fish. This one does it all!

It also is very capable of casting a country mile. I've paired mine up with a KastKing Royale Legend, high speed, low-profile bait caster and I couldn't possibly be happier with the combination. Obviously you could match it with whatever reel you have or wish to buy. But that's the combo I use and I absolutely love it.

I am very picky when it comes to my fishing gear. If it doesn't work, I don't care how much I paid for it. Garbage is garbage, regardless of the name on the label or the price tag. I'm here to tell you that this rod is FAR from garbage. In fact, it's one of the best overall rods I have ever used. I don't have money to burn, so when I come across a deal like this, I tend to be a little skeptical. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that the high praise for this rod was well earned.

More importantly, I know quality when I USE it. I've used this reel several times and I couldn't possibly be happier with it. Yes, I am definitely still a novice when it comes to casting a baitcaster, but I'm getting there. I've had a few wicked backlashes and some pretty nasty birds nests. But I was well aware of the fact that there would be a little learning curve with a reel like this. I honestly think I would have a LOT more birds nests if I had started out using a different brand or even a different model. I believe this is probably one of the easier BC style reels for a beginner to learn on.

It's not very difficult to cast this thing a country mile if you know what you're doing. While I don't consider myself to be an expert with bait casters, I have had my share (maybe accidentally? LOL) of truly GREAT casts with this reel. I don't know if it's because I'm getting better or simply because this reel is just that great. Either way, I'll take it!

For what it's worth, I paired my reel up with an Entsport Camo Legend 2 piece, 7' casting rod and I couldn't possibly be happier with the combo. I've always been a firm believer that the perfect fishing reel needs to be paired with the perfect rod. Just kind of makes sense, at least to me. I also am a firm believer that, like KastKing, Entsport is a very under rated, budget friendly brand that should not be overlooked for some of the higher end, much pricier names. Much the same way I am a Mossberg 500 guy when it comes to shotguns. Lower price doesn't always equate to ""cheaper"" and you don't always get what you pay for. There are times when that is true. But there are also times where you're really only paying for the name that's on the label.

If you're in the market for a new bait caster reel, you should definitely give this one a shot. And maybe even take my advice and partner it up with the rod I was talking about. I truly believe you'll be happy with that decision.",1529971200,5,absolut love reel first ever bait caster dont realli much compar know qualiti see importantli know qualiti use ive use reel sever time couldnt possibl happier ye definit still novic come cast baitcast im get ive wick backlash pretti nasti bird nest well awar fact would littl learn curv reel like honestli think would lot bird nest start use differ brand even differ model believ probabl one easier bc style reel beginn learn difficult cast thing countri mile know your dont consid expert bait caster share mayb accident lol truli great cast reel dont know im get better simpli reel great either way ill take worth pair reel entsport camo legend 2 piec 7 cast rod couldnt possibl happier combo ive alway firm believ perfect fish reel need pair perfect rod kind make sen least also firm believ like kastk entsport rate budget friendli brand overlook higher end much pricier

I have never trained with bands, I can tell there is a big difference, and for sure I like it. They are really nice to work your muscles whole range of movement, works in the opposite direction of dumbells and weights. With weights it become easier to lift when you are completing the movement, like a curl, it is hard to lift the first half way, then it is easier to go the other half, with these it is all the way around, it is a nice complement even if you can go to a real gym. Im getting decent pumps just with these, and you can combine them to get more resistance for biceps, chest and back.
Quality wise these are really nice, I took my time to review just to try them well enough, they look like new after a month of heavy use, and all the accessories they come with are enough to train your whole body.
The excercise guide could be more complete, but I have been at the gym for 12 years so i figured out how to train all my body with these ones. Also there are hundreds of training videos on youtube.

23930,6143,2879,"Received them this morning, appear to be well made. I have only fired off 10 of them from 1 of my 5 air rifles. Today's trial had come out of my Benjamin Jim Shockey rifle. The rifle is zeroed in very well and fires well, these pellets fired from it were pretty impressive. I have read some reviews of deformed pellets, odd sizes, and errant flyers. Thus far none of the above in today's intro to these pellets. As mentioned, rifle is well zeroed in and seasoned shooter, Set up target, and as if in zeroing the scope, started out at 10 yards and then repeating adding on the 10 yards to previous. each and everyone of the shots ended up within the orange spot within the center of the target, as I progressed with the shooting I did notice, and possibly it was myself, the pellet favoring the right, yet pretty much dead level with prior shots. My only concern with this pellet is of course the weight of the pellet itself.  I had thought during my order, that they were at least 13 grain, yet 9.8, big difference . The true test will come however when I do take that shot on a feral creature. With the Lychee fruits dropping from the tree's here on Kauai, pigs galore come to feed at night on them, have shot three pigs this past week alone. So possibly will be putting this to the 'Hunting' test sooner rather than latter. The pellet material feels or appears to be pretty dense in it self. Curious as to how the impact on the eye socket or ear shot with these on a pig up to 35 yards will be. Within 35 yards or so, this pellet, while firing at a stationary target with only one of my air rifles appears to pretty accurate, or has good shooting characteristics. I actually hope the pigs come to feed tonight. Have a Lychee tree no more than 25 feet from my front door, chances are pretty good that I will be able to test it out tonight.

Finally I removed the right grip and the noise stopped. The metal ring tightens down tight on the handlebar, but the grip itself does not.

24001,6799,1177,"Ordered two of these as I have a friend that takes me hinting with him and has for the last 40 years. When I bought my first Muzzle Loader I got him one too. Same with drop hammer center fires 35 Whelens when they became legal here for Primitive weapons. Now we are both old and can not draw our bows the way we did when young so I decided it was time to step up to the crossbow. Both arrived by UPS on time which was never in doubt with me. Both had red circular open stickers on the large flap where one opens them obviously. One had already been opened as the sticker was torn apart. I have not removed anything from the boxes yet but again one had been opened before it arrived here. Is this the norm??? When he gets here we will begin the assembling of them both. I will keep any of you that are curious posted as to what happens. When I order something I do not wish to see that it has been opened before it arrives here. I've read where this has happened to others and they got damaged goods. Just from a quick look inside the opened one it appears that everything is there, but that in no way means it is not damaged. We have a few days here to find out if any of it is damaged. Again are all of these shipped out with these red circular open stickers??? Certainly if they are they should not already have been opened. If I find I need to apologize I assure you that I will. The crossbow itself I suspect I will love. The one star is for the already opened product being sent to me as if it were new an unopened. That should never happen in my opinion. This upsets my snowflake self no end. Please anyone out there that can help me either make a bigger fool of myself or help me understand please do. Did everyone get a crossbow with these stickers on them and were any already opened as obviously the sticker was ripped in half.

24020,954,4453,"This thing is pretty serious.  Has some good features.  It's kind of complicated, so in order to reduce text, I made pix pointing things out.  Most of my review is comments on the pix.

Main bag:
- The zips are all avg size teeth, plastic.  Zip pulls are quite unique to me, and sturdy. One of my pix shows them.
- Shoulder straps are well padded, and back is even more padded. Very nice, since backpack is large and if you fill it up, it'll weigh a lot.

- There's an odd feature in the 2nd pocket from the front.  Marked on one of my pix.  There's another, full-length pocket behind there, and that strap goes down in it and attaches to the opposite wall, about 2"" from the bottom.

A total guess, because the listing info nor info that comes with the product mentions it, and I've never seen it before, but it seems like it could be used for something flat and if it's an item that's not so tall, you can pull on that strap which would slide the item to the top of that pocket so you can reach it easier.

If you use it for wide, flat things, you can't ignore the strap, so you lose 2"" or so of length space, but I can actually see some people getting some use from it, so I guess it's fine.

(Please remember pix can take 2+ days longer to show up than the review)

- Overall, I'm taking 1 star off for what I consider poor listing info on a complicated/detailed item like this, at its current price point, and while their pix are decent, there should have been more.

Otherwise, I find this sturdy, extremely flexible, and really good for people who need to carry a lot around.  Those padded straps really relieve weight stress.  Decently visually good looking, too.

(Note: I'm not covering the yellow rain cover because I didn't get one, but don't read anything into that.  It's not unusual in Vine, we often don't get accessories.)

It's useful that it comes with metal clips and a shoulder pad. But the limited adjustment feature was a deal breaker.

There was only 1 night I actually felt cold on the entire trail (high in the Pyrenees). Keep in mind I was not in a tent, I was INDOORS at hostals/albergues.
With that being said, I don't believe it would be anywhere near a 35 degree bag sleeping outdoors in a tent, regardless of what type of pad you used under it or base layers you were wearing. I would say it would be a perfect summer type bag that would easily keep you warm when summer camping/hiking.

Really nice to have the option to use either flat shoes or cleated shoes on the same pedals. The pedals are big enough that the flat side is very stable and flipping to the side you want is easy. The cleated side is easy enough to click in and out. It feels a little different from the eggbeater pedals, but I got used to that quickly. I use the same shoes/cleats that I use with the eggbeater pedals with no problems. A new set of Crank Brothers cleats is included with the pedals for people that are new to Crank Brothers.

I'm using the cheapest 1-series version of these pedals. The 2-series has more durable bearings, which frequent users will probably want. The 3-series has the improved bearings as well as adjustable studs on the flat side of the pedal. Use a small hex wrench to raise or lower the stud height. This is a nice feature if you want to fine tune studs' grip to your shoes (or lower them entirely so they don't chew up your shoes).",1530403200,4,ive use crank brother eggbeat pedal mani year got doubleshot pedal commut bike realli nice option use either flat shoe cleat shoe pedal pedal big enough flat side stabl flip side want easi cleat side easi enough click feel littl differ eggbeat pedal got use quickli use shoescleat use eggbeat pedal problem new set crank brother cleat includ pedal peopl new crank brother im use cheapest 1seri version pedal 2seri durabl bear frequent user probabl want 3seri improv bear well adjust stud flat side pedal use small hex wrench rais lower stud height nice featur want fine tune stud grip shoe lower entir dont chew shoe

Baleaf contacted me after this review and asked me to take some measurements to send to them to see about a different size and to improve their product. I responded and they promptly sent me the next larger size. Honestly, I noticed very little difference in the fit of the larger size. It still sat very low on my waist / hips.

24394,762,1549,"I have seen several reports and YouTubers talking about this particular filter failing out of the blue where you can't squeeze any water through for no apparent reason at all. I never got it until my recent trip to Yosemite. I have never brought this filter into any freezing conditions and living in the SF Bay Area, it has never frozen before in storage (we might get down to freezing maybe 1-2 nights a year and indoors never gets down to those temperatures anyways). I always check the weather forecast before hand and if it shows the area I'm heading to will drop below 40F at night, I will leave the filter at home and just bring my Steripen and stove.

I have had this filter now for almost 3 years, and took it on maybe 20-30 trips max filtering 20-30 liters max (and it was all clear running water), I think I'm closer to the 20 liters mark! Just small day trips and usually I used this as a backup for hand washing water and to give demos to my friends. I always after each trip backflushed it vigorously with the syringe multiple times every time with tap water. Afterwards, I'd try to shake out as much water from inside the filter as I can and let it dry out. It always worked previously for all these trips until my recent trip.

In the recent trip, I ran out of hand washing water in my car in Yosemite so I went and gathered some lake water to filter (very clear water up at Tenaya Lake). No matter how I squeezed, nothing but maybe 2-3 drops of water came out and I was squeezing so hard if I felt if I squeezed any harder the bag would have burst. It stopped working entirely. Went from a super fast flow in the past to now a suddenly no water at all. I'm just glad I wasn't in a situation where I really had to depend on this filter for clean drinking water!

On the other hand I had a 2nd unit in my car which I've only tested once by filtering tap water. That worked as my backup for the rest of my trip. That filtered fine, although at this point, I'm not sure for how long.

I have not contacted Sawyer about the issue so far mainly because I've heard from several YouTubers who also had the same issue as me, their warranty department usually says it is user error and doesn't help at all (and they also reported having an extremely hard time getting a hold of anyone in their customer service department). I'm now switching my filter to a Katadyn BeFree or my MSR TrailShot along with my Steripen for an extra layer of protection. This filter is not dependable as you never know when it will fail immediately. I'm really not sure what went wrong, because before the trip, I backflushed some air through the clean side and I felt it coming out the dirty side, so there isn't really anything blocking the flow.",1530489600,1,seen sever report youtub talk particular filter fail blue cant squeez water appar reason never got recent trip yosemit never brought filter freez condit live sf bay area never frozen storag might get freez mayb 12 night year indoor never get temperatur anyway alway check weather forecast hand show area im head drop 40f night leav filter home bring steripen stove filter almost 3 year took mayb 2030 trip max filter 2030 liter max clear run water think im closer 20 liter mark small day trip usual use backup hand wash water give demo friend alway trip backflush vigor syring multipl time everi time tap water afterward id tri shake much water insid filter let dri alway work previous trip recent trip recent trip ran hand wash water car yosemit went gather lake water filter clear water tenaya lake matter squeez noth mayb 23 drop water came squeez hard felt squeez harder bag would burst

24400,5961,1629,"This Books C17 saddle is modeled after their classic B17 leather saddle, but with a weather-resistant vegan-friendly rubber top instead of cowhide. Shape and fit is very similar to the B17, except that it is lighter weight, more weather resistant, and breaks in much more quickly. This is still a big heavy saddle, weighing twice as much as a typical road racing saddle, but these are designed more for touring riders and commuters who don't care about weight. The saddles are so comfortable that you can wear regular street clothes instead of padded bicycling shorts. The saddle is not padded; the comfort comes from the flex in the saddle when you sit on it. The rubber top is rougher (at least when new) than the old leather saddles, so maybe avoid wearing soft cotton pants at least for the first few rides. Brooks Cambium saddles come in several different shapes and widths. The C17 model is one of the widest and works best for people with a more upright riding position (not necessarily a wider rear end). If you can, I advise trying some of the others before deciding which to buy.

24457,1164,4397,"This is a heavy duty, and nicely finished, bike lock. The one deficiency I found is one that is really just a matter of paying attention to the listing specs. That is, the shank is a bit short, so you can't just dock your bike anywhere - you have to know where you can lock up to.

Pros:
1. Comes with frame mounted bracket to carry it instead of making a hard lump in your pack.
2. The lock bar can go on either direction. I tested this out a bunch of ways and I think the folks who had trouble with it may have had rough samples or something. I could lock/unlock it with it in either direction.
3. The colored lock bar is nice so it doesn't just blend with the terrain if you set it down while getting things settled with your bike.
4. Lock action is smooth - keys fit fine.

Cons:
1. I think they could use a bit more detail on the product description about how to use a shorter U shank like this one. That is, really make sure we all know what we are doing when we get a shorter U. My kids previously used U shank locks, but the U was about twice as long which meant they never had to hunt around to find a place to lock to. Once again, this is not kept exactly secret, but knowing the application examples would be helpful.

24497,6912,1968,"If you're looking for some bicycle lights and you don't frequently ride in the mornings/nights this should do the job. If you're someone who does a lot of riding where lights are needed, you might want to look elsewhere for something brighter and rechargeable.

Packaging as others noted was good. In addition to what you paid for (2x headlights, backlights and mount) you get an extra 4 batteries for the flashing rear lights which was a nice gesture. The flashing rear lights already came with batteries installed as well. They provide 6x AAA batteries that go into the headlight (3x per light)

Function - the headlights have 3 modes: full on, dimmer full on and flashing mode. you can change the uhh beam by turning the top. you can make it focused/concentrated or open it up wide. you simply push the button on the back. the flashing rear lights also have 3 modes: always on, hyper active blinking and slower blinking.

Installation - breeze. the mount is hand tightened. the rear flashing lights are pretty self explanatory. I used a flathead screwdriver to open the ""latch"" for the silicon to hook onto.

Visibility - I got this because I ride on a beach trail on the weekends around 5:30-6am. at this time in the summer the sun is already rising but I just use it as a precaution. Based on what I see the rear flashing lights are very visible based on the typical proximity of other riders/people on the trail. it wasn't dark enough for me to see how far the headlights reach but when used as a flashlight in pitch darkness it was able to light up at least 30 ft infront of me.

Overall, I think this is a solid deal for a pair of headlights/rear lights. Since I might only use these a few hours a month, i chose to go with this. If you're a frequent rider and plan on using this a lot, it might be better if could see if these can take rechargeable or find one that also recharging.",1530576000,5,your look bicycl light dont frequent ride morningsnight job your someon lot ride light need might want look elsewher someth brighter recharg packag other note good addit paid 2x headlight backlight mount get extra 4 batteri flash rear light nice gestur flash rear light alreadi came batteri instal well provid 6x aaa batteri go headlight 3x per light function headlight 3 mode full dimmer full flash mode chang uhh beam turn top make focusedconcentr open wide simpli push button back flash rear light also 3 mode alway hyper activ blink slower blink instal breez mount hand tighten rear flash light pretti self explanatori use flathead screwdriv open latch silicon hook onto visibl got ride beach trail weekend around 5306am time summer sun alreadi rise use precaut base see rear flash light visibl base typic proxim riderspeopl trail wasnt dark enough see far headlight reach use flashlight pitch dark abl light least 30 ft infront overal think solid deal pair headlightsrear light sinc might

24594,5925,4471,"I have several Selle saddles on my road bike, most recently a Selle Italia. A couple of years ago I switched to Fizik because Selle saddles were just too uncomfortable for me. With Selle Italias thin padding, my butt would scream in pain after 30 miles on normal pavement. I thought it needs some getting used to and better with more rides, but it only got to the point of acceptable. My butt , back and shoulders still hurt after long ride. You know it if you are so looking forward to the finish point, just to get off the bike. I settled on Fiziks Bull version, as that was the only saddle I felt most comfortable with. Then one day I ran across Selle SMP Hybrid. What a difference! I now have Selle SMP Hybrid on all my bikes. So I am very interested to see how this Selle Royal compares to my SMP Hybrid.

From first feel, the Selle Royal M3 was big, soft and heavy. I put it on my cyclocross and went for a ride. After about 10 miles, the sides of the saddle started rubbing on my thighs. I found that I shifted my position too many times, probably because the saddle was too soft. But no pain whatsoever.  You are supposed to shift to different positions on the saddle when riding, but that was too many.

My opinion is this saddle is great for commuting, where you ride around 10-15 miles each way, not for long distance endurance ride on road bike. It is also great for mountain biking, that you don't sit on the saddle for long stretch of time.",1530662400,4,sever sell saddl road bike recent sell italia coupl year ago switch fizik sell saddl uncomfort sell italia thin pad butt would scream pain 30 mile normal pavement thought need get use better ride got point accept butt back shoulder still hurt long ride know look forward finish point get bike settl fizik bull version saddl felt comfort one day ran across sell smp hybrid differ sell smp hybrid bike interest see sell royal compar smp hybrid first feel sell royal m3 big soft heavi put cyclocross went ride 10 mile side saddl start rub thigh found shift posit mani time probabl saddl soft pain whatsoev suppos shift differ posit saddl ride mani opinion saddl great commut ride around 1015 mile way long distanc endur ride road bike also great mountain bike dont sit saddl long stretch time

I adjusted the saddle as much as I could and even tried different positions. It just wasn't as comfortable as my Fizik Antares R3 with K:Ium Rails (Large). The Antares is a stiffer saddle design, but when installed on my bike, it is more forgiving than the Brooks. The Fizik is also over 220 grams lighter than the Brooks C17 (which is a delta of about 0.5 pounds). YMMV, so try different saddles if possible.

Its height adjustability allows it to work on most if not all guns in my opinion. Moreover as the video shows, it doesnt grip right below the front sights, which is good because some gun, including my p226, run parallel from the back but near the front it caves inward so if the holding pins grabs onto that, it will not be straight. Although it is expensive, it works and there isn't much options out there. There are more expensive ones that probably do the same job. And I don't feel like using a punch and hammer because that just becomes annoying trying to hammer just right to get the sight where you want it. This is simple and again, it works! As far as protecting gun details, i found that using 4 piece of felt pad for the pins was all that is necessary. The top and bottom won't scratch the gun. The pusher might scratch the sight but I feel like its more important to be able to see point of contact than protecting the gun from scratches, especially since its only the sight.

Pros:

Great Value - Came with semi hard case and 5 switchable lenses. the lenses also came with a lens case that stored all 5 of them to protect them from scratching.

Does the job - the tints do their respective job in terms of what the tint it supposed to do.

Cons:

Build quality. When i put these on for the first time, i noticed one side was noticeably higher on my face than the other. When i put it on a flat surface, you can tell the build quality was way off. its completely uneven. Some of the lenses don't fit as snugly as others. for example, the red tint fits the frame snugly whereas the black one is very loose.

The water was crystal clear- and I gave him flies- he let me fish.  I tied that goofy fly on, and I could see the fish rising to look at it- -they were curious- but they never even considered taking a little taste- they looked and left.  Every time I tossed it in- and it floated down to them they would rise, look, go back home.  I suspect that AT THE VERY BEST---these flies will do the same.

First off, I was using the stock saddle on my budget bike which was the biggest contributing factor. I did some research online and came upon these padded biking shorts. I bought a pair and it's been the best purchase I've made since buying a bike.

As others have pointed out, the picture of the item is inside out to show you what the pad looks like. You wear them with the pads on the inside. Normally you just wear them as underwear aka you make direct contact with your nether regions on it, but that kinda skeezed me out. I opted to wear compression shorts then these ontop, so I sized up. Then shorts ontop of that! I'm 5'9"", 135lbs and got a medium.

Anyways, back to the purpose of these shorts - they make such a difference on long rides. I no longer feel sore wearing these. I did 26 miles yesterday and felt great.

24726,2001,375,"I purchased these after getting tired of the headaches and ear pain my Howard Leight Impact Sports were causing. These definitely helped with the issue and I can wear them longer, but I will still experience ear pain after extended use. My main issue is that I have abnormally large ears. They are so large that they press on the inside of the muffs, right up against the speaker. On most electronic muffs and headphones this area is only lightly padded, so eventually the hard plastic pressing on the outside of my ears begins to hurt.

Pros:

More comfortable than Howard Leight Impact Sports, thicker padding, less tight band

Higher level of sound protection, better seal than Impact Sports (I can use non-magnum pistols comfortably without additional plugs)

The flat dark earth color is nice with a matte finish

Overall build quality is good

Easy to find tactile volume knob

Cons:

Sound quality on these is worse than the Howard Leight Impact Sports.  The Impacts have a much more natural quality and more positional sound.  The amplification volume isn't as loud as the Howard Leights either. I have to strain to listen to speech through the foam plugs I wear under the muffs, while the Howard Leights were louder. The overall quality of sound is also lower with the Walkers. It sounds like you're talking to someone through a bathroom door: distant and muffled.

Do not offer positional sound at all, so you can't tell what direction a sound is coming from. This can be a little confusing on the range when listening to others talk and not knowing which way to look.

Thicker ear cups hit rifle stocks

Overall I prefer these to the Howard Leight's just because they are more comfortable and offer more protection. You can still hear much better with these over foam plugs than with foam plugs alone. In the future I will probably purcahse gel cups for the Howard Leight Impact Sports and relegate these Walker's to guest use.",1530835200,4,purchas get tire headach ear pain howard leight impact sport caus definit help issu wear longer still experi ear pain extend use main issu abnorm larg ear larg press insid muff right speaker electron muff headphon area lightli pad eventu hard plastic press outsid ear begin hurt pro comfort howard leight impact sport thicker pad le tight band higher level sound protect better seal impact sport use nonmagnum pistol comfort without addit plug flat dark earth color nice matt finish overal build qualiti good easi find tactil volum knob con sound qualiti wors howard leight impact sport impact much natur qualiti posit sound amplif volum isnt loud howard leight either strain listen speech foam plug wear muff howard leight louder overal qualiti sound also lower walker sound like your talk someon bathroom door distant muffl offer posit sound cant tell direct sound come littl confus rang listen other talk know way look thicker ear cup hit rifl stock overal prefer howard leight comfort offer protect still

I weigh 120 lbs and if you unscrew the spring too far your saddle will bounce.  Actually as the spring becomes worn you should tighten it periodically anyway.

-1 star for placing the button on the back of the unit, where it is not easily pressed, once mounted. Someone just did a lazy redesign of other tail lights instead of changing the mold of the main outer cover to have the button conveniently placed.

I can still turn it on and off, but I can only get the button with the tip of my finger; it's just not very conveniently located.

It is mounted to a Bontrager heavy duty rack.",1530921600,4,bright superflash type tail light wouldnt easili seen day exampl your le hardcor mostli want dark excel coupl differ flash mode well steadi 1 star place button back unit easili press mount someon lazi redesign tail light instead chang mold main outer cover button conveni place still turn get button tip finger conveni locat mount bontrag heavi duti rack

24789,4345,306,"I almost bought the Lifestraw, but I got this Sawyer Mini filter instead due to it's universal applications to hydration bladders and water bags, and maaan am I glad I did! This is my first water filter aside from a Lifestraw bottle I had recieved as a gift. I like how small and light it is, which makes it a great and convenient addition to my backpacking gear for camping or emergencies where I have run out of water! I tested this filter at home with water I had gotten from a creek earlier that day. Reason for me to do this was to be home safe and sound in the case that the Sawyer Mini could not filter the muddy/merky creek water! And guess what? It worked! I had no symptoms that often occur when you drink unclean water you would find in a lake, river or creek.

So, for ONLY $20, you get a water bag, re-usable straw, syringe for cleaning, and the Sawyer Mini (all very simple to use and all will last a lifetime most-likely), which in my opinion is a good bang for the buck! If you hike, camp or backpack a lot, you WILL want this filter.

Be warned, the taste of the filtered water is not so good, but that happens even when filtering clean filtered water with the Mini, but do not worry, just man up and get used to the taste, especially since this filter does an excellent job for it's sole purpose, MAKING OUTDOOR WATER DRINKABLE/SAFE!!!
