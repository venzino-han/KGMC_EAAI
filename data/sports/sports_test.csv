24846,4345,2973,"I have huge calves for my build, in which whenever I go walking at a quick-pace, my calves tighten up like CRAZY, to the point I feel like the sheath of my calves is going to tear open, leaving my calf muscles exposed. But, with these compression sleeves, OH MY GOD, I don't even need to stretch when going out in the city or out in nature for a hike (not that stretching would hurt or anything). I wish I had these back in highschool when I did soccer and volleyball!

On 6+mile hikes, my legs can get tired and feel weak, but luckily I had packed the sleeves in my backpack, and when I put them on, my legs no longer felt weak when standing or walking, I was able to hike A LOT more with these sleeves to aid me! Even on hot days, whether I am out and about, these sleeves are very breathable, letting air flow to my legs to keep them cool and prevent sweat from developing for a bit. I love them so much, that I told a relative about them and I soon bought a pair for them and they really love them! I have put these sleeves through a good amount, physically and aesthetically with a lot of dirt and stretching when on my hikes. Cleaning and drying them just like regular laundry, detergent and what not. I am VERY happy I have these, my constant calf cramping-issue has been resolved (;

This sleeve is good for anyone who experiences cramps anywhere between the knee and the ankle (front and back), but also good for anyone who would like to be able to run, hike, jump or walk more. This item is true to size, so use the sizing-chart featured in the other images of this product.

So to sum it all up, these sleeves are made of great durable material, very breathable, comfortable, easy to wash, and a great value for the benefits that come with wearing them!!!",1530921600,5,huge calv build whenev go walk quickpac calv tighten like crazi point feel like sheath calv go tear open leav calf muscl expo compress sleev oh god dont even need stretch go citi natur hike stretch would hurt anyth wish back highschool soccer volleybal 6mile hike leg get tire feel weak luckili pack sleev backpack put leg longer felt weak stand walk abl hike lot sleev aid even hot day whether sleev breathabl let air flow leg keep cool prevent sweat develop bit love much told rel soon bought pair realli love put sleev good amount physic aesthet lot dirt stretch hike clean dri like regular laundri deterg happi constant calf crampingissu resolv sleev good anyon experi cramp anywher knee ankl front back also good anyon would like abl run hike jump walk item true size use sizingchart featur

24861,5925,1629,"The saddle is beautifully made and looks modern. I always wonder what the saddle feels like when I saw them in stores. The leather one has a classic look that feel like they should be on some expensive bikes.  Since I don't have a commuter bike, I install this saddle on my cross bike to try out.

The saddle feels hard out of the box, but Brook leather saddle was known for adjusting to your anatomy and getting softer as you ride, I have very high hope for it. Well, after 2 rides of about 10-15 miles each, it was still as hard as the beginning and shown no sight of changing shape.  The saddles texture caused some abrasion on my riding short due to fair amount of rubbing as I rode. I guess it would take a ton more rides before I can adjust to this saddle, but that was not how a saddle was supposed to be made.

There is no question this saddle is beautiful and very well made. Only thing is, it only fits may be in some commuter bikes where people ride slow and short distance.

Here's the thing, in today's world, when you have a company who will take care of you if you are not satisfied...that's well worth the risk on a product you might want to try that may not be perfect. Baleaf totally addressed my needs and sent me a replacement pair of cycling specific shorts. I'm not a fan of cycling shorts in general due to the padding feeling like a diaper and the grippy material placed around the very bottom of the shorts so they don't slide around on your legs, however their shorts were better than any other cycling shorts I've ever tried and I'm happy to support a company who supports their customers. So, take the plunge on Baleaf, chances are great you'll love their product and if you don't, they'll take care of you.
Review 1:
Great shorts for any activity other than biking. The seam does irritate my hoo haa when I'm mountain biking, however they aren't advertised as biking shorts per say. I feel like any exercise pants like these should not have seams in the hoo haa region. That being said, they fit as expected, they have a nice pocket in the back for a key or a love note and if I weren't cycling, I can't say I'd even notice I had them on. I'd recommend, if the seam where outside of the inner sanctum, it'd be a 5 star baby!",1531180800,5,updat review 2 here thing today world compani take care satisfiedthat well worth risk product might want tri may perfect baleaf total address need sent replac pair cycl specif short im fan cycl short gener due pad feel like diaper grippi materi place around bottom short dont slide around leg howev short better cycl short ive ever tri im happi support compani support custom take plung baleaf chanc great youll love product dont theyll take care review 1 great short activ bike seam irrit hoo haa im mountain bike howev arent advertis bike short per say feel like exercis pant like seam hoo haa region said fit expect nice pocket back key love note werent cycl cant say id even notic id recommend seam outsid inner sanctum itd 5 star babi

25103,243,4397,"The German engineered (but manufactured in China) ABUS Ultra 410 Mini Bicycle U Lock is solid, portable security. It is wide enough to go through a wheel or attach to a bike rack or pole, but small enough to fit in a (large) pocket. Personally, I'll probably keep it in my backpack, bag, or basket because it is on the heavy side, but it is nice to have that option. It comes with a holder for you to keep it on your bike while in transit.

It reportedly scores an 8 out of 10 on the security scale and both sides engage when you lock it up. It certainly feels solid, and I doubt any potential thief would take the time to try to crack it open. No cable is included, but it ships with two keys, so be sure to keep them safe. The locking mechanism doesn't snap, so you need to turn the key to engage it, but that is a small quibble. The entire bottom comes off for more versatile use. Overall, I'm pleased with the Abus 410 and would get it again.

25105,2921,3960,"I just received this today.  I love chili but mostly eat it in the fall and winter months.  I decided to open it and try it out.  My first impression was it is not all that great as is right out of the package.  It does not have really any flavor and it did not taste like any chili I ever had.  Where is the meat, the tomatoes and, hot spices!  But, after I thought about it a little while I realized.  This would be a good base to make your own chili from.  Everyone has different taste when it comes to chili.  Some like it spicy hot and some do not.  Then there are the different meats or meat substitutes people use.  So whether your a meat lover or vegetarian, this is a great base to start your own chili from.  Just add whatever meats, spices and, other ingredients you want in your chilli.  This product is actually very versatile and can be used by anyone.  Some of you may like it right out of the can and some of you won't, like me.  I need meat in my chili.  Also I like my chili a little more spicy so it will clear my nose after being outside in the cold.  I like my chili to have tomatoes and tomato sauce in it as well.  I was going to give this 2 or 3 stars but after much thought I have decided on a 4 star rating for now. I gave it this rating because I see potential.  Yes, some people will like it the way it is but, I'm not one of those people.  I will make my next batch my way using this as a base and then update this review.
As for you backpackers out there, if you like this as is then just bring the water you need.  Some hikers like bringing things to cook that are quick and simple. For those of you that need more in your chili and don't mind, just prepare it before your hike.  Then put it in a heavy duty Ziploc bag.  Being cooked already should help it last longer in your pack as well but don't wait to long.  I see this product being used more by the home pepper then the backpacker because of prep and time.  Not that it can not be done.  Augason also makes many other products like onions, tomatoes, meats and substitutes, cheese, and so on.  It just depends on how much you want to carry just to have this chili as a meal.",1531267200,4,receiv today love chili mostli eat fall winter month decid open tri first impress great right packag realli flavor tast like chili ever meat tomato hot spice thought littl realiz would good base make chili everyon differ tast come chili like spici hot differ meat meat substitut peopl use whether meat lover vegetarian great base start chili add whatev meat spice ingredi want chilli product actual versatil use anyon may like right wont like need meat chili also like chili littl spici clear nose outsid cold like chili tomato tomato sauc well go give 2 3 star much thought decid 4 star rate gave rate see potenti ye peopl like way im one peopl make next batch way use base updat review backpack

25221,6475,1629,"I've been a serious rider for over 30 years and the most important part of the bike is the seat - it can literally affect whether you enjoy the ride or not. Finding the right seat is not easy, everyone is different, I've tried many. How far you ride, how long, riding position, your sit bones, the shape and size of every part of your body, etc can all affect what you need in a seat. You have to try them. Over the years you find what style works best for you. I prefer a narrow, round seat that is stiff but with some padding.

Brooks may be the best bike seat as far as quality. I've had a leather Brooks seat on one of my bikes for years. The only problem is they are hard and like this one usually have little or no padding. I tried this one for about 15 miles and while I like the shape it started to get uncomfortable.  I ride a minimum of 30 miles so either it's time for new padded shorts or I'll need to get a cushion cover on it. It usually takes a few adjustments to get it right as well. The seat itself is a hard rubber. Usually with Brooks seats they get better over time, too, as you work them in.

Overall, a top quality well-made seat from Brooks that looks great too.",1531440000,5,ive seriou rider 30 year import part bike seat liter affect whether enjoy ride find right seat easi everyon differ ive tri mani far ride long ride posit sit bone shape size everi part bodi etc affect need seat tri year find style work best prefer narrow round seat stiff pad brook may best bike seat far qualiti ive leather brook seat one bike year problem hard like one usual littl pad tri one 15 mile like shape start get uncomfort ride minimum 30 mile either time new pad short ill need get cushion cover usual take adjust get right well seat hard rubber usual brook seat get better time work overal top qualiti wellmad seat brook look great

3. Widespread dishonesty/pay-to-review arrangements (I haven't looked for evidence of this, but I have seen other unrelated products fall victim to this).

They are a nice lightweight summer style of glove. I was pleasantly surprised by the pull loops as I thought they looked weird and would get in the way, but they don't.

Con: My only con for these is that they are not as grippy/tacky as I would hope given the summer humid/sweaty conditions they are used in. I got the black and white pair, and if you look at the palm it looks kindof like small cells or pebbles. The slightly darker lines between them are tacky/grippy but not very grippy.

Any time I get home from work, I like to throw on some gloves and hit the bag until I really break a sweat, then walk my dog as my wife finished dinner.  It's as awesome a ritual as it sounds and this kind of activity might not be an MMA exercise routine, but it's fun and healthy.  I have a stressful job with a stressful commute, but the routine has me feeling great.

These gloves are light, easy to toss on and secure with the velcro, and the padding absorbs plenty of impact on the heavy bag.  The velcro aspect provides good wrist support.  I know my technique is probably not perfect and I have no coach around to help me with that, so I need to be careful.  I also wrap my hands.

If you're actually boxing, you need more expensive, much more substantial gloves.  If you're hitting the heavy bag for a really serious workout, you need more substantial gloves costing maybe double what these do.  But these are a great beginner set that have held up for me in daily use.  I really encourage men and women who need to relieve stress from their days to incorporate something action oriented into their fitness routine.  For us, these gloves are ideal.  If you wear them out, maybe it's time to upgrade your equipment or even take your interest to a boxing gym, but for most people, that will never need to happen and investing in overkill equipment can put off just getting started.

25502,1350,4488,"These are very light faux-leather boxing gloves.

If you're looking at this, you are probably not a serious boxer, so let me be blunt: these are great for beginners and most people won't get beyond that.  You can get better gloves for a bit more than double the price that are better for actual boxing or for a big muscular guy beating the hell out of a heavy bag.  If you're just starting, these will do for quite a while.

When I get done with my daily commute home, I like to punch a heavy bag until I'm out of breath, then I take the dog for a walk while my wife plates up a nice dinner.  Every day I do this I feel much more relaxed.  There's just something visceral and stress relieving about it, but I'm not a professional boxer and my technique is from mimicking youtube.  It's important that I avoid injury, so I wrap my hands and I wear some cheap gloves.  These gloves are cheaper than the ones I bought, but they are actually nicer.  They are great for stabilizing my wrist, which is where I think I'd be most prone to an injury, and because I'm exercising this joint, I'm strengthening it over time.

The huge velcro straps are easy to put on, even when gloved.  They don't get super tight and they don't need to.  The gloves aren't moving around when they are on, and have enough room to kinda help take impact.  The fake leather is durable and the whole glove is lightweight.  I'm sure these would be destroyed in time, but that's what happens to sports equipment.

These are the BG15, and have a light foam pad.  The BG16 have a gel pad and are superior for only a few more dollars.  I think the BG15 are fine if you have low upper body strength, but you definitely want to wrap your hands.  I'd recommend the BG16 as the better value (I own both).  I do not recommend spending more than twice as much on gloves if you're just punching a bag for a light workout.  If you tear these up, that's a good indication you do need to upgrade, but most won't.  Also, I wouldn't use these for sparring, but they are nice for a reflex bag (yes you should glove up for a reflex bag).  Ringside makes a great reflex bag by the way.

At any rate, that's my impression.  Don't let the premium price of the nicest stuff be a barrier to getting into a great sport and daily stress relief mechanism!  But if you are a serious athlete, you'll want to spend the extra money for a nicer set.",1531785600,4,light fauxleath box glove your look probabl seriou boxer let blunt great beginn peopl wont get beyond get better glove bit doubl price better actual box big muscular guy beat hell heavi bag your start quit get done daili commut home like punch heavi bag im breath take dog walk wife plate nice dinner everi day feel much relax there someth viscer stress reliev im profession boxer techniqu mimick youtub import avoid injuri wrap hand wear cheap glove glove cheaper one bought actual nicer great stabil wrist think id prone injuri im exercis joint im strengthen time huge velcro strap easi put even glove dont get super tight dont need glove arent move around enough room kinda help take impact fake leather durabl whole glove lightweight im sure would destroy time that happen sport equip bg15 light foam pad bg16 gel pad superior

Seemed to work well and held its zero, but that is only one shooting session of maybe 50-75 rounds. I decided its just a little too big for my Marlin carbines. I'll probably end up trying it on an AR I built, since its height and length won't be the issue it is on smaller carbines.

It's a huge business over there and there are a couple top sellers that have really Bohemian style headbands and are quite popular.  After buying a second one from the same seller though, I was sent the wrong color and she refused to refund me.  And this is what sometimes happens when you go to independent marketplaces like Etsy, people are uncooperative.

So I decided to come look over on Amazon for my next headband.  I was really blown away by the style of these.  They are very versatile, attractive, and modern/expensive looking.  It's also quite a bit cheaper than the bands I got on Etsy.  (by a few bucks).  Turns out I wish I started here in the first place.  These bands are very high quality and I love how you can change the look so easily.  They are also very strong - the ones I got from the independent seller were very comfy but became loosened rather quickly.  These aren't like this.

25585,2130,3991,"I replaced a set of Extra Chunky grips with these and was a) surprised at the large increase in hand comfort and feel, versus the small based on measurement) size increase and b) completely surprised at how much easier they were to install versus Extra Chunky grips, which I have on all of my bikes.  Over time I'll replace them all with Wolf Tooth Fat Paw grips.

The Wolf Tooth grips don't measure to be much larger in terms of physical size.  Wolf Tooth says 36-37mm installed diameter, whereas ESI's Extra Chunky grips are advertised as 34mm.  I haven't broken out the calipers (yet) but somebody is fibbing.  The Wolf Tooth grips feel significantly larger and more comfortable.  Worth noting is I wear Size L gloves, typically.

The benefit I didn't expect but which I think was worth perhaps more than the more better grip size was the ease of installation.  If you have installed The Other Leading Brand grips before, you know what I mean.  I have tried both the dish soap method (don't go there) and alcohol and the results range from just being very difficult to desperately difficult.  You'll make it work but chances are you will go thru a lot of drama to get there.  The Fat Paw grips on the other hand were quite a shock.  They *felt* like they would be as tough of a job as I expected given their rigidity and increased thickness.  Not true!  I did the usual alcohol bath inside and onto the bar, pressed on and got ready for the usual fight and ... poof done already!  What?  I thought I had another 5 minutes of cursing and grunting... Nope about 10 seconds and done.  I bet I can even get them back off again without having to cut them off, which is the usual story with The Other Leading Brand.

Here's a top tip:  these grips are of course made of silicone.  I spiral-wrap these grips using only gentle pressure with silicone self-fusing tape, many brands and colors of which are available here on Amazon.  The spiral wrap pattern is exactly like you would wrap traditional ram-horn road bike handlebars.  the self-fusing silicone tape fuses to the grips so it never comes off or moves.  Also in short order it wears relatively smooth but still retains enough inherent stickiness to be a perfect grip tape.  It also becomes a protective layer over the grip, and if you ever manage to cut up the grip tape, you just wrap on another layer in the opposite direction and boom... your grips are protected and like new again.",1531958400,5,replac set extra chunki grip surpris larg increas hand comfort feel versu small base measur size increas b complet surpris much easier instal versu extra chunki grip bike time ill replac wolf tooth fat paw grip wolf tooth grip dont measur much larger term physic size wolf tooth say 3637mm instal diamet wherea esi extra chunki grip advertis 34mm havent broken calip yet somebodi fib wolf tooth grip feel significantli larger comfort worth note wear size l glove typic benefit didnt expect think worth perhap better grip size ea instal instal lead brand grip know mean tri dish soap method dont go alcohol result rang difficult desper difficult youll make work chanc go thru lot drama get fat paw grip hand quit shock felt like would tough job expect given rigid increas thick true usual alcohol bath insid onto bar press got readi usual fight poof done alreadi thought anoth 5 minut cur grunt nope 10 second done bet even get back without cut

I was especially impressed at how many different adjustments you could make to get the fit exactly right. The main straps are attached to padding which are on guides that can be adjusted up and down. That makes it very versatile to fit any frame. There are plenty of pockets in thoughtful locations. I also really like the Versaclip system, which lets you clip different pocket attachments on the hip belt.

The top of the pack completely detaches and converts to a smaller sling pack, designed for summit hikes, but I've also used just that part on short hikes around town - so it's almost like two packs in one. It also comes with a rain cover in a dedicated pouch that's easy to get to if you get caught in a sudden downpour. The main compartment conveniently has a full U zipper that runs pretty much the entire length, making it easy to get to stuff packed in the bottom and also makes it easy to load up.

While I haven't fully put it through its paces yet, it does seem well constructed and durable. If it is like any other Thule backpack, it will last a long time and worth the investment.

25718,5922,2674,"Of all crazy things---I was fishing with this and nothing, nothing, nothing, and was getting ready to try something different.  So I had tossed it out and got distracted by my wife needing help with some issue in the boat, and so I set my pole down.  I went to go back to it and wind this back, and i couldn't see it anywhere.  I thought for a second it had floated under the boat or ??  i just didn't know, so I pulled on the line and found out why- I had the fight of my life on my hands.  I was using 40lb braid- primarily because that was what was on the baitcaster and- I didn't want to lose this thing when I was casting it- so what came with the duck?  How about a 15lb channel catfish.  It apparently had seen this thing sitting there and quietly cruised up and just ate it.  Then, he went back down under his tree or whatever place he lives and sat waiting for another opportunity.  I of course spoiled the party when I wanted my duck lure back and winded it in.

That was the one and only time I used it, and that result was very impressive.  I do not know how well these would work or not work with bass or pike or whatever, but on that day, it worked flawlessly on a big channel catfish.  Even though this duck got almost swallowed, it still is in good condition, I had some work to dig it out, and at the same time save the fish who went back into the depths to do this again some day.  What saved the fish was the hooks are tight against the ducks body.  when I started retrieving the duck, the hook caught the catfish in the lip.  I think this could be an issue with bass- and you might want to attach a ""Stinger"" hook- a trailing hook- because these hooks are going to take a beast of a hookset to do the job.

The lure did its job, I have to give it 5 stars.  One thing, make sure you have some hefty test line and a strong rod- because this thing flies when you cast it.

25746,5937,2208,"As a shooter returning to sidearms after a long time away... the state of the art since my last pistol (H&K USP Compact, back mid-90s) is astounding. Much like the AR, firearms & firearms tech have gotten scary good in the 25 yrs since dialup modems...

That said, my Sig P320 is a very good pistol, nabbed for a good price. But I'd no idea of the capability in it locked away from me, until getting this Mantis X system.

For a middle-age enthusiast... a lot of years I could've owned and developed muscle memory and experience, esp for a striker-fired pistol... are just irretrievable.  Starting from square 1.09 has been... humbling (also have some considerable hand, arm, and finger injuries from riding streetbikes and wrenching since that USP Compact, that also put the goalposts further away). The only way to catch up IME for a guy like me, is this Mantis X sensor pod.

Not sure if systems like this will become more common soon with more manufacturers getting involved... but it tells you everything, EVERYTHING you're not doing right before, during, and after the shot. It can pick up your bore movement as if you have a laser boresighter IN REAL TIME, so you can see how your execution of fundamentals is affecting your POI -- and best of all, you can use it with dry-fire. This system costs exactly one 4-hr range session of 124-gr 9mm ball ammo for me -- so while not at all cheap, it'll pay for itself with two sessions of dry-fire training.

Convinced yet? Now you can switch modes to live fire, and critique yourself at the range, your own personal firearms instructor. And when not used, it can come off your rail or mag baseplate in seconds.

I need to find the P320 baseplate, so I can use this with my IPSC rig and train holstered.

I like the better CTS-BD1 steel in this knife as compared to the 8cr steel on the budget Spyderco knives. The action is smooth (teflon washers I'm told), and the blade is centered perfectly. It's not a ""flipper"" knife, and the liner lock feels very secure. There are cut out liners (saves weight) on both sides of the knife grips for added strength, and there are screw holes for four pocket clip options. It's an open back design (my favorite), so you can see (and clean) everything easily.  The G10 handle scales are ""grippy"", but they are not aggressive enough to wear out your pockets.  There is a very usable finger choil on the back of the blade, which feels great for choking up on the knife for more finite tasks like brain surgery.  Update:  I've had this knife in my pocket non-stop for the last 2 weeks, and the edge has held up fine doing my normal EDC activities.  Also, no rust after hanging out in sweaty pockets all day long.

25927,7041,3593,"These go with the zman worms made to match these jig heads. They go well together.

I have been noticing a lot of other people using them so they work. Sadly, the fish are getting used to them.

A few things to keep in mind.  First, when a fish takes these, let her take it and set the hook with a very gentle raise of the rod almost like using circle hooks. The hooks are crazy sharp but are also very thin. They are not designed to be ripped through a fish's mouth. Setting hard usually just takes it right out of the mouth.

The other consideration is these are not weedless. Any thick algae or weeds will get ripped up by the hook. This makes it tough to feel a bite or just a salad being ripped from the bottom. The whole setup with the worm isn't heavy so it doesn't penetrate all weeds and can skim along the top but a weedless version, which they make, is needed for really weedy spots.

In the right place with a rocky or fairly clear bottom these work great and are something many fish have not seen. Like I said, they are good enough that the secret is no longer a secret.

25952,1932,4270,"I've relaxed in a hammock for the 1st time when we camp time this year.  So I wanted to get another one.  The Unigear was on a lightning deal and this brand has all the great specs: double size, high weight capacity, thick carabiner, suspension strap and included tree straps as my other hammock.  The color choices were limited on the deal, so I chose the gray/khaki color.  The color is very nice rich deep shiny gray and shimmery gold color in reality.  I'm very happy for the quality and color combination I chose.  I didn't opt for the flashy colors and higher price tag for those.  The bonus feature is on the bag, where an extra buckled nylon strap that's supposed to strap around the top of the drawstring bag.  Although while using the hammock the nylon straps hang down awkwardly and gets dirt on the buckles.  But the added function to help keep everything in the bag.  This is especially needed when re-stuffing the tree straps back into the bag.  A nice little feature to Unigear.  While the hammock's hanging, I just clasp the dangling strap and stuff it back into the bag, so it's out of the way.  I did notice that the tree straps are not as thick nor as heavy as what came with my other hammock and the stitching as a bit messy on the very important end loop.

26022,48,2057,"Daisy's POWERLINE 426 is a real winner.  I tested it by keeping CO2 cartridge in it for over a week and it held the gas with apparently no leakage.  I had put 70 -80 rounds through it and it still was thumping pretty hard, hard enough to drive BBs into the woodwork of an old shed.  This pistol has the easiest, shortest to pull trigger pull of all my airguns except the Makarov, much easier than the BR 45 and somewhat shorter and easier than the Umarex XBG and XCP (and TDP45).
With a safety that you can hear with a very distinctive audible snap when it is pressed it's easy to know when your gun is off or on safety.  It shows red on the left side when gun is ready to fire, a very safe weapon to operate.
I like airguns that are lightweight and the 426 only weighs 0.9 of a pound, very nice.
Length - 6.85"", Height - about 5&3/8"".
I shot an inch and a quarter 7 shot group from 20 feet with one flyer, not bad accuracy from such an inexpensive pistol.  3 of the shots are actually touching together.
It has enough power to drill right through those steel soup and bean cans.
Magazine is 15 rounds and fixed on top of gun so you can easily see how many BBs are left to fire.
If that jogger up in Michigan had had this airgun he would still be alive today!  He beat cancer only to die from those 2 large cane corso dogs that tore him apart!  Just a shot to their noses would have stopped the attacks. Always be ready with an airgun!
All in all I would give this pistol 5 stars for being so inexpensive, powerful,  accurate, dependable, lightweight, safe to operate.

Anyone who has been around the game will know that you can pay whatever you're willing for any aspect of the game.  There comes a time when value plays a role and golf balls really strike this cord.

The Titleist name has become the no doubt #1 ball in the game, but looking for a combination for soft feel and forgiveness, but still wanting consistency, resulted in a lengthy search that resulted in this ball.

From the tee to the green, even a high handicapper like myself could feel the forgiveness in this ball; compared to range balls the distance is noticble improved (read 5+ yards consistently...which adds up).

26082,997,4495,"I do enjoy disc golf.  My nephews do too.  We put this trough the ringer this past week, and here are the results:
-
In short, this is a cheap set meant for kids to see if they are interested in playing disc golf.  It's a lot of plastic, the discs aren't so great, and there are a couple things we didn't like about it.  Let's cut to the chase;
-
PROS:
+ Light.  Easy to setup.  Light enough to move from place to place.
+ Carrying bag.  Fits everything.  Easy to store it all when not in use.
+ Stands up OK.  Doesn't get knocked down by the discs when hitting it into the goal.
-
CONS:
- Plastic chains. I wish they were metal / heavier so the discs truly died when hitting them.
- Weak base.  The green pole at the base doesn't fit snugly into the base.  When moving this from place to place, it always comes out, and becomes a chore to move/reassemble.
- Loose flag.  We all joked at the start that the flag is barely held in place and we took bets when it would come out.  It did on the second round - a disc took it out.  No surprise to us.
- Weak discs. One had the text and graphics off center / messily applied.  All were misshapen.  Others more so the next day when left outside.  These are newb dics.
---
Despite it's faults, we had fun.  The weak base made it a pain to move from place to place, which we did after each ""hole"" to keep it interesting.  The discs don't fly true, but for kids, it's borderline acceptable.
---
In conclusion - this set is meant for little kids to see if they would be interested in disc golf.  I wouldn't buy this for older kids or adults.

26122,6118,2012,"Without a doubt one of the best deals on cheap scopes out there.  I mounted this on my Hatsan at 44 air rifle and this scope works perfect.  Mounts fit exactly as they should (the Hatsan has picatiny rails that accecpt both 11 and 20mm rings).  Scope bolted down perfectly.  Glass is nice and clear and crosshair is the perfect width for me.  Shooting air guns i like a thinner hair and this is exactly what I wanted.  The cross hair being etched into the glass makes it all the better, nice and sharp and precise.  Illumination is great but I rarely shoot in low light so not a feature I need often.  The included sun shade makes this scope enormous.  Well over a foot long (looks gigantic on my air rifle) but that doesnt bother me as I mostly shoot from a bench.  The eyecup adds a weird tunnel vision effect so Im not usjng it (plus it smells like harbor freight tools).  The flip up caps are ok but seem to want to come off when I try to flip them up.  My scopes windage dial was not tightened down when I got it. A couple turns with a 00 philips bit solved that.  Scope was easy to sight in and has held zero well.  Im only shooting out to about 30 yards so 20 power is all I manage.  At 20 power I can see the antennas on the ants that crawl on my targets.  The zoom works smooth and precise.  The rear focus ring is a bit looser than I like but it doesnt moove when shooting.  The front parralex adjustment works smoothly but the numbers are a bit off.  No big deal as the range numbers are really reference points not exacts.  Scope came well packed and quickly (thankz to ordering this on my wifes Prime).  While I don't think I would put this on a Springer for any other air gun this scope is an amzing amount of scope for a very reasonable price.

Other downsides: the sheath.  Overall, it is not bad. I have seen much worse. The sheath only covers the blade, which it should.

26387,1515,291,"Great in concept, but seriously wondering about the implementation. The original battery lasted just a short while. Didnt think much of it, and replaced it with a new fresh battery. I buy batteries from a known local vendor that turns their stock over rapidly, ensuring fresh batteries. The next battery lasted a couple of rides, dying within 4 days. Replaced it agin with known good batteries, and it lasted a couple rides more, before the third battery died. Was not, and still am not a happy camper. I appears that the sensor does not go to sleep, thereby draining the battery rapidly. Im forced to pull the battery from the unit after every ride, to avoid the battery dying prematurely. Ive gone two months like this, riding over 60 hours with no issues. That further reinforces that the unit doesnt go to sleep.

Outside of the battery issue, the unit works well. I use it on a dedicated bike mounted on a Wahoo Kickr trainer in my basement. These controlled conditions give me good, stable cadence values that are consistence with my known pedal cadence outside. It mounted easily and n the crank arm, and fortunately is easy enough to remove after every ride to keep the battery fresh.

If they issue a firmware update to fix when the unit goes to sleep to keep the battery from dying so quick, I would give this 5 stars.

26431,4057,2868,"Overall, I'm satisfied with the air rifle and would like to have working optics to go along with it.  My scope failed on the third shot fired -- reticle rotated 30 and no longer adjusted.  I have tried to contact GamoUSA (a.k.a. Daisy) with no success.  Gamo Spain did reply to my online form entry but referred me to the US office.  I have called the phone number during their advertised business hours and only received an outgoing message saying all of their representatives are busy, please call back later, click.

It's my opinion from reading reviews that the scope supplied with this (and other) Gamo air rifles has a quality control problem from their optics vendor.  It would be nice if Gamo would stand behind their branded products and offer a replacement for manufacturing defects that appear during first use.  Where is the 5 year warranty as advertised on the box?

Parting thoughts....
*  I bought from a big box store but should have purchased at Amazon for easier returns.  Maybe I would have gotten lucky with another scope on exchange.
*  I'm glad I bought the model with open sights for backup.  Otherwise I would be SOL.

I'll update this review when the situation change.

UPDATED 18AUG2018:
Increased rating from 3 to 4 stars.
While waiting for Gamo to respond I was able to exchange my failed scope at the big box store without any problems.  I left the scope off of the new rifle, using the open sights, until I heard back from Gamo.  They sent an email with additional scope installation instructions to remove the scope from the rings and to tighten the recoil retaining screw after mounting the rings only to the rifle.  There is a video on youtube from GamoOutdoor titled ""How To Correctly Mount A Scope On The Gamo Swarm Maxxim"" with more detail.  I did this with the first one and glad to see it is recommended but it wasn't specified in the printed instructions that came with the scope.
The only differences this time are that I took 50+ shots before mounting the scope and applied thread locker to all of the scope related screws.  Was it dieseling before?  Does thread lock do more than fixing the screws in place?  Did I just get lucky (so far) with the second scope?  All I know now is that I have a working combination now and have used it to remove two raccoons from my back yard in addition to some plinking with old water bottles.",1533254400,4,overal im satisfi air rifl would like work optic go along scope fail third shot fire reticl rotat 30 longer adjust tri contact gamousa aka daisi success gamo spain repli onlin form entri refer u offic call phone number advertis busi hour receiv outgo messag say repres busi plea call back later click opinion read review scope suppli gamo air rifl qualiti control problem optic vendor would nice gamo would stand behind brand product offer replac manufactur defect appear first use 5 year warranti advertis box part thought bought big box store purchas amazon easier return mayb would gotten lucki anoth scope exchang im glad bought model open sight backup otherwis would sol ill updat review situat chang updat 18aug2018 increas rate 3 4 star wait gamo respond abl exchang fail scope big box store without problem left scope new rifl use open sight heard back gamo sent email addit scope instal instruct remov scope ring tighten recoil retain screw mount ring rifl video youtub gamooutdoor titl correctli mount scope

26617,6118,2931,Just got these and set them up right away. So much fun to shoot these.  I set up a quick short (pistol) range in my side yard and blasted tbese with my  benjamin wildfire.  They are a lot harder to hit than I expected.  Shooting off hand it took my 11 shots to get all 4.  Im going to build a longer range for the rifles as I don't have a pistol to shot with.  The pistol distances will be good for my granddaughter to hone her skills on.  These are well made and I suspect they will stand up to years of abuse.  I like the hole in the base so these can be tied off (the chicken took a coue minutes to find in the grass despite the yellow color).  Im going to order more of these as we get our range built.

Couldn't fit 1 gallon paint can into it.. maybe  w heat and force it could make it'

Additional comments:
1.  Water proof - as long as top is rolled up tight and clipped off right
2.  Off-gas: Many people comment about smell. Bag should let vinyl off-gas a couple weeks before use.
3.  Off-gas: Ancillary use of bag (aka vinyl shower curtains) in the trunk of your car (to give it that new car smell)
4. This bag is the right size for a purse, camera, towel and change of shorts and shirt.
5. Rolled up/clipped off and water proof tight this 10 Liter bag will not hold 10 Liters only about 6L

Conclusion:  Seems like one company in China makes most of these bags and then companies like ""Unigear"" stamp their name on them, so i just price/Prime shopped this bag and was happy enough to have it bouncing around in the hull of a boat while we went snorkeling.

Serfas Cruiser Saddle for Women: A heavy seat, and painful for tailbones after 6 minutes, though the gel seemed nice in the store.

Selle Royal Moderate Bike Saddle for Women: Beautiful looking, light weight, and soft to the touch, but ultimately still painful after 15 minutes.

Sunlite Bicycle Cloud 9 Suspension Comfort Gel Cruiser: So heavy with visible steel springs that I could never get it to stop shifting up/down-back/forth on the post no matter how tight the bolts were made. (That one was recommended by a reviewer on the exercise bike site.)

And then there was Bikeroo. Soft, mid-weight, came with it's own, pre-mounted attachment pieces that tightened perfectly, stays put, and the comfort is perfect for me. Not even minor pain after 30 minutes straight. Plus, it's good looking as well. Solid construction and sewing, too.

This does cause the grips to rub against each other when putting into the bag. On a riding cart this wouldn't be a problem.

26769,6044,1629,"The Brooks Cambium C17 All Weather City/Touring Bicycle Saddle is waterproof and weatherproof.  The seat is made of a  fiberglass reinforced back plate and weights 450 g.

PROS:
The seat is virtually waterproof and weatherproof, and is not subject to tearing.
The shape is reall ergonomic...I like the slender front portion of the seat.

CONS (IMHO):
The seat is very tacky (almost sticky).
Due to the seat's tackiness, your shorts get stuck as you slide off the seat.
Lack of padding.  This is the least comfortable bicycle seat I've every used.  It has no padding, but the fiberglass construction does give the seat a little bit of flex.  If worn with padded bicycle shorts, it would be ok for my bony behind.
Base - I'm used to picking up and rotating my bike by the edge of the seat.  This seat is only reinforced at the locations where the five round circles are located (attachment points).  I don't think this seat would hold up to bearing the weight of the bike when grabbed by the side.

CONCLUSION:  If you need an all-weather seat, use padded shorts, and maybe have a more padded behind, this seat might be for you.  If would be fine for short rides, but for 2+ miles, it's a bit tiring for me.

We even moved this to our front door, using the foyer  / entry hallway as corridor walls to limit the extreme distance of the richochet shots, and still measured ourselves spending nearly 17 hours chasing down balls for every 2 seconds of actual basket shot attempts.

In fact, attempts to bounce the ball off the backboard to assist shots kept resulting in the basketball somehow being catapaulted higher and further away than the actual shot attempt, endangering the foyer chandelier hanging 18ft above.

I was impressed.  Took a little time to get it dialed in but once it was settled, it was fantastic.  On the fixed it felt better than the Brooks B17, that was probably more due to the 17 having a slight nose up attitude versus the Cambi sitting level.  I found the C19 to be just a comfortable on a Pugsley though.

If you've ridden the leather variants, you'll notice the difference.  The fact that there is a difference isn't indicative of anything lacking or undesirable, saddles are a very personal preference.

It looks like they made a placket to hide the front of zipper but it doesn't work, so you have this odd bit of material at the very top of the zipper. This can be machine washed on a cold cycle, dried on a low, gentle cycle and a light iron, if needed. Do not dry clean. One more thing - at the top of the windbreaker, where it is sewn by the shoulders, is an opening on both sides. I have no idea what these are for.

26825,2809,4531,"I purchased this bag for a month long trip in Asia after reading a ton of reviews about how great it was.  I got the eagle creek 3 pack organizers to add to it as well.  If I could do it over again, I'd either get a bigger version of the pack, or just use regular luggage all together.  Truth of the matter is, most of the Asian airlines let you check a free bag, and it's not worth it to me to lug around 20 pounds in a backpack just to be minimal.  The bag got pretty heavy and you'll definitely want to use the hip strap, or your back will hurt.  It's not big enough for you to travel abroad and buy new clothes or shoes and add to the bag.  I had to get some extra clothes and a pair of loafers, and it was overkill.  It made me wish that I had purchased the 55L or even the 70L.

I packed extra clothes because I wasn't sure how often I'd get to do laundry.  Some of the hotels we stayed at were super expensive to do laundry.  Do you really want to spend your holiday time doing laundry?  I wanted to minimize that so we could relax and enjoy the trip.  I'm keeping the bag because it's perfect for a weekend trip, or if you have easy access to laundry.  A weekend ski trip, or going home for the holidays, it's perfect.  On our next trip I plan to bring a checked bag and use this backpack as an addition.

It's great quality, and I'd recommend it.  Just be aware of the size and length of your trip etc.  Enjoy!",1533945600,3,purchas bag month long trip asia read ton review great got eagl creek 3 pack organ add well could id either get bigger version pack use regular luggag togeth truth matter asian airlin let check free bag worth lug around 20 pound backpack minim bag got pretti heavi youll definit want use hip strap back hurt big enough travel abroad buy new cloth shoe add bag get extra cloth pair loafer overkil made wish purchas 55l even 70l pack extra cloth wasnt sure often id get laundri hotel stay super expens laundri realli want spend holiday time laundri want minim could relax enjoy trip im keep bag perfect weekend trip easi access laundri weekend ski trip go home holiday perfect next trip plan bring check bag use backpack addit great qualiti id recommend awar size length trip etc enjoy

 when I took it out, I was not nice to it. if it cannot handle being thrown around a little, then I don't want it.

Pro's: the magnum field pod is great for a multitude of set-ups, whether that be an assistant to a seated position, standing, kneeling, what have you.
for the most part, it hold the rifle dead still (and I am using a twelve pound rifle) and is easy to adjust in order to balance everything.
the legs are extremely adjustable, allowing last minute adjustments to cant, tilt, or level.
cons: its big and its heavy. its not something I would personally use as a hunter unless you 4x4 that sucker to your spot and set up. (shootin' sticks for the on foot huntsman)
the forward and backward ""rocker"" adjustment does not get tight enough in my opinion. its enough to hold the rifle, but It should have some level of resistance to my physical input, instead it only takes a slight amount of pressure on the rear of the rifle to tilt it to and fro. even on lighter rifles, this is still a problem. because of this, I am forced out of my comfort zone and shoot awkwardly, (although efficiently) with all of my support hand and manipulation on the center of the rifle versus the toe which is standard practice for any kind of ELR. maybe it is just me who knows, that's why I am keeping it at five stars.

Zippers were large, worked well and are able to be locked (as noted in a picture). Going over the compartments each were well constructed with the front and back ones having compartments for magazines and a padded envelope to hold a pistol. The envelopes are big enough to hold my G17 so they can fit some full size pistols. It your pistol does not fit then just simple use the envelope as a divider to keep your pistol padded.

The center compartment comes with two Velcro dividers and allowed you to customize the compartment a little. I was able to fit my hearing protection, glasses, 500 rounds of 9mm, Uplula loaded and a few other miscellaneous items. The bag also came with a shoulder strap and the clips are metal.

There was no Gel that I could find, just foam.  I assume they mean Gel Foam since I couldn't find the layer of gel.

I used thes on the RAGBRAI ride across Iowa....about 475 miles total for the week ride.  Around 6 hours of riding a day.
While they did work, it was so bothersome to have the pad shifting around all of the time.  They are also quite lumpy!  The foam just squishes down and the thicker parts are lumpy under your butt.  Chamois butter doesn't help that!

I assume that if I had a size smaller, they may have stayed put better.  I wore them under a pair of ""basketball shorts"" which are loose fitting.  When compared to an actual pair of biking shorts, they SUCK!  The bike shorts are great, stay put, and aren't lumpy under your butt.

Almost every method typically used to ignite tinder to start and slowly build to a campfire, to warm a person, cook a meal, provide signaling smoke during the day or signaling light in the dark, provide some light and create a deterrent to keep wild animals a safe distance away, has an inherently fatal flaw that must be recognized.  Wood or Paper Stick Matches can be lost, get wet or be completely used (leaving an empty storage container), the special striker strips needed to ignite Waterproof Matches can be lost or completely scratched out, fluid or gas-fueled Lighters can blow out in gusty or high winds, run out of lighter or butane fuel, flints and piezo-electric igniters can break, wear down, or wear out, 9-volt Batteries (used to ignite 0000 steel wool) can become completely discharged or corroded over time, and a Bow Drill requires skill, patience, practice, two hands (more than two hands it seems, sometimes!), and a good bit of time, dry weather and not too much wind.

The one fire-starting tool that won't fall victim to these previously noted failures (it has a 550-paracord neck lanyard you can slip over your head to avoid losing it!) is the best Ferrocerium Rod and Steel Striker Fire Steel I've ever used.  That fire steel is the Uberleben Zunden Bushcraft Fire Steel with Wood Handle and Neck Lanyard, which is sold in three different sizes. with  ferrocerium rod diameters of 5/16"" (The Traditional), 3/8"" (The Pro), and 1/2"" (The Fatty).  At a length of nearly 5"" (including the ferrocerium rod and tapered wooden handle flattened on two opposing sides to make it easy to hold), the Uberleben Zunden Bushcraft Fire Steel and it's 6-in-1 mult-tool (map scale, concave-serrated tinder scraper, straight-edge spine, hex wrench, ruler & bottle opener) steel scraper will provide an impressive shower of sparks that ignited every type of tinder material or fire starter tab I tested with it.  The seller/manufacturer says each Uberleben Zunden Fire Steel will provide 12,000 - 20,000 strikes. ( I will take their word for that performance number.  I doubt that my old wrists, forearms and shoulders still have 12,000 - 20,000 strikes left in them in this lifetime.  I'll leave that testing to you younger, lower mileage guys!)

The tapered wooden handle, with a 550-paracord neck lanyard keeping the 6-in-1 steel striker attached to it, permits the user to have a comfortable, stable and secure grip on the fire steel, allowing the user to hold the steel striker steady and control its position, just above the tinder nest / bundle, and quickly pull the fire steel upward to put the highest number of sparks directly onto the tinder nest / bundle, getting the tinder nest / bundle to catch fire and start burning well, ready to accept small kindling materials, which when that begins to burn well and build some heat, allow slightly larger kindling to be slowly added, followed by small firewood after it is burning well, and finally, adding large firewood over a good base of hot, red coals and a good, warming campfire.  You now have the 2nd most important need to maintaining life in the wilderness taken care of quite nicely!

I own five Uberleben Zunden Bushcraft Fire Steels with Wooden Handles, keeping one on the leather sheath of each of my small, large, and Mongo-size bushcraft / survival knives because one or two of them will ALWAYS be hung on the back and side of my belt before I head out into the wilderness (or just go to my campsite).  Each of them are made from top quality materials, assembled with excellent craftsmanship, and provide me with a survival tool I can depend on to preserve my life, and the lives of the people accompanying me.  As I mentioned previously, the wooden handle is very comfortable for me to hold, gives me a secure hold on the ferrocerium rod, and, being sanded smoothly, but not finished, its handle permits me to apply a wipe-on wood stain to it in a shade that nicely complements the color of the leather knife sheath and the handle scales of the knife in the sheath.  (Nothing says you can't look good while using your bushcraft skills, according to my wife.  And we all know a happy wife makes for a happy life!))

It is important to note that the black coating material found on ALL ferrocerium rods MUST be scraped off COMPLETELY to obtain the maximum spark-generating performance of ALL these rods.  (Otherwise, you'll have as much luck getting the rod to spark as you would have trying to start a lawnmower engine with an empty, dry, gas tank.)",1534377600,5,fire 2nd import need maintain life right behind shelter import need maintain life abl start fire primari import almost everi method typic use ignit tinder start slowli build campfir warm person cook meal provid signal smoke day signal light dark provid light creat deterr keep wild anim safe distanc away inher fatal flaw must recogn wood paper stick match lost get wet complet use leav empti storag contain special striker strip need ignit waterproof match lost complet scratch fluid gasfuel lighter blow gusti high wind run lighter butan fuel flint piezoelectr ignit break wear wear 9volt batteri use ignit 0000 steel wool becom complet discharg corrod time bow drill requir skill patienc practic two hand two hand seem sometim good bit time dri weather much wind one firestart tool wont fall victim previous note failur 550paracord neck lanyard slip head avoid lose best ferrocerium rod steel striker fire steel ive ever use fire steel uberleben zunden bushcraft fire steel wood handl neck lanyard sold three differ size ferrocerium rod diamet 516 tradit 38 pro 12 fatti length nearli 5 includ ferrocerium rod taper wooden handl flatten two

2. Kind of related to item 1, the wide feet, which don't let it sink into the sand or soft ground, have to be taken off the legs in order for it to fit in the provided bag. This makes it kind of a hassle for a beach chair.

3. The seating position is more upright than I was expecting. in the chair like this. When it's close to the ground, I want to be leaning back just a little bit so the wait is not all on my butt. But this chair is actually pretty upright.

When I play, and I get kicked in the front, I don't feel a thing except some pressure.

I definitely like that it gives me better visibility into my activity levels.

cons: that said, i find it to be a bit inaccurate, most especially in the sleep monitor.  It's usually off by at least an hour - it usually says i've gone to bed at least an hour later than i actually have. it also doesn't accurately track the frequency with which i wake up. it seems to think that me fending off the cat for 5 minutes is just ""light sleep"" and one time it didn't even register that i'd gotten up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. soooooo that feature pretty much sucks.  also, the alarms don't work as well as they ought. the evening one usually goes off but the morning one has yet to do so. the app for managing it is a bit odd too. not the worst, not the best. Another source of frustration is that when i'd initially purchased this thing, it clearly stated that it was waterproof and that i could swim with it. when it arrived, it was advising not to even shower with it!!!! ugh. i wanted something i could swim with as much of my fitness activity is water based. so i've showered with it and that seems to be ok. i kayaked with it and that was ok. i rafted with it and that wasn't so ok. got some moisture inside. it had all dried out within a week so it wasn't the end of the world. i guess you get what you pay for, so this thing is not bad for $30.  when this band eventually dies, i will probably invest in a higher end, water-resistant to 10m spec device.",1534809600,3,pro thing amaz forc pay much closer attent activ level influenc get move around frequent purchas way see itd worth invest money higher end brand name fit tracker definit like give better visibl activ level con said find bit inaccur especi sleep monitor usual least hour usual say ive gone bed least hour later actual also doesnt accur track frequenc wake seem think fend cat 5 minut light sleep one time didnt even regist id gotten middl night go bathroom soooooo featur pretti much suck also alarm dont work well ought even one usual goe morn one yet app manag bit odd worst best anoth sourc frustrat id initi purchas thing clearli state waterproof could swim arriv advis even shower ugh want someth could swim much fit activ water base ive shower seem ok kayak ok raft wasnt ok got moistur insid

Also, these are very light. Again, these will work for me when fishing but I'm not sure they would hold up with daily use.

Mine came with a hard case which was very nice because I can just keep these in my tackle backpack and use them when I need them. They will hold up better that way so I appreciate that.

Finally, I honestly have not used polarized glasses before to compare these. These did eliminate some glare. I couldn't see through the water like magic but the day I tried them it was totally clear and the sun was shining off the water directly in my face. I will never face sunny conditions worse so these definitely made it better.

27171,7321,940,"I bought this combo pack with the waistband clip and the silicone wrist bracelet holder for the Fitbit One.  My previous waistband clips were OEM from Fitbit, and like so many of us have experienced, the plastic cap of the rear holder broke off after about a year of use.  Plus, the sleep wristband was flimsy and after a few weeks use, the Fitbit would fall out during the evening.

Thus far, I have only used the wrist bracelet.  It's comfortable, and I didn't notice it while sleeping.  Best advantage is that since it holds the One firmly against the wrist, I felt it vibrate when the alarm went off this morning.  My wife is a sensitive sleeper and gets out of bed much later than me, so having a silent alarm that doesn't disturb her is my primary motivation for the purchase.

The reticle lights up with a red LED when it's turned on, which is good for finding the reticle when you're after that pesky skunk who is stinking up the neighborhood.

27397,6460,2803,"As the headline states, overall it's a very good product. Build quality appears to be pretty good. Everything fits and functions. The gauge seems to be accurate. The valve head / hose comes with a little o-ring on it to seal, though I still added some teflon tape the the threads. The valve head works very well to grip and hold both schrader and presta valves when putting air / pressure into tires.

My only issue came with trying to seat a few tubeless tire beads on wheels using a presta valve. A presta valve is external to the valve stem...threads onto the top. When you remove this to get higher volume flow to seat a tire bead you are removing what the inflator heads wants / needs to grip onto. Without it the inflator head likes to pop off the valve stem once you start to build any reasonable pressure in the tire. With the valve installed you can't get enough air flow. I had to resort to using an blow gun which had a silicone tip that would fit over the presta valve and seal. This allowed high enough air flow to seat the tires. This wasn't an issue with schrader equipped wheels as the valve is internal to the valve stem. You can remove the valve core and the head on the inflator still has 100% of the valve stem to grip and hold.

I'm still very happy with it.

27441,278,2210,"So I have put probably 270 road miles and a mix of dirt, gravel, and single track of about 150 miles on this bag. It has done very well. The durability is great. I usually load each side up with a liter or two of water and camping gear, and then I load the top with a ton of water and heavier gear.

Weighs in at 970 grams for the sides and 230 grams for the top (with a little trail dirt on them)

As far as water resistance.... I cant say for sure for an actual ride... But I feel it would fend of a sprinkle for an hour. However, I threw it in the shower for about 7 minutes and it was pretty soaked inside. Granted, a shower is the equivalent of a heavy rain storm.  I personally will only use this on sunny days and dry non heavy dew climates.

This is a great touring and even bikepacking set up. I would recommend these for a beginner or an experience rider looking for throw away bag. Though I have moved on to more specialized bags, I will continue to use these when I know the weather will be good. There is still a lot of use in these.

Pros:
Durability. Has handled some rough single track
Holds off water (spilled 20 oz of water inside the side pouch and it took forever for it to leak out through the material)
Fits most racks with side rails
Cons:
Not water proof
Top bag will shift a lot unless secured

27442,6428,375,"I'm writing this review after having had these for maybe two months now. I usually like to wait awhile to write reviews, occasionally I will write one after a short time, like this for instance.  I feel confident writing this review after such a short time because I've used these for everything I've intended to use them for.  So as of right now (9/9/18) this is a performance based review, if any physical/electrical problems arise I'll update. Things will wear out and need to be replaced from time to time, if these wear out from normal use I'm not going to gripe in a review about it, if something goes wrong that shouldn't, I'll add it to my review.

So anyways, I bought these for shooting. I got tired of ear plugs in, ear plugs out, repeat.  I got tired of shouting while wearing earplugs, and not hearing conversations that weren't shouted.  So after a little amazon research, I settled on these. It was between these and the honeywell's. I went with the walkers because the honeywell's 14,000 reviews just seemed a little fishy to me.

So these show up at my house. I take them out of the packaging, put some batteries in, pretty simple, put on and turn them on. I had never used any type of sound amplifying technology before. It is pretty cool. I step outside my garage and I can hear birds chirping all over the place.  Cool.  I go back inside to give the hearing protection aspect part of these a try.  I leave them turned on and fire up the table saw,  pretty much instant cut out of the speakers inside them.  So for garage applications, mainly woodworking, these are great. Comfortable to wear, protect my hearing quite well. The headphone jack is great, my garage has a metal roof, so when it rains, it's super loud. I was out there today with the muffs on and music playing through them l, couldn't hear the rain, it was perfect.

I use them for lawn mowing, playing music through them is again great!

So they're great for lawn mowing, leaf blowing, woodworking, and garage time when it's raining.  But, I bought these mainly for shooting.

So I've taken these out shooting twice. I have shot with these and listened to others shooting.  The sound amplification feature is a game changer. I can hear people talking without them having to shout. I can hear what's going on on the firing line without having to be right next to it.  When the shooting starts, the speaker cuts out just long enough to muffle the initial clap of the gun, but comes back in quick enough to hear the echo of the shot.  Rapid fire shooting isn't a problem with it cutting in and out quickly, it cancels out loud noise regardless of how fast it comes and how much of a pause is in between each shot.  I listened to others shooting mainly handguns and .223 caliber ARs.  More than enough hearing protection for these calibers.  When I started to shoot, i started with a 9mm handgun. Plenty of hearing protection, and with the sound amplification, I could hear my friends talking crap behind me, defenitely a nice feature.  I progressed to an AR, here is where I had my first issue with these, they did get in my way a little bit as far as cheek weld goes. Not as bad as bigger style of muffs go, but it was noticeable. The hearing protection was again adequate. After shooting my AR, I switched to an M1A scout squad, it's a. 308 caliber rifle, with a muzzle break. Muzzle break= super loud. This was the only gun I was worried about hearing protection with these muffs. I was shocked at how well these worked.  Also, surprisingly, these didn't interfere with cheek weld at all like they did with the AR.

Pros:  comfy
Hearing protection is great.
Headphone jack is a great feature and doesnt use the batteries.
Adjustable.
Fold up small when not in use.
Sound amplification is amazing.

Cons: batteries tend to run out.
You cant tell what direction sound is coming from. Could be a hunting issue.
Occasionally get in the way with cheek weld.

Overall I love these and am super happy I finally got on board.  They're just so much better than ear plugs.

If I could do it over I would have bought the bluetooth version just to avoid a cord running to the phone in my pocket.

27540,1255,1851,"I have an IWB leather holster for my Glock G43 but I am not comfortable carrying an SA pistol that has a trigger safety in a soft holster unless it is not chambered but the idea of carrying is to have the pistol ready to fire if it is ever needed. So I decided to try a Kydex holster which makes me feel much better while carrying a Glock with a round in the chamber.

If you are like me, you most likely have a bunch of holsters because most people start with inexpensive holsters and then start spending more money for more appropriate and comfortable holsters. However, I found that while this holster is not too expensive (around $40.00 at the time of this review), it is very well made and it is very comfortable. I carry my pistol at 5 o'clock (more like 4:30) because I find that this position offers the best case scenario for being able to get to the firearm quickly, have minimal printing and not having to readjust the holster getting in and out a vehicle. Having the firearm in this holster I do not feel it bothering me while I sit even in vehicles that have bucket seats. It was delivered with a slight cant (not sure how many degrees) that allows me to grip the pistol easily and did not have to adjust it at all. The thing that I like the most is that it covers the length of the G43 slide perfectly so it does not touch your body while it makes it very easy to reholster the firearm without looking. Retention is adjustable and I loosened it just a bit when I first received it so now the firearm is still secure enough not to fall off even if I turn it upside down and shake it but also easy to pull of the holster without stretching your belt while the holster is pulling back on the pistol.

I own other IWB holsters for other pistols that I would call ""perfect"" but I paid at least 3 times this price and had them custom made so if you do not want to wait a couple of months or pay the price of a custom made holster, this one is highly recommended and you cannot go wrong with it.

On the older cages the red finish is holding up really well, only wearing out where my steel water bottle rubs against it daily. That is to be expected and it not unusual at all. The blue finish on the new cages looks to be of the same quality.

I like these because of the black plastic things that are the contact point for the bottle. This eliminates vibration, especially with use of a steel bottle that makes A LOT of noise when it's vibrating against an aluminum cage. The plastic contact point also prevents metal on metal rubbing that would wear out the cage and the bottle faster.
