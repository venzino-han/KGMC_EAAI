41870,2525,4374,"This classic film, new to me, was a luxurious surprise, especially in light of its rather ascetic theme. But thats the fun of this storyline, with its metaphorical, sensual, sumptuous feast for the abstemious.  One character wonders aloud if  righteousness and bliss can coexist.  The story is adapted from Isak Dinesens novel, and its a good one.  As it goes, 2 older sisters, devout observers and practioners of a religious order started by their deceased pastor father, spend their days providing care and religion to the scant few remaining members of their sect. Any conflict, or not-okay thought, in the group is met often with much immediate prayerful song, or a big hallelujah on the part of one peacekeeper.  The setting is the remote western coast of Jutland, in 19th century Denmark. Each sister, as shown at the start of the film, had the opportunity of a romantic relationship, but both were duty-bound to dad. One stormy night, a wind and rain-ravaged Babette, pretty much collapses at their door (love that old melodramatic entrance).  But theres a serious subplot:  Babette is a French refugee, fleeing Paris following the murder of her husband and son. She presents a letter of introduction and makes clear that she wants no salary, just a safe place and to cook for the elderly pair. So its sounding pretty serious, but the humor is extraordinary and has a light-handed, measured subtlety that just makes you laugh out loud and hard.  Babette asks permission to prepare a French feast in celebration of the dead fathers 100th birthday.  While they agree, the stoic sisters suffer some angst, even tortured dreams, in anticipation of the gustatory decadence.  But desire prevails, and indulgent excesses are about to be secretly tolerated.  If I told you more, Id be spoiling. The acting is excellent across the board, Stephane Audran, a captivating Babette, Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer, winning, as the mature sisters.  Per Norgards music is just right and the operatic pieces beautiful. Gabriel Axels direction is exquisite, and Henning Kristiansens cinematography with Finn Henriksens editing, pure quality. There is considerable attention to atmospheric detail. amplifying time and place.  The film is a rare one and should be a part of any film lovers storehouse.",1524268800,5,classic film new luxuri surpris especi light rather ascet theme that fun storylin metaphor sensual sumptuou feast abstemi one charact wonder aloud righteous bliss coexist stori adapt isak dinesen novel good one goe 2 older sister devout observ praction religi order start deceas pastor father spend day provid care religion scant remain member sect conflict notokay thought group met often much immedi prayer song big hallelujah part one peacekeep set remot western coast jutland 19th centuri denmark sister shown start film opportun romant relationship dutybound dad one stormi night wind rainravag babett pretti much collaps door love old melodramat entranc there seriou subplot babett french refuge flee pari follow murder husband son present letter introduct make clear want salari safe place cook elderli pair sound pretti seriou humor extraordinari lighthand measur subtleti make laugh loud hard babett ask permiss prepar french feast celebr dead father 100th birthday agre stoic sister suffer angst even tortur dream anticip gustatori decad desir prevail indulg excess secretli toler told id spoil act

However, the message was anything but--that it's acceptable to imprison a flying creature in a cage and pass it on or abandon it when you get bored with it, or it becomes too inconvenient for your lifestyle.

There are exotic bird sanctuaries filled to capacity for abandoned birds like the parrot depicted in this film. Many people are attracted to the idea of keeping a parrot in their homes, until they realize that these highly intelligent birds live a long time and need a lot of attention and care, pulling out their own feathers out of frustration if they're neglected.

Keeping a bird from flying is like forcing a human with perfectly functional legs to use a wheelchair. Life in a cage with maybe occasional opportunities to fly around the house is a horrible life for any bird.

Because it sends the wrong message, I don't recommend this film.",1524268800,1,film hollywood cutesi ridicul pretti termin witti librarian handsom aspieish highway worker main charact howev messag anyth butthat accept imprison fli creatur cage pas abandon get bore becom inconveni lifestyl exot bird sanctuari fill capac abandon bird like parrot depict film mani peopl attract idea keep parrot home realiz highli intellig bird live long time need lot attent care pull feather frustrat theyr neglect keep bird fli like forc human perfectli function leg use wheelchair life cage mayb occasion opportun fli around hous horribl life bird send wrong messag dont recommend film

41969,3360,3880,"Cliffhanger(1993) is a good action-suspense-thriller starring Sylvester Stallone and directed by Renny Harlin. It was spoofed in Ace Ventura When Nature Calls(1995) and America's Funniest Home Videos. The MPAA gave it an R rating for violence and foul language. There's a rare NC-17 cut out there. Stallone was cast as Gabriel Walker, a rescue ranger who is traumatized after failing to save a woman. Things get worse when a team of cold blooded, international mercenaries/terrorists search the mountains of Colorado for stolen money. There were a lot of Die Hard clones in those days. The Fox TV Network version removed a scene where Leon's character shoots a teenager to death with a gun. Gabe Walker(Stallone) sweats, bleeds, and almost freezes to death in the film. He's an ordinary guy in an extraordinary situation. John Lithgow is good in the film even with a fake British accent. Rex Linn is intense as a foul mouthed, violent, short tempered, corrupt US Treasury agent.

42008,1608,3550,"Dean Martin Roasts were always a big draw when he was on television, rowdy, raunchy, funny, and all those celebrities!  Dean played the drunk,and he gave an excellent performance.  We do not know if he really was drunk or putting us on. But every time the roasts came on we could count on fun.

In this series of roasts, I realized, no one who was on the program was still alive. It was good to see them, and I particularly liked seeing the women , their dresses, jewels, hair, and makeup. The one episode I particularly enjoyed was the roast for Lucille Ball. Totie Yfields, Vivian Vance, Jack Benny, Henry Fonda, Martin Andy Rowan, Ginger Rogers, Gary Morton and Bob Hope. All funny, not too cutting, but there were good laughs. In one particular segment Kipsy Russell was on, and was coined a not too flattering term. This surprised me, but, of course, those were different times, when racism was readily accepted. This kind of roast did make me wonder if some of the more cutting remarks were taken to heart, I believe some must have been. Celebrities are sensitive and take these kind of moments with difficulty.n. Still it wa# amusing.

Teams in Rome and Oxford: An official South Africa/German Co-Production

This looks like the production (Treasure Guards) is designed to be a pilot for ether a T.V. series of a series of films similar to The Librarian 2004.

It has all the earmarks of a Hallmark movie with fake looking treasures and unrequited love. A tad of Indiana Jones tossed in.

The captain can be strong and decisive while never ceasing to be a woman with feelings. I even like her long hair that it put in a bun most of the time but occasionally gets let down during personal moments. I really hate calling women sir. A woman can be a strong leader without denying who they are. Calling women leaders sir shows the world that women have to take on male pronouns in order to have strength and decisiveness or that if a woman is a strong leader she should want to give up being a woman and embrace the male pronouns. I think that the writers could have come up with a better last name, but I really enjoy watching Captain Janeway and the rest of the crew!",1524355200,4,realli enjoy season make wonder would react similar circumst captain strong decis never ceas woman feel even like long hair put bun time occasion get let person moment realli hate call woman sir woman strong leader without deni call woman leader sir show world woman take male pronoun order strength decis woman strong leader want give woman embrac male pronoun think writer could come better last name realli enjoy watch captain janeway rest crew

42097,5437,424,"This film is surprisingly good. I was expecting another low-grade horror flick with bad acting, poor writing and all the other deficiencies usually seen in so many of these free w/Amazon Prime indie horror movies.  Imagine my surprise and delight to have actually come upon one with very decent acting all around, truly interesting storyline, and direction which kept the pace moving near perfectly.  The lead actress is very good.  At the beginning, I didn't think she would shine one way or another--I was just content to see a decent actress for once.  But as the film progressed, I became aware that she was actually very, very good.  I also must praise the old couple, esp. the wife.  They were able to pull off that pivotal scene, which could so easily have turned comedic.  But that cold expression on the old woman's face chilled all humor out of it.

Another thing I liked was that the writing and dialog had a really natural feel to it.  Nobody said or did anything out of character; no bone-headed decisions or exhibitions of cluelessness.  Very refreshing.  There is virtually no gore or sex in this film, which only shows that a good moviemaker does not need to rely on these things to maintain tension or interest.  I can definitely recommend this film and am going to keep an eye out for any others produced by members of the crew responsible for this one.",1524355200,4,film surprisingli good expect anoth lowgrad horror flick bad act poor write defici usual seen mani free wamazon prime indi horror movi imagin surpris delight actual come upon one decent act around truli interest storylin direct kept pace move near perfectli lead actress good begin didnt think would shine one way anotheri content see decent actress film progress becam awar actual good also must prais old coupl esp wife abl pull pivot scene could easili turn comed cold express old woman face chill humor anoth thing like write dialog realli natur feel nobodi said anyth charact bonehead decis exhibit clueless refresh virtual gore sex film show good moviemak need reli thing maintain tension interest definit recommend film go keep eye other produc member crew respons one

42136,342,2570,"I only wished there was more than just the documentary on this DVD. I have been riveted by Leah Remini's series on Scientology with Mark Rinder who appeared in the documentary. Of course, the documentary covers Tom Cruise more than John Travolta. Spanky Taylor was Travolta's assistant for years. Her story is both shocking and horrifying but all true. Unlike Cruise, Travolta has downplayed his relationship with scientology in recent years. John is still a member of the church but not actively promoting it to the public like Cruise. Tom Cruise's relationship with scientology is particularly troubling in the least.

The other former scientologists in the film recall their history, lives and encounters with the church from a promising beginning to troubling departures which are modern day escapes. The documentary is only two hours but I wished it lasted longer. I was riveted by the former scientologists who confessed their roles in the church. Scientology must be the most troubling and disturbing cult in recent history. L. Ron Hubbard based a life on lies and delusions. His successor, David Miscavige, has been more troubling, disturbing, abusive and violent towards other scientologists. I find Miscavige to be the root of evil in this organization.

David's wife, Shelly, has been out of sight for over a decade. Her sudden absence at Tom and Kate's wedding in Italy awakened Leah Remini. Many of the scientologists were lured by doing good for the world and their lives. Many of the former scientologists have lost money, relationships and education as well but they were also abused in all forms.

I wished the documentary DVD came with special features about the participants and their lives.

Kevins brother. This is a film without much of a backstory. The performances by Helen Mirren and Kyra Sedgwick are the film. Sedgwick is, of course, Kevins wife,

Mirren plays a woman who has had a nervous breakdown. We never know why the breakdown occurs, or what led up to it, we can only guess.  She is home at their summer place on Cape Cod. Her husband played by Beau Bridges, has hired a summer mothers helper, Kyra Sedgwick. All is not good, until the middle of the film when something occurs that brings the ladies closer. The two children are opposites, Little Richard is like mom, agitates easily, blames his mom for all ills, and Jason, the artistic son, who mom dotes on. The film loses itself at 58mes, and it is left up to us to figure things out.great performances, somewhat of a plot

42142,254,2361,"Movie 6 of 1977 and 47 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime (some sources say 1976 others 1977. I chose the date that worked best for my purposes. I'm not sure what caused the ambiguity).

The first time I heard of ""Eaten Alive"" was during the home movie spurt of the eighties. My dad and I were watching the trailers to a movie we rented. During the trailer for this I remember my dad exclaiming, ""Wait! These are great actors! What are they doing in THIS?"" It's funny, my dad doesn't analyze film. He's a very intelligent man, but when it comes to movies he would prefer to be entertained and move on with his day. Despite this my dad seemed to understand what the point of this movie was: pointless, random violence. Hooper could have used my dad's help as Hooper didn't seem to understand the point as well as my dad. I know now, thanks to IMDB, that actors can't only be in great movies. They will take jobs where they can unless they are superstars. The second time I saw the trailer I was in my early teens a number of years later. I was fascinated by it! It looked like brutal, pointless violence. I wanted to see it so bad! Perhaps it was my age. Well I can say now that it was DEFINITELY pointless and the brutal violence was mainly against the audience!
Everywhere the characters went looked like a studio both indoors and out. A far cry from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Now I'll say that this was a contributing factor to the lack of tension but it wasn't the only reason. In truth Hooper just couldn't deliver tension. He clearly had the skill to, he just couldn't muster it for this one.
Occasionally the antagonist would mumble these monologs to himself. Were these supposed to be insane ravings, insightful musing, or exposition? What I know for certain is that they were boring and uninspired.
Hooper stated clearly that ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was his interpretation of the ethos of Texas. What's his excuse for ""Eaten Alive?"" I think his movies tell us more about him than the environments and judgments he casts down on others. I don't believe Hooper liked what he saw in himself so he blamed outward sources. Of course this is speculation so I won't draw conclusions from it but I don't accept his narrative and tacit conclusions that he doesn't have free will when it comes to objectionable material. The responsibility resided solely with himself.
A credit to Hooper is his willingness to operate out of emotion and feelings. I actually think it was quite courageous. If I was given a budget I would want everything planned out perfectly and that can lead to a sterile, wooden experience for the audience. Unfortunately Hooper's intuitive efforts was a bane for ""Eaten Alive."" Any sense of story de-evolves rather quickly. Scenes are basically pointless and disconnected and not in an intelligent or artistic way that one might expect from dream logic or abstraction. No, the film just wallows in a pointless stupor.
Robert Englund was great as usual. I have never seen him in something where I didn't like him.
What I was hoping for was the brilliance of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" at best or so-bad-it's-good at worst. My expectations were defied and was left with a pointless, boring experience. I did try to be as objective as I could and not compare it to my previous encounter with a Hooper film but I'm not sure how successful I was to be honest.

42172,580,2775,"Carol is enchanting.

Carol is yet another masterpiece of LGBTQ cinema along the lines of Blue Is the Warmest Color, Moonlight, Call Me by Your Name, A Single Man, or Love, Simon. Carol is as heartfelt and emotional as any great romance drama.

Todd Haynes directs Carol with a touching sincerity. He captures the heart of the romance and the fear of the forbidden love. The numerous close up shots of faces and hands are lovely. They really convey the hidden love these characters feel. The cinematography is equally beautiful as every panning shot holds your attention.

The leading actresses Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are sublime. You believe their pain, you see their uncertainty, you feel their passion, and you root for their love. Blanchett portrays a divorcing mother with a strong will and such empathy. Mara is so sweet and innocent that you want her to be happy. Carol contains two exemplary performances by two of the finest actresses in Hollywood.

Carol is worth seeing for a heartbreaking romance.",1524355200,5,carol enchant carol yet anoth masterpiec lgbtq cinema along line blue warmest color moonlight call name singl man love simon carol heartfelt emot great romanc drama todd hayn direct carol touch sincer captur heart romanc fear forbidden love numer close shot face hand love realli convey hidden love charact feel cinematographi equal beauti everi pan shot hold attent lead actress cate blanchett rooney mara sublim believ pain see uncertainti feel passion root love blanchett portray divorc mother strong empathi mara sweet innoc want happi carol contain two exemplari perform two finest actress hollywood carol worth see heartbreak romanc

As if the premise of apocalyptic plague wasn't depressing enough, this flick drags you through 94 minutes of frustrating character conflicts, misplaced compassion leading to cruel ends, and people giving up hope.

It's a very-well-produced indie film, undoubtedly, and the acting is quite good across the entire cast, although Chris Pine turns in another familiar portrayal of...well...Chris Pine.

The plot is straightforward: Two brothers and their girlfriends try to navigate through a dreary, plague-ravaged American landscape encountering and dealing with (or not dealing with) other paranoid survivors along the way.  That's about it.  There's no cure for the contagious hemmorrhagic disease, just occasional vague rumors of treatments that give some survivors a little fleeting hope.

The most frustrating thing about the film are the liberal, urban-bred characters who throw caution to the wind and, consequently, expose themselves and everyone else to deadly disease and other dangers.  A solid half of the plot would be unnecessary except for dimwitted characters who can't follow the simplest precautions.  It's infuriating.

Technically, it's a good film, no question about that.  But do you feel entertained or satisfied or uplifted for watching it?  No.  It's a perpetually sad story from beginning to end that only succeeds in producing a sense of hopelessness.",1524355200,2,keep serotonin reuptak inhibitor hand one premis apocalypt plagu wasnt depress enough flick drag 94 minut frustrat charact conflict misplac compass lead cruel end peopl give hope verywellproduc indi film undoubtedli act quit good across entir cast although chri pine turn anoth familiar portray ofwellchri pine plot straightforward two brother girlfriend tri navig dreari plagueravag american landscap encount deal deal paranoid survivor along way that there cure contagi hemmorrhag diseas occasion vagu rumor treatment give survivor littl fleet hope frustrat thing film liber urbanbr charact throw caution wind consequ expo everyon el deadli diseas danger solid half plot would unnecessari except dimwit charact cant follow simplest precaut infuri technic good film question feel entertain satisfi uplift watch perpetu sad stori begin end succe produc sen hopeless

42229,2323,4838,"A movie that was truly well ahead of its time in the recognition of artificial intelligence (AI) and its eventual clash with humanity. It's very reminiscent of the movie War Games from the 1980's, only it was made a decade earlier! This Blu-Ray release has a very vibrant and sharp video transfer that was not available in earlier DVD releases.

No spoilers here, but the movie jumps straight into the main story with the computer Colossus quickly outpacing the intelligence of its human inventors shortly after being switched on. This dilemma played out very similarly in the Terminator movies when it's own ""Skynet"" computer network was activated. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game between human and computer as each tries to keep one step ahead of the other for control of the world.

There is some excellent acting and direction in this movie which belies the limited distribution and fanfare that it received upon its release. I remember first seeing it in the 1980's on late night TV and wondered what had happened to it. Even on home video it never seemed to get the wide release that most sci-fi movies enjoyed. It's original release date put it well ahead of the huge boost in popularity sci-fi enjoyed with the release of Star Wars in 1977 and after the demise of the original Star Trek TV series. American audiences just weren't buying into sci-fi in that period of our history, I guess. The film also put up-front the doom and gloom of the ongoing cold war with the Soviet Union at the time, which may have been a bit too much reality for audiences of the day.

As movies go, Colossus stands up very well over time and can be seen as the inspiration for many films that came after it. Although some of the depictions of computers may seem a bit out-of-date at present, the concept of AI vs humans is still very much relevant and will continue to be so for some time into the future.",1524441600,4,movi truli well ahead time recognit artifici intellig ai eventu clash human reminisc movi war game 1980 made decad earlier bluray releas vibrant sharp video transfer avail earlier dvd releas spoiler movi jump straight main stori comput colossu quickli outpac intellig human inventor shortli switch dilemma play similarli termin movi skynet comput network activ rest movi basic cat mous game human comput tri keep one step ahead control world excel act direct movi beli limit distribut fanfar receiv upon releas rememb first see 1980 late night tv wonder happen even home video never seem get wide releas scifi movi enjoy origin releas date put well ahead huge boost popular scifi enjoy releas star war 1977 demis origin star trek tv seri american audienc werent buy scifi period histori guess film also put upfront doom gloom ongo cold war soviet union time may bit much realiti audienc day movi go colossu stand well time seen inspir

The movie sort of documents her relationships with those around her.  It's good, but just not that compelling.  On the other hand, maybe it's closer to real life than movies usually are.  For instance, she could have fallen in love with Sam Worthington's character and lived happily ever after (maybe that happens after the movie ends).

42314,2262,1895,"Pretty damned good psychological/paranormal thriller, inasmuch as we have two sterling actors, Anthony Hopkins and Colin Farrell, in the roles of adversarial clairvoyants working opposite sides of the law.

Hopkins is showing his age badly now, but he's still agile as a cat with his dialogue.

This is a heady film, for the most part, asking the viewer to ponder whether mercy killings should be classified as acts of homicide or acts of kindness; but it still manages to deliver some decent action and crime-scene chills and thrills.

Also features some fairly beautiful visual effects, as when Hopkins clairvoyantly observes a deceased woman's last moments before her death in a bathtub full of lilies.  Slick piece of digital work.

The film does demand your undivided attention, because the plot is rather serpentine and filled with non sequitur clairvoyant visions that intrude into the storyline, and there's not much refresher dialogue to bring you up-to-speed as the film progresses.

No spoilers here, but it does have a mildly surprising ending.",1524441600,4,pretti damn good psychologicalparanorm thriller inasmuch two sterl actor anthoni hopkin colin farrel role adversari clairvoy work opposit side law hopkin show age badli he still agil cat dialogu headi film part ask viewer ponder whether merci kill classifi act homicid act kind still manag deliv decent action crimescen chill thrill also featur fairli beauti visual effect hopkin clairvoyantli observ deceas woman last moment death bathtub full lili slick piec digit work film demand undivid attent plot rather serpentin fill non sequitur clairvoy vision intrud storylin there much refresh dialogu bring uptospe film progress spoiler mildli surpris end

42323,1194,4746,"This was a good, atmospheric supernatural horror film set in Japan. It wasn't particularly gory, had a lot of jump scares, at times it was actually quite beautiful, had great production values, was well cast and well-acted, had believable dialogue, and the main characters personality and history figured nicely into the narrative.

The story centers on the character Sara Price (played by Natalie Dormer). She gets a call from police in Japan that her identical twin sister Jess is dead. She was seen going into Aokigahara, a forest at the northwest base of Mount Fuji in Japan, long famous as a destination for the suicidal to venture to (and also quite, quite haunted). Over the fairly reasonable objections of her fianc Rob (played by Eoin Macken)  as Jess has gotten into trouble before and Sara has always come to her rescue  Sara flies to Japan and stays at the hotel Jess had been staying at.

At the hotel Sara meets another American, a reporter by the name of Aiden working for an Australian company (Aiden is played by Taylor Kinney). She grills him about Jess, they bond some, with Sara sharing the sad tale of her parents death from a drunk driver years earlier and the very different ways Jess and her handled it (Jess looked at the horror, Sara kept her eyes closed), Aiden ends up inviting Sara to accompany him to the forest as a park guide by the name of Michi (played by Yukiyoshi Ozawa). Michi is on a trip to find people who might be wanting to commit suicide in the forest and if possible talk them out of it, and if he finds dead bodies to note them for other park rangers to retrieve.

Michi is quite reluctant to bring along Sara, mainly because there is a legend that the ghosts of the forest will tempt those already sad to stay and commit suicide and he rightly sees Sara is already sad.

The following day the three enter Aokigahara, with Michi noting that if the see a tent it means whoever entered the forest might be having doubts about committing suicide, while if they leave behind twine or rope they either want to find their way out again or sadly want people to be able to find their body when they have died.

The three towards the end of the day find Jesss tent  we see this tent in an earlier, creepy flashback, the tents ownership confirmed when Sara finds some of Jesss things in the tent  but Michi doesnt want to stay and search, not wild about being in Aokigahara at night (saying he fears being lost, though I think he was also a bit fearful of the place after dark for other reasons). Both Michi and Aiden try to convince Sara to return with them, fail, and Aiden volunteers to stay with Sara overnight, with Michi returning the next day and having given Aiden and Sara firm orders to stay put.

They of course do nothing of the kind, as in an amazingly short amount of time both end up wandering off from their tiny campfire, with Sara finding a young Japanese girl called Hochiko, one who claims to know Jess and warns Sara not to trust Aiden (but doesnt stick around when she hears Aidens voice).

What happens next is a series of ghostly encounters, mounting paranoia over whether or not Aiden may have killed Jess or at least lied about knowing her before he met Sara, with the viewer wondering how much of what Sara sees is real, how much imagined or in dreams. I won't say more than that, but there were many scenes that weren't what they appeared at first, lots of creepy jump scares, and quite a few ghosts.

I liked the movie, the woods were beautiful, I liked the twist of Sara wondering if Aiden was a killer or not at least (believably so) who he said he was (did he already know Jess, was he really a journalist or just trying to pick up Sara, how much of their conversations had he recorded?). The supernatural menace of Aokigahara was subtle, as Gollum might say tricksy, with not say a creature that will just come out and kill you, no, but if you are in the woods (and especially if you are already sad) you are in grave danger as it plays on your mind and your perceptions.

Though Sara and Jess outwardly differed only by hair color (Sara was blonde while Jess was dark-haired), they differed a lot in personality and this personality differences (Sara being the rescuer, Jess the adventurer, Sara still sad about the past, Jess moving on  this established in a flashback scene  and importantly Sara having closed her eyes at the sight of their dead parents, not only not having embraced a very dark moment in her life but having guilt that Jess bore that burden alone), these differences played a big role in how the two handled this haunted forest.

Few complaints about the movie from me. I don't know how Sara didn't see Hochiko as a ghost, just wandering in the woods at night with no light and with mysterious knowledge of Jess. Sara certainly got used to the idea during the movie that she couldn't trust her eyes and had in fact seen ghosts, but she never was to me sufficiently skeptical of Hochiko. I think Aidens and Saras early separation at Jesss tent after Sara went to bed was very poorly explained, though them separating was vital to the story. It wasn't a huge problem and given the lying, deceptive nature of the forest it might have been different for Sara then it was for Aiden.

I have seen some reviews say that the Aokigahara was somewhat trivialized by its use in the movie. I cant really speak to anything other than my impression and that wasn't how I felt. No one mocked those who went to the forest to die or to at least contemplate dying, when bodies were found they weren't lingered on as being grotesque and the other characters  if they weren't frightened  did treat the bodies with respect. I also didn't see anything I would call stereotypical Japanese behavior (there were other characters, including Japanese police officers, rangers, hotel workers, and students and teachers at Jesss school that Sara meets).  Japan wasn't presented as a superstitious place and indeed most people connected with the forest itself acted in a professional and compassionate manner with regards to Aokigahara.",1524441600,4,good atmospher supernatur horror film set japan wasnt particularli gori lot jump scare time actual quit beauti great product valu well cast wellact believ dialogu main charact person histori figur nice narr stori center charact sara price play natali dormer get call polic japan ident twin sister jess dead seen go aokigahara forest northwest base mount fuji japan long famou destin suicid ventur also quit quit haunt fairli reason object fianc rob play eoin macken jess gotten troubl sara alway come rescu sara fli japan stay hotel jess stay hotel sara meet anoth american report name aiden work australian compani aiden play taylor kinney grill jess bond sara share sad tale parent death drunk driver year earlier differ way jess handl jess look horror sara kept eye close aiden end invit sara accompani forest park guid name michi play yukiyoshi ozawa michi trip find peopl might want commit suicid forest possibl talk find dead bodi note park ranger retriev michi quit reluct bring along sara mainli

42364,2733,3097,"The village of Sotoba was surrounded by death, until death came creeping in the night, claiming its inhabitants, one by one.

Some these villagers don't stay dead. They rise fom their graves, making the local legend of the okaegari (vampire) a reality.

 Shimizu Megumi, a village girl dreaming of the big city is one of the first to fall and rise. Yuuki Natsuno, the boy she desired enough to stalk from beyond the grave finds that neither he nor anyone he loves is safe from Megumis hunger. Ozaki Toshio-sensei, the long suffering village doctor, finds himself dealing with an epidemic he can neither control nor stop, until hes confronted with the source of Sotobas ailment. Aspiring writer and young monk Moroi Seishin, who was already trapped in a life he didn't want, expresses his darkness in his prose, only to meet a fan whose love of his literature may have doomed to the village to suffer the same darkness.

These characters take on a central part in the tragic drama which enfolds Sotoba, giving most of its residents a voice. For the okaegari are not undetected. If theres one thing more terrifying than the creatures creeping out from their graves, its the violence of humanity rising to meet them.

This is not a light hearted show. Nor is it for viewers who require a happy ending. It asks hard moral questions, creeping into ambiguous moral territory. It takes a classical horror story of the undead rising, giving it a new twist and new depth. It tells a dark story, using beautiful animation, haunting music, drawing the viewers into its sinister ambience and the fearful perspective of the characters, growing aware of the monsters creeping up on them. Slowly, our perspective expands to include the monsters as well, leaving us no longer certain whom were rooting for.

This is horror, explored in a rich depth not always given to the genre. Its one of the most well crafted stories Ive ever seen, among the best in horror, if not the best.

This is why I give this series five stars.",1524441600,5,villag sotoba surround death death came creep night claim inhabit one one villag dont stay dead rise fom grave make local legend okaegari vampir realiti shimizu megumi villag girl dream big citi one first fall rise yuuki natsuno boy desir enough stalk beyond grave find neither anyon love safe megumi hunger ozaki toshiosensei long suffer villag doctor find deal epidem neither control stop he confront sourc sotoba ailment aspir writer young monk moroi seishin alreadi trap life didnt want express dark prose meet fan whose love literatur may doom villag suffer dark charact take central part tragic drama enfold sotoba give resid voic okaegari undetect there one thing terrifi creatur creep grave violenc human rise meet light heart show viewer requir happi end ask hard moral question creep ambigu moral territori take classic horror stori undead rise give new twist new depth tell dark stori use beauti anim haunt music draw viewer sinist ambienc fear perspect charact grow awar monster creep slowli perspect expand includ monster well leav u

42371,199,4592,"This is the only movie I've ever seen that gave that heart pumping anxiety.  I know there is actual real footage that is much worse, but I don't watch those kinds of things. I found it ironic that an Italian made this film about Americans since the worst savagery of western civilization was committed by Ancient Romans and as far as I know it's not customary for young Americans to go off to the Amazon with a mind to terrorize natives. Another irony is that the filmmaker was actually filming the future scene of one of histories most savage acts, which was perpetrated on Americans at the World Trade Center. So the final commentary ""who are the real savages?"" ended up being a terrorist. If anything I think this film gives civilization a dose of humanity at it's lowest possible level and destroys the romanticism of ""going native"" which is so often portrayed in western cinema. The most recent example is ""Lost City of Z"" which portrays Percy Fawcett's death at the hands of the natives as a kind of mystical end that Percy welcomed. In reality it was probably more like Cannibal Holocaust with Percy and his son meeting the worst kind of end. The fact is the meanings in the film are nonsensical, because in truth everybody involved in this film probably didn't trade their homes in society and go off and join the cannibal tribe. Are they so comfortable in their life that they have to invent outlandish comparisons? I'm sure you could also take the communist approach as well and say the film is about American capitalism and how the Americans are driven, as portrayed by the 4 journalists, to commit savage acts to achieve monetary gains. Once again, it's nonsensical because that is not reality because if was reality they wouldn't have to use a fictional story to achieve their message. Despite that, I will say the film succeeded where almost all films fails, which is somewhere in it is some deeper truth about life and humanity that might not be utterly clear, but regardless you feel it.",1524441600,4,movi ive ever seen gave heart pump anxieti know actual real footag much wors dont watch kind thing found iron italian made film american sinc worst savageri western civil commit ancient roman far know customari young american go amazon mind terror nativ anoth ironi filmmak actual film futur scene one histori savag act perpetr american world trade center final commentari real savag end terrorist anyth think film give civil dose human lowest possibl level destroy romantic go nativ often portray western cinema recent exampl lost citi z portray perci fawcett death hand nativ kind mystic end perci welcom realiti probabl like cannib holocaust perci son meet worst kind end fact mean film nonsens truth everybodi involv film probabl didnt trade home societi go join cannib tribe comfort life invent outlandish comparison im sure could also take communist approach well say film american capit american driven portray 4 journalist commit savag act achiev monetari gain nonsens realiti

BUT, still love this redo of the Dumas novel that still has sinister bad men to despise.  Rupert Everett and Mathew McNulty are the conniving political evil doers in the final season.
Athos (Tom Burke) is permitted a formidable love interest, Sylvie, in this go around.
Gotta love how the series strays from the popular movies just enough so you don't know what is going to happen and just who might die among the stars of the show.

42431,969,3006,"I watched this last night - it's well worth revisiting - it's a very funny film. Goldie Hawn carries humour effortlessly with a wonderful supporting cast. But beyond the indisputable humour there is warmth (you genuinely care about Benjamin) and a serious message. It might not be Thelma and Louise, but it's up there with it.

Watching the film last night was interesting considering the Weinstein scandal at the moment, the number of increased reports concerning sexual abuse and women's position in society in general. The film is good at showing a woman blind to her own capabilities, caught in a world where the men around her might think they love her, but really don't pay any attention to her - but nor does Benjamin herself! She is trapped in a role which society relentlessly imposes on her.

Watch as her father lovingly gives her an astounding wedding present, but then totally ignores her as he watches the game on the TV, asking her to pass him cigarettes, matches - this on her wedding day. Then her husband in the car, just after the wedding, as he asks Benjamin to perform a certain sexual duty. It's hilarious, but also shocking in the one-sided demand and lack of real love. Then the husband makes a similar request at home - this time he gets his 'come uppance'.

Will the third husband be any better?

The humour always has first place in this film (I think?). Goldie Hawn as a natural comedian, knows how to make fun of herself and there are wonderful moments. The film has a lot to compare with Legally Blonde and Reese Witherspoon excellently handles that role. Where Private Benjamin veers off, is that it is more grounded. Legally Blonde goes all the way with the Kitsch. In PB, there is an observation that society thinks Benjamin loses it when she joins the army. The reality is she is totally lost when home-chained. She even loses her sense of taste, I don't want to give too much away.

One of the phrases casually thrown out about the the last generation and sexual inequality is, 'things were different then' as though there was no awareness of women's rights in the eighties, all men were bullies and men had no sexual manners. It's false to think of men as a single group: some men are decent some are not - same for women. I'm not so sure how things were so different. Of course there was awareness, there was a huge wave of political awareness mid-sixties onwards on all sorts of angles, the bomb, race matters, sexual equality, over population  - in some ways things have gone backwards. Look at current commercials where women, 'free of men', are slaves to products, the female image is shallow.

This film covers those issues - the awareness was clearly there -  it makes you wonder . . . how long does change take?

The one star reviews here say the film is dated, the polemic takes over the humour, the men are portrayed in a shallow way. I don't think so, this is comedy, some slack has to be given. It came out with an ""R"" rating - it's not pretending to be inoffensive. True, it could do with some consistently positive male roles, but as a film observing a trapped woman discovering what she wants to do with her life, it's a good film. Don't watch this film if you wish to identify with a male role model.",1524441600,5,watch last night well worth revisit funni film goldi hawn carri humour effortlessli wonder support cast beyond indisput humour warmth genuin care benjamin seriou messag might thelma louis watch film last night interest consid weinstein scandal moment number increas report concern sexual abus woman posit societi gener film good show woman blind capabl caught world men around might think love realli dont pay attent benjamin trap role societi relentlessli impos watch father lovingli give astound wed present total ignor watch game tv ask pas cigarett match wed day husband car wed ask benjamin perform certain sexual duti hilari also shock onesid demand lack real love husband make similar request home time get come uppanc third husband better humour alway first place film think goldi hawn natur comedian know make fun wonder moment film lot compar legal blond rees witherspoon excel handl role privat benjamin veer ground legal blond goe way kitsch pb observ

42453,2138,4077,"There are two kinds of Bill Murray characters the actor plays in his films: One is the wise-cracking, smart-a**, authority bashing rebel who goes up against the system and gets the girl. This list of course includes Caddyshack, Stripes, Meatballs, Ghostbusters and the like. The other is the world-weary, resigned, much deeper and darkly deadpan Bill. This era kind of began with Groundhog Day and has run to include Rushmore, Lost in Translation, Moonrise Kingdom, St, Vincent and others. The subject of this review, Broken Flowers, is firmly in the world-weary camp. This would have to be one of Bill's best performances, and I think it's sad that it's not often recognized as such.
  Bill plays an aging ladies man who gets a mysterious letter in the mail from an old flame, saying that he has a son out there somewhere. With the help of his amateur detective neighbor (Jeffrey Wright) he goes off on a road trip to find the truth. The ex-girlfriends from the past do not, however, lead him anywhere to the truth. The film has a great twist at the end, which I of course won't give away. But pay attention to one of the credits at the end of the film, during the credit roll. That might contain the answer. Sometimes it does pay to watch the credits.
  Jim Jarmusch put this little beauty together, and it just drips with his deadpan cool and bone-dry wit. The whole sequence with Jessica Lange as a ""pet therapist"" is note for note perfect, down to Chloe Sevigny in her Go-Go-esque day-glo outfit. Sharon Stone and Tilda Swinton also deliver as two of the ex-girlfriends. I also liked the recurring joke of people noticing the similarity between Bill's character's name, Don Johnston, and a certain popular 80's TV actor of Miami Vice fame. And then there are moments which work only because Bill Murray pulls them off. The scene with Bill alone in his home, with a drink sitting in front of him and Marvin Gaye's ""I Want You"" playing on the stereo, is priceless. Any other actor doing this scene would be a waste of celluloid. But Bill gives it that deadpan, hillarious touch that only he can give it. Will he or won't he? Come on Bill, you know you want to. It's amazing to look back and notice in Bill Murray films how the little things he does, the small gestures, the tiny inflections, matter more than anything else. The man is a walking masterclass of acting.
  Now some astute film buffs may have noticed that this movie has a similarity to the greatest film ever made, Citizen Kane. It does. Bill is the reporter Thompson, the identity of his love child is Rosebud, and his ex-girlfriends are the various witnesses. And the mystery is all the more mysterious at the end, when we find out the secret in almost a throwaway moment. If you're gonna rip off somebody, rip off the best. No crime in that. The Kurasawa film Rashoman also bears a resemblance to Broken Flowers, right down to one of the ""witnesses"" already being dead. (Also referenced in Kane with the diary of the late Walter P. Thatcher.) This film even bears a closer resemblance to the Gary Oldman, Beethoven biopic Immortal Beloved. Anybody remember that one? But this is still it's own fine film, and Bill once again delivers in a roll that just deepens an already great career. If you haven't caught this one, then by all means do so. Absolutely recommended.-----------PEACE",1524441600,5,two kind bill murray charact actor play film one wisecrack smarta author bash rebel goe system get girl list cours includ caddyshack stripe meatbal ghostbust like worldweari resign much deeper darkli deadpan bill era kind began groundhog day run includ rushmor lost translat moonris kingdom st vincent other subject review broken flower firmli worldweari camp would one bill best perform think sad often recogn bill play age ladi man get mysteri letter mail old flame say son somewher help amateur detect neighbor jeffrey wright goe road trip find truth exgirlfriend past howev lead anywher truth film great twist end cours wont give away pay attent one credit end film credit roll might contain answer sometim pay watch credit jim jarmusch put littl beauti togeth drip deadpan cool bonedri wit whole sequenc jessica lang pet therapist note note perfect chloe sevigni gogoesqu dayglo outfit sharon stone tilda swinton also deliv two exgirlfriend also like recur joke peopl notic similar bill charact name johnston certain popular 80 tv
42454,265,892,"A possessed computer makes robot minions, evil gory zombified cyborgs and a hulking destructive juggernaut to stalk a star-studded cast on a high-tech Russian vessel. Is this movie for you? Come on, you know who you are.

This gory 90s thrill ride opens when a spaceship (and/or lifeform) of pure energy ravages the MIR space station and beams itself down to a Russian research vessel only to be discovered by a desperate tugboat crew-turned-ship salvers hoping to return the seemingly abandoned, dead in the water ship for riches.

OUR CREW includes Captain Everton (Donald Sutherland; The Puppet Masters, Invasion of the Body Snatchers), his engineer (William Baldwin; Sliver, Flatliners), Kit (Jamie Lee Curtis; Halloween I-II, Scream Queens, Prom Night, The Fog), Woods (Marshall Bell; A Nightmare on Elm Street Part II, Starship Troopers, Total Recall), Squeaky (Julio Oscar Mechoso; Machete Kills, Planet Terror), Hiko (Cliff Curtis; Sunshine, Fear the Walking Dead, Push, Deep Rising) and Nadia (Joanna Pacula; The Kiss, Warlock: The Armageddon).

Based on Chuck Pfarrers Dark Horse comic series, director John Bruno (visual effects for Terminator 2, The Abyss, AVP: Aliens vs Predator, Fright Night, Poltergeist I-II) terrorizes a films tugboat salvage crew while sampling his favorite moments from the Predator and Terminator and Alien franchises, The Thing (1982) and Hardware (1990). It seems that Agent Smith (The Matrix trilogy) wasn't the only nonhuman entity to classify mankind as a virusour energy-based alien lifeform came to the same conclusion. To expedite the extermination, it hijacked the ships computer and electrical system, developed several castes of robot minions to do its murderous bidding, and eventually sought human victims for spare parts to make evil macabre cyborgs appearing as much zombie as robot! Basically, were dealing with a very small version of SkyNet becoming self-aware and, like Agent Smith, it even bargains with a greedy malevolent human.

The special effects span a broad range hitting us in three phases (i.e., as we learn more about our monster and its capabilities) but improve notably as the film progresses. At first, we find little robotic spiders and flies clumsily clunking about while dragging extension cords in their wake. And like little transformers, they have bitty nail guns and buzz saws. This is about as silly as it sounds but they're cute and boast a sort of practical effects charm.
Much as The Thing (1982), human victims are overtaken as cyborgs with a (now more evil) semblance of their conscious selves. They look like chunky macabre T-800s with a dash of Borginess (Star Trek: First Contact). This portion of the special effects will please gorehounds and lend credibility to a film already boasting a better cast than ever it deserved. This weird little flick is surprisingly decent!

The final phase of the effects is a CGI-enhanced stop-motion hulking menace; a giant robot undertaking the hive mother mainframes most destructive or dire tasks. This thing looks awesome and moves with frightful haste. It reminds me of the MCU Hulk as it bashes through walls and rends steel barricades.

This movie really holds up, continues to boast highly entertaining effects and gore, and is supported by an outstanding cast. Even the script felt highly capable (a rarity in films like this) and I had no major criticism from the direction. No, this is no Oscar winner. But this is not a bad movie. Its a pretty great sci-horror in terms of entertainment value and it deserves so much more attention.",1524441600,5,posse comput make robot minion evil gori zombifi cyborg hulk destruct juggernaut stalk starstud cast hightech russian vessel movi come know gori 90 thrill ride open spaceship andor lifeform pure energi ravag mir space station beam russian research vessel discov desper tugboat crewturnedship salver hope return seemingli abandon dead water ship rich crew includ captain everton donald sutherland puppet master invas bodi snatcher engin william baldwin sliver flatlin kit jami lee curti halloween iii scream queen prom night fog wood marshal bell nightmar elm street part ii starship trooper total recal squeaki julio oscar mechoso machet kill planet terror hiko cliff curti sunshin fear walk dead push deep rise nadia joanna pacula kiss warlock armageddon base chuck pfarrer dark hors comic seri director john bruno visual effect termin 2 abyss avp alien v predat fright night poltergeist iii terror film tugboat salvag crew sampl favorit moment predat termin alien franchis thing 1982 hardwar 1990 seem agent smith matrix trilog wasnt nonhuman entiti classifi mankind virusour energybas alien lifeform came conclus expedit extermin hijack ship comput electr system develop sever cast robot minion murder bid eventu sought human victim spare part make evil macabr cyborg appear much zombi robot basic deal small version skynet becom selfawar like agent smith

42574,1608,5544,"I kept thinking while I was watching this film that We Need A Mr Rogers, Now! This man who is so comforting, who likes us just the way we are, and does not ask more of us than we can give. Everyone should have a Mr Rogers in their life.

Ben Wagner met Fred Rogers on Cape Cod where Ben was vacationing. Fred Rogers and his wife had a small corner home right near the water. It was big enough for them and very comfortable. They could relax and enjoy their neighbors. Fred helped Ben through some difficulties with his kind words and direction. They wrote and emailed each other.

When Fred died, Ben and Chris traveled the land looking for people whose lives were touched by Fred Rogers. They found many people, and in this documentary, we get to meet them all, and hear their stories. This is one of the most comforting and tear inducing documentaries. The love and joy Mr Rogers brought into their lives is immeasurable. It seems Mr Rogers touched people just by walking into the room, he had some sort of quality that attracted the good in people. We get to meet one of Freds sons and grandson, what a joy that is. We can see in Fred Rogers eyes what love he had for them. Freds son had the same kind of loving demeanor that Fred had. I often wonder what it must have been like being brought up by Fred Rogers.

Everyone should see this film to remind us what kindness, love and joy brings.

42575,3475,5612,"Come on, we all know there's a script already written. Absolutely do NOT deviate from it, else it becomes a lie, and we all know who the father of all lies is.

Also, minus points for missing bits. John acts like he doesn't know who Jesus is, yet later on it's revealed they've been friends since childhood? Jesus is referred to as Yeshewa for the first half of the show, then they suddenly switch to Jesus? Mary has a modern haircut? And again with the all-white cast? And an overweight Jesus to boot? The acting is fair to midlin, at least done well enough it didn't make me want to rip my ears off. The man who portrayed the elder Satan character was actually pretty decent.

Having said that, I'm still going to give it three stars, but only because it depicts a very serious time of Jesus' life and some of the turmoil he surely would have gone through during his long trial.

Also, note to writers: PLEASE learn how to properly use the pronouns ""I"" and ""me"". If in doubt, remove the other person from the sentence and test which would be appropriate. And if you can't be bothered to remember that, a good rule of thumb is: A misused ""I"" sounds pretentious and snooty. A misused ""me"" sounds down-homey, so it's much better to make the mistake on that side.",1524528000,3,come know there script alreadi written absolut deviat el becom lie know father lie also minu point miss bit john act like doesnt know jesu yet later reveal theyv friend sinc childhood jesu refer yeshewa first half show suddenli switch jesu mari modern haircut allwhit cast overweight jesu boot act fair midlin least done well enough didnt make want rip ear man portray elder satan charact actual pretti decent said im still go give three star depict seriou time jesu life turmoil sure would gone long trial also note writer plea learn properli use pronoun doubt remov person sentenc test would appropri cant bother rememb good rule thumb misus sound pretenti snooti misus sound downhomey much better make mistak side

1.) The "" #metoo movement! "" hates it. ({In one episode the male cop, repeatedly, tells a female to ""shut it"". Same man---in multiple episodes--- tells the female cop he doesn't want her opinion. Once, when that woman tells her boyfriend, the lead, that she doesn't want HIM to do something, he, then, tells his best friend ""women say no when they mean yes""--- and is REWARDED for sexist behavior.})
2.) The two male leads make lots of homophobic jokes.
3.) The show also treats race as if it's a JOKE. The white male lead appropriates black culture many, many, MANY times. Asian stereotypes are the joke in ANY episode that features an Asian actor/actress.
4.) SOME people----read the reviews----actually HATE-watch this show just to get outraged!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE TRANSPORTER [2002] Here we have Director Jet Li and the combination of the latest attempt by the French one-man film industry Luc Besson to produce a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and especially throughout the film, where you get to see Jason Statham do some totally awesome and very dramatic over the top driving sequences in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, France and also in Paris, France with the Black BMW 7 Series M760Li xDrive V12 luxury car that will take your breath away and is to some people, if not better than what you will see in some of the James Bond films and check out the audio commentary comments to hear about some hair raising moments. Filmed mainly in the South of France, and adding to this action packed film is of course Jason Statham, who is one of England's rising generation of macho style stars, who holds down the lead as the taciturn reserved and uncommunicative professional driver for criminal undertakings, and the accomplished French actor Franois Berland, a familiar face in art-house films joins in the fun packed film.

Franois Berland plays that beloved stock figure of French crime thrillers, as the police Inspector Tarconi who knows and respects his adversary Frank Martin [Jason Statham], and gets to share a coffee with him while he plays a waiting game in trying to find out if Frank Martin was involved as a driver in a latest bank robbery. Lai [Qi Shu] plays an even  more conventional role of a package Frank Martin [Jason Statham] has agreed to deliver, bound and gagged in his trunk, to a bunch of shady operators led by an American known only as Wall Street [Matt Schulze] who you get to hate big time.

The plot unfolds routinely enough, where Ex-Special Forces operator Frank Martin falls in love with Lia [Qi Shu], and together they take on the evil Wall Street, a smuggler of Chinese refugees who is in cahoots with Ms. Qi Shu's own father figure Mr. Kwai [Ric Young]. But directors Corey Yuen and Louis Leterrier, keeps the exercise moving with stylishly executed car chases, shootouts and kung-fu confrontations, one of which finds an unarmed Jason Statham polishing off what looks like a dozen criminal henchmen adversaries. Frank Martin breaks all his own rules about remaining neutral and gets personally involved in a complicated plot involving people-smuggling, over the top gunfights, and some equally amazing martial arts action.

The film starts off on a high note, with Frank Martin picking up four criminals coming straight out of a bank robbery. What follows is an excitingly staged, perfectly edited car chase through the streets of Paris that works with a few standard jokes directed at police officers who cannot seem to apprehend one driver no matter how many units of backup they call in. This is our introduction to Frank martin, showing him at his fastest, funniest, and cleverest action hero. Jason Statham mugs, he punches his weight, and he is very funny, very strong, and he is a lot more of a threat than he appears.

Once Frank Martin is established as a quiet, sophisticated loner, he is given another package to deliver. Aroused by a newfound curiosity, he opens the package and discovers that it is a young Chinese woman Lia [Qi Shu], who is most likely on a hit-list, but after Frank gives Lia a moment to herself, she escapes and sure enough complications arise.

Later, we discover she is connected to the smuggling of 400 Chinese people in The United States and the threat of their execution. Though she is not directly behind it, Frank Martin has his suspicions. The real villains are the father of the young woman Lia, who is a businessman named Wall Street [Matt Shulze] whose line of work is so vaguely described and is definitely the definition of a nasty belligerent over the top  movie villain that we all love to hate. Jason Stratham is delightfully cool as the imperturbable Transporter, and Qi Shu brings us a cute face, but despite a poor command of the English language, brings a love interest/woman-in-distress role opposite Jason Statham. Matt Schulze is imposing as the nasty bad guy that we all hate on first impression, as well as throughout the film and eventually and deservedly gets his due comeuppance, especially being an absolutely terrible cardboard cut-out and one dimensional actor.

The action sequences are virtually non-stop, with only the occasional brief interruptions to facilitate minor exposition. Every example of hand-to-hand combat that would feature in lots of martial arts and the bonus of high kicks abound, and enough explosives ammo that could be expanded to supply a small army. The film opens with an amazing thing: a car chase that is not at all boring and it is so outrageously over-the-top, that it is just a great deal of fun packed action that really gets the adrenaline kick in. Overall, THE TRANSPORTER film will definitely satisfy anyone who is on the lookout for a really good and over the top action flick and definitely THE TRANSPORTER film destination moves at great pace and is well worth viewing and especially adding to your Jason Statham film collection.

Blu-ray Image Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment brings you this awesome action packed film in an amazing 1080p image presentation that really enhances the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Although this film was released in 2002, during which time a sequel has been released and Jason Statham has cemented his action-star status, but this film still looks like a new release. The image quality is top notch and looks far superior to more high-profile 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment Blu-ray launch titles such  as 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'Fantastic Four.' The film sports a very clean slick look and the visual design aspects are highlighted with very glossy and punchy colours, with lots of shiny surfaces and, during interior scenes, nicely stylized lighting. Blacks are really excellent, and the contrast is really bold, but not blown out of all proportion in the high end image presentation. Without a doubt, THE TRANSPORTER film on this Blu-ray disc delivers an appreciable upgrade over the standard inferior DVD release. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  20th Century Fox Home Entertainment presents this Blu-ray disc with a clever and active sound design comes through nicely in a 5.1 DTS HD lossless mix. The disc also offers us a choice of three audio presentations of English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Italian: 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and English: 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo Audio. Music and sound effects are an integral important aspect of this film, and at times are interchangeable with all elements are well represented throughout the sound design at various points, providing a spacious feel with a very immersive experience. There is also a nice audio balance with the dialogue, which is not obscured at any point in the film. I really liked the punchy sound design experience of this audio presentation.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by Jason Statham and Producer Steven Chasman: First up to introduce himself is Jason Statham and then informs us that Steven Chasman is sitting next to him and are here to input their personal comments on the film who of course were personally involved in this film. The opening shot in the multi-storey car park was shot in Niece and they spent six weeks shooting schedule in that part of France. Jason comments on the Black BMW 7 Series M760Li xDrive V12 luxury car he drove in the film, that has a manual shift and is one of a kind and felt very lucky and honoured to drive it and also comments it was very fast, and the gadgets he got use made it very special to drive, and when he use to watch James Bond films, always dreamed of those special fast cars and now his dream has come true in this film. When we see Jason drive off with the three bank robbers and all that extremely fast driving through the very narrow streets were filmed in real time and most of the time no stunt driver was used and the authorities allowed all the streets to be shut down to interact with the police cars chasing Jason and unfortunately the police eventually do not get there man. The house owned by Jason takes the young Chinese girl Lia, who in the morning makes breakfast and especially bakes the Madeleines de Commercy and when the Police Inspector turns up and gets to eat one the Madeleines and in reality hates and detests the taste and nearly throws up, and in-between shoots Jason and the crew had a good laugh with the situation. As to this house of Jason, that was located in Cassis, Bouches-du-Rhne, France, was built especially for the film and of course we get to see what happens to the house when the gangster henchmen let their fury on it and all the locals came out to film the shoot on their video cameras, but with the film crew had 15 cameras to catch every moment of its destruction and some of the stuntmen got injured. When we see Jason in the prison cell who talks to the actor Franois Berland who plays the Police Inspector, well Jason says he was a very funny person to be with in-between when the cameras have stopped filming. When we see Jason at the Old Port of Marseille where they filmed with the containers and both commentators state that it was totally freezing cold and was a five day shoot, and with the dramatic fight scenes around the containers, Jason informs us that he suffered with very bad grazes with all parts of his body. As the credits roll up the screen, Jason thanks us for watching the film with their audio commentary, and hoped their comments were not boring. Jason also comments that when he first watched the finished film, he was very pleased in what he viewed and also watching the film with all the bad acting scenes cut out and feels the whole experience was very rewarding, especially what was filmed in what they created and especially filming in the very nice locations and felt very rewarded in seeing the film again, and brought back a lot of good and fond memories and feels the film looked really beautiful, and Jason felt the people he worked with were very talented people and again comments that he is very proud to be involved in the film. All in all the audio commentary was quite interesting in hearing Jason Statham talking in a very personal manner, but sadly there were too many silent gaps, but despite this, you should still view this audio commentary, as we hear some very interesting comments about the making of the film.

Theatrical Trailers: Here we get to view five Original Theatrical Trailers and they are as follows: THE TRANSPORTER [2002] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:27]; BEHIND ENEMY LINES [2001] [1080p] [1.78:1] [2:35]; SPEED [1994] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:47]; FANTASTIC FOUR [2005] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:33] and THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN [2003] [1080p] [2.40:1] [1:13].

Finally, THE TRANSPORTER film is a great deal of fun, down-and-dirty action packed film, the type we like to view. It is unapologetically politically incorrect, features sleek visual style, and Jason Statham at his best. This Blu-ray release is a pretty good. The transfer and soundtrack are generally excellent, although Fox continues to not deliver many extras on its initial Blu-ray titles. If supplements are important to you, the you may have to wait and hope for a more extensive remastered Blu-ray disc in the future, but suspect this will not happen. Otherwise, overall the film THE TRANSPORTER is good enough to take out for at least one spin, or even more, if you are a fan like me of the awesome Jason Statham action man. Highly Recommended.

42735,476,2980,"A trio of students tries to make a documentary about a rogue bear killer in Norway. After way too much set up, they find the guy and discover that he hunts something much bigger than a bear. He hunts trolls for a secret government department that wants to keep the trolls contained to their territories and kept away from the public eye. The troll hunter reluctantly lets them document his work.

The movie is a found footage film in the vein of The Blair Witch Project, complete with opening title cards claiming the footage was found on a couple of hard drives and edited down but not enhanced with special effects. And end cards claiming the students have disappeared and anyone with information should contact their local police. As often happens in found footage films, the set up takes too long and the scenes of running away from danger are less interesting and less plausible--the camera is just jiggling around the landscape with maybe some sound effects or the occasional glimpse of something significant. How you feel about found footage films will be a major factor in your enjoyment of the film.

The movie has a weird dynamic--the troll hunter dismisses fairy tales as a source of information but the trolls definitely can smell the blood of a Christian (the troll hunter is not so sure about Muslims). Happily, the movie doesn't bother with a scientific explanation, it just states characteristics of these trolls and you either take it or leave it. The filmmakers are aware of the ridiculousness of the premise but take it seriously enough to keep it out of the realm of mere comedy. The movie is more drama and horror but has enough comedy to make it fun.

The landscapes are truly beautiful, so as a travel film, this is a delight. How you feel about landscapes will be a minor factor in your enjoyment of the film.

Slightly recommended, as a bit of foreign geography and creative license showing someone hunting trolls in modern-day Norway.",1524614400,3,trio student tri make documentari rogu bear killer norway way much set find guy discov hunt someth much bigger bear hunt troll secret govern depart want keep troll contain territori kept away public eye troll hunter reluctantli let document work movi found footag film vein blair witch project complet open titl card claim footag found coupl hard drive edit enhanc special effect end card claim student disappear anyon inform contact local polic often happen found footag film set take long scene run away danger le interest le plausibleth camera jiggl around landscap mayb sound effect occasion glimps someth signific feel found footag film major factor enjoy film movi weird dynamicth troll hunter dismiss fairi tale sourc inform troll definit smell blood christian troll hunter sure muslim happili movi doesnt bother scientif explan state characterist troll either take leav filmmak awar ridicul premis take serious enough keep realm mere comedi movi drama horror enough comedi make fun landscap truli beauti

Alas, this is a wordy, stilted and suffering saga of the infamous clairvoyant, who could see herself as the victor of France, just not its martyr. Some interesting visuals, marred by some tragically short-sighted rear projection. Blu-ray transfer is imperfect too - inconsistent grain, periodic mis-registration of the 3-strip Technicolor and weaker than anticipated contrast.  Wouldn't waste my time on this one again.

42833,102,4034,"THE NIGHT STALKER (1972)

Directed by John Llewellyn Moxey, the story chronicles events in Las Vegas when the bodies of several young women are found drained of blood. Intrepid reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) increasingly suspects that something supernatural is at foot, which his bellowing boss finds incredulous (Simon Oakland), as well as city authorities (Ralph Meeker, Claude Akins & Kent Smith). Elisha Cook Jr is on hand as an informant while Barry Atwater plays Janos Skorzeny.

The Night Stalker was a hugely successful TV movie, which naturally led to a sequel, The Night Strangler (1973), and a series that ran for one season from 1974-1975 (20 episodes), not to mention numerous Kolchak books. This original movie was the best of the batch with The Night Strangler almost as good and even better in some ways. Both movies established the template (formula) for all that followed.

What makes this movie the best of the batch? Answer: The streamlined story is full of intrigue, action, ravishing women, horror and suspense; and the jazzy score doesnt hurt. As far as the women go, lovely Carol Lynley is on hand as Kolchaks babe, but not enough is done with her. Nevertheless, there are 3-4 peripheral beauties. The sequel flick and the first episode The Ripper followed this pilots lead in the female department, along with ""The Werewolf,"" but the rest of the series was rather weak on this front.

Since this is a TV flick from the early 70s don't expect a much gore.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 14 minutes and was shot in Las Vegas with studio work done at Universal Studios & Samuel Goldwyn Studios, CA. WRITER: Richard Matheson (teleplay) & Jeffrey Grant Rice (story).

GRADE: A-

==========

THE NIGHT STRANGLER (1973)

Directed by Dan Curtis, the story chronicles events in Seattle when the strangled bodies of several young women are found. Intrepid reporter Carl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) discovers that the same kinds of murders occur every 21 years dating back to the late 1800s.  Simon Oakland plays Kolchaks bellowing boss while Jo Ann Pflug appears as a genial belly dancer who assists Carl. Scott Brady plays the police captain while Wally Cox is on hand as a helpful scribe. Richard Anderson has a key role.

The Night Strangler was the follow-up to the highly successful The Night Stalker (1972) and led to a series that ran for one season from 1974-1975 (20 episodes), not to mention numerous Kolchak books. The two pilot movies are the best of the batch and established the template (formula) for the series and books.

Like the first film, theres a lot of intrigue, action, ravishing women, horror and suspense, plus a percussion-oriented jazzy score thats even better. The Night Strangler adds a little effective comedy and the antagonist is more complicated. The underground lair is mysterious and the mummified family is creepy, but the details of the alchemists elixir and strategy seem contrived.

Its good to have Kolchak team-up with someone (cutie Pflug), which rarely happens in the ensuing series, but it was welcome when it did (The Energy Eater and Demon in Lace). There are a few peripheral beauties (Regina Parton, Nina Wayne and Francoise Birnheim), which the rest of the series mostly lacked, except for the debut episode, The Ripper, and ""The Werewolf.""

Since this is a TV flick from the early 70s don't expect much gore.

THE MOVIE RUNS 90 minutes (with the original TV release more streamlined at 74 minutes) and was shot in Seattle and the Bradbury Building in downtown, Los Angeles, with studio work done at 20th Century Fox Studios. WRITER: Richard Matheson (teleplay) & Jeffrey Grant Rice (characters & formula).

42859,5437,3007,"I really liked this movie.  I didn't think I would, esp. after the first few scenes, as the guys were
pretty much everything I despise in a human.  I didn't know how long I could endure their
sickening behavior, and only hung in there because I knew a pay-back was coming.  Glad I did,
as the pay-back was very satisfying.  I'd like to send Mr. Lee a list of movie characters to subject
to similar treatment.

The production values were high, the acting good.  This is not some cheapo flick put together
by sub-talented filmmakers with only vain aspirations to support them.  This is a film made
by experienced professionals.  It kept me in suspense the whole time, and cleverly wrapped up
the revenge scenario very nicely with a series of occurrences I didn't see coming.

I notice several people had a problem with how Mr. Lee could possibly orchestrate all this.
For some reason this didn't bother me at all (and such things usually do).  He just did, and
I was able to take it at face value.  I can always suspend belief in one area of a movie if the
rest is as engrossing as this one was.  (I personally thought their neighbors noticing none of
the mayhem was more dubious, lol)

Gore factor is there, but no killings too off-the-wall.  Just standard knife-play, shootings, etc.,
with a fair amount of blood; but all were effectively done without the feel of over-reveling in it.

42880,6459,3061,"A lot of romantic comedy films and similar pictures do nothing more than wallow in cliches, putting together actors and actresses without any chemistry on screen and having them say ludicrous things. This charming film is a great antidote to all that. Talented performers Drew Barrymore and Hugh Grant look totally natural together and seem to radiate out this warmth, all of the dialogue coming naturally. The plot is a satire of the music industry's most silly trends from 80s nostalgia tours to gimmick TV shows with musicians to insensitive religiously-themed performances and more. It's not only genuinely hilarious but features some seriously catchy material. The song ""Pop Goes My Heart"" is just as great as the 80s new wave classics by the likes of Duran Duran and Wham that inspired it, and viewers of this nice film are likely to be humming the tune for days and days.",1524614400,5,lot romant comedi film similar pictur noth wallow clich put togeth actor actress without chemistri screen say ludicr thing charm film great antidot talent perform drew barrymor hugh grant look total natur togeth seem radiat warmth dialogu come natur plot satir music industri silli trend 80 nostalgia tour gimmick tv show musician insensit religiouslythem perform genuin hilari featur serious catchi materi song pop goe heart great 80 new wave classic like duran duran wham inspir viewer nice film like hum tune day day

42894,5437,3025,"I really liked this movie.  I didn't think I would, esp. after the first few scenes, as the guys were
pretty much everything I despise in a human.  I didn't know how long I could endure their
sickening behavior, and only hung in there because I knew a pay-back was coming.  Glad I did,
as the pay-back was very satisfying.  I'd like to send Mr. Lee a list of movie characters to subject
to similar treatment.

The production values were high, the acting good.  This is not some cheapo flick put together
by sub-talented filmmakers with only vain aspirations to support them.  This is a film made
by experienced professionals.  It kept me in suspense the whole time, and cleverly wrapped up
the revenge scenario very nicely with a series of occurrences I didn't see coming.

I notice several people had a problem with how Mr. Lee could possibly orchestrate all this.
For some reason this didn't bother me at all (and such things usually do).  He just did, and
I was able to take it at face value.  I can always suspend belief in one area of a movie if the
rest is as engrossing as this one was.  (I personally thought their neighbors noticing none of
the mayhem was more dubious, lol)

Gore factor is there, but no killings too off-the-wall.  Just standard knife-play, shootings, etc.,
with a fair amount of blood; but all were effectively done without the feel of over-reveling in it.
Language contains a few f-bombs, but WAY less than most of these type films.  No nudity,
and one sex scene so minimal it hardly counts, and really was relevant to the story for a change.

Even today, Women in Love shocks with its brutal honesty; the handling of a rape, homosexuality, casual 'vagina' monologues, nude male wrestling, carefree naked dalliances in the slo-mo swaying tall grasses and suicide - brilliantly acted by Alan Bates,  Oliver Reed and Glenda Jackson, in her Oscar-winning role. By far, one of the most frank and adult movies about 'love' and its detrimental fallout. Brilliantly conceived by Ken Russell in a career as varied that never ceases to amaze. Even his flops are fascinating. But Women in Love is a bona fide classic. Deservedly brought to Blu-ray from Criterion in a pristine transfer that looks spectacular. Lots of extras too.

Andy (John Morris) has grown up and graduated from high school. He will be leaving for college soon. His mother (Laurie Metcalf) wants him to choose what in his room will go to the trash, to the attic or the day care center as a donation. Andy is not ready to part with his toy box of toys and doesn't want to think about it right now, but his mother makes him. So Andy gets a trash bag and puts all the toys in there to take up to the attic. He keeps Woody (Tom Hanks) and puts him in his college box. He drops the bag to help his sister. His mother sees the bag and takes it out to the trash.  A garbage truck is coming. Woody tries to save the other toys, but cleverly, the toys save themselves and make it to the donations box in the car of Andy's mother. Along with Woody, they are all driven to Sunnyside Day Care.  The toys like Sunnyside and want to stay. Woody leaves and wants to find Andy.
  Meanwhile, not all is sunny at this day care. The kids are too rough with the toys and one toy is not so nice after all.

The main actor was really compelling, and there were actually several moving scenes involving his family (and of course his transformation into a vampire). Haha I know, it sounds dumb to praise a vampire movie for its weighty emotional scenes, but I do think that the genre is a good place to explore ideas about death, sudden life changes, being estranged from loved ones, and of course immortality.

Granted, some of the dialogue is quite clunky.

42989,6850,3536,"Unbreakable Machine-Doll is one of the oddest mixtures Ive ever seen in anime (and Ive seen a lot of weird stuff in anime!).  On the one hand this is one of the biggest, most hilarious screwball comedies Ive ever seen as the dedicated, honorable Raishin Akabane manages to assemble one of the most manic, mixed up, and misguided harems in anime history.  On the other hand this is one of the most gruesome series of adventures Ive ever waded through: a serial killer (or killers), a monstrously evil misuse of dogs and children, and a byzantine conspiracy of assassination and God knows what else.  But don't forget to laugh!

Raishin Akabane has come to pre-WWI England from Japan, accompanied by his beautiful automaton, Yaya, in order to enroll in the prestigious Walpurgis Royal Academy to study Machinart: a dangerous blend of magic and technology, but thats just the cover story.  He has really come to England in order to kill someone.  You won't believe who, you won't believe why, you won't believe how, you won't believe his undercover side job, and you won't believe the price he is abjectly willing to pay; however, along the way Raishin, who is chock full of unusual ideas when compared with his mostly British fellow students, keeps running into a problem.  Whenever he sees a young lady in trouble, he just has to help, even if she believes (and thanks to Yaya she usually does) that hes a complete pervert.  He also acquires an advisor, who thinks hes a blithering idiot, and a male friend, who regularly states his intention to kill him eventually.  Starting to see the pattern yet?

This story is told in shimmeringly beautiful animation, a considerable portion of which is very well done computer animation, and contains 12 standard episodes and 6 shorter OVA episodes.  Defects?  The story isn't even CLOSE to being finished, and it doesnt help that the third of the three, four episode stories is more confusing than the rest!  Clearly, at least one more season would be REQUIRED in order to have any closure, and given the premise, Im not sure anything short of the final battle would be satisfactory; however, for while it lasts its a hell of a ride.

Note: No surprise at this point, but the typical anime nudity problem is more messed up than usual here.  On the one hand female breasts get bared in every single episode (even in the credits!), and you will just have to face the situation.  On the other hand is the nude female corpse you get to see in loving detail.  Wont be forgetting that one for a while.  Really NOT for children can I say?

Note: Inspired by the lovingly detailed descriptions of the various English origins of most of the characters, the voice actors have made an effort that would please (or infuriate?) Henry Higgins of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Fair-Lady/dp/B00NN78PKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Fair Lady</a>, by carefully giving the proper English accent to each character.  The result?  Well, while as usual, especially with a complicated, unfinished story like this one, the Japanese with English subtitles makes the most sense, the Voice acting track with all the proper accents is something to behold!",1524614400,4,unbreak machinedol one oddest mixtur ive ever seen anim ive seen lot weird stuff anim one hand one biggest hilari screwbal comedi ive ever seen dedic honor raishin akaban manag assembl one manic mix misguid harem anim histori hand one gruesom seri adventur ive ever wade serial killer killer monstrous evil misus dog child byzantin conspiraci assassin god know el dont forget laugh raishin akaban come prewwi england japan accompani beauti automaton yaya order enrol prestigi walpurgi royal academi studi machinart danger blend magic technolog that cover stori realli come england order kill someon wont believ wont believ wont believ wont believ undercov side job wont believ price abjectli will pay howev along way raishin chock full unusu idea compar mostli british fellow student keep run problem whenev see young ladi troubl help even believ thank yaya usual he complet pervert also acquir advisor think he blither idiot male friend regularli state intent kill eventu start see pattern yet stori told shimmeringli beauti anim consider portion well done comput anim contain 12 standard episod

42994,102,4553,"The TV series Kolchak: The Night Stalker ran for one season in 1974-1975, consisting of 20 episodes. Two additional episodes were scheduled to be filmed, but star Darren McGavin was becoming disillusioned due to an exhausting schedule and the fact that he was rewriting scripts plus doing much of the production work without compensation. The ratings were mediocre so he asked to be released from his contract with two episodes yet to be shot. The network granted his request in light of the ratings. I wish Darren wouldve persevered and finished out the season because then wed have two more episodes to enjoy. He was too fatigued at the time to see that this unique and groundbreaking series would be his most well-known role, along with A Christmas Story (1983).

If you haven't seen the two pilot movies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Night-Stalker-The-Night-Strangler-Double-Feature/dp/B00026L7OU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Night Stalker/The Night Strangler (Double Feature)</a>, I encourage you to view them before checking out the series (the DVD set does NOT include these two movies). The debut movie was the best of the batch with The Night Strangler almost as good and even better in some ways (see my reviews for details). Both movies established the template (formula) for the TV series and myriad books that followed.

The 20 episodes are more of the same, but condensed into 51 minutes and all-around inferior. Theyre all of about the same quality with favorites emerging depending on how interesting the Monster-of-the-Week is, as well as the guest stars, both of which are a matter of taste. The first episode, The Ripper, is a quality beginning for the series but its too much like the two pilot movies for its own good, particularly the first film. Its basically a compressed version with a slightly different monster.

Horror in the Heights is usually cited as the best segment because of the intriguing monster, which can mimic a person the victim trusts. Its actually pretty chilling for mid-70s television. The Trevi Collection is one of my personal favorites because it deviates from formula and contains a twist. The story tackles witchcraft but doesnt make the mistake of doing it in a one-dimensional manner (e.g. the mannequins). The Energy Eater is another fave due to guest stars William Smith, who beams with charisma, and professional-but-sultry Elaine Giftos, both of whom sorta team-up with Kolchak, particularly the former.

The Vampire is distinguished for its ties to the pilot movie and taking place in Los Angeles rather than Chicago, not to mention its vicious no-talking (and sharp) antagonist. Demon in Lace is one of the better episodes due to the intriguing succubus and the campus locale. The Zombie is notable for its formidable foe and one of the creepiest sequences in the last act at a junkyard. The monster make-up in The Werewolf is lame, but I favor the episode because it takes place completely on a cruise ship and features voluptuous & perky Jackie Russell as Wendy (in a black bikini); and Nita Talbot as Paula, who becomes Kolchak's gal pal.

The low points, for me, are the clunky The Knightly Murders (no pun intended), and The Chopper, which devolves into camp. Yet even those episodes have their points of charm. The final segment, The Sentry, is often reviled due to the reptilian creature costume, but it wouldve worked if the creators kept its cartoonish face & teeth obscured. The story rips-off Star Treks Devil in the Dark, but isn't anywhere near as absorbing. Yet this is partially made up for by the beaming & lovely Kathie Browne as Lt. Irene Lamont. Kathie was McGavins wife for 34 years until her death in 2003. You might recall her as hottie Deela in Star Treks Wink of an Eye from seven years earlier. Unsurprisingly, she & Darren have great chemistry.

The concept of the show, and its star (and some of the co/guest stars), are better than the actual execution of most of the episodes. The show needed someone of the caliber of Gene Roddenberry at the helm. As it turned out, the bulk of the pressure & work fell on McGavins shoulders and thus he couldn't even finish out the season. Nevertheless, the show was seminal and acquired a cult-following, influencing more popular future series like The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Supernatural and The Walking Dead.

They pointed out the contradictions in some of the stories about him, and that a lot of claims about what he did and did not do were not known for certain, and probably cant be known for certain.

There is a lot of drama, and a lot of things that don't make sense in this season which made it frustrating to watch and made me grateful for its end.  In addition to the story of the fictional characters, the use of a historical personage as Hallams best friend also became confusing because the writers seem more interested in using Prince George to forward Hallam's story rather than in depicting the truth of Prince Georges life.",1524700800,3,suppos surpris show didnt get renew two main charact show truli loathsom rest somewher likabl depress sister perci viper miser nazi intent ruin other happi husband hallam selfright prig like selfright peopl hypocrit lot drama lot thing dont make sen season made frustrat watch made grate end addit stori fiction charact use histor personag hallam best friend also becam confus writer seem interest use princ georg forward hallam stori rather depict truth princ georg life

They simply do not have the stature or the skillset he had.  The script really isn't even that strong.  It's the performance and the cinematography which will stay with you.  The energy and moral ambiguity of 1967 is fully captured in a way that is quite credible.

Now the movie and without spoilers,this is one of those movie that you would want to watch on those rainy days or late night creature feature flicks. Lots of scary scenes on this one and the actors are great starring Gary Busey and with the late Corey Haim in it along with Canadian actress Megan Follows. A good werewolf movie except the creature looks a bit more like a grizzly bear than a werewolf but then again still terrifying at best. Special effects are old school on this one during the werewolf transformation scene but this is the 80's so you'll have to be a little forgiving if you're a younger viewer. Too bad that this Blu ray did not come with a digital download cause I would have loved to have this on my mobile device to go!

43198,102,3634,"RELEASED IN 2016 and directed by Timothy Woodward Jr., ""Traded"" stars Michael Par as a father ruthlessly pursuing his runaway daughter (Brittany Elizabeth Williams) who has fallen prey to slavers in the prostitution trade. Trace Adkins plays an intimidating saloon owner while Kris Kristofferson is on hand as a bartender seeking redemption from the filth hes forced to live amidst. Tom Sizemore plays a nasty buyer in the slave-whore business.

This is a low-budget Western that has some technical weaknesses, like dubious continuity/editing, but a compelling story, gritty tone, brutal violence and fine locations, costuming & score. If you don't appreciate dark, violent modern Grade B Westerns like Hickok (2017) and 6 Guns (2010) don't bother. The plot is obviously a melding of Hardcore (1979) and Taken (2008) in the Old West, but without the blockbuster resources. There are a lot of UN-pleasant elements as we see what those saloon babes REALLY had to go through in the Old West.

There are some unexpected highlights, like Marie Oldenbourg as Girl in a meaty subplot, but the way it concludes (the subplot) is a missed opportunity. As dark and brutal as the movie is, there are thankfully brief rays of light, hope, reverence and (hopefully) happiness.

Yet it is the first movie I've seen out of dozens I've watched  in the horror/thriller genre here on Amazon
that genuinely produced a nervousness, a jumpiness, and made me want to turn on a few more lights in
my house.  It's just a guy (paranormal researcher) alone at night in a haunted house, waiting for the rest
of his crew to arrive.  Then the noises start.  A few kinetic events occur involving chairs, lights and doors,
and that's about it.  But it produces a tension that none of the slasher gore fests ever did.  I suppose it's
just so low-key and real that in a sense, it's easy to relate to.

Yes, it's a little slow at times; no, there is no final tidying up of the storyline, for there really is almost no
story, just a depiction of this guy's experience while in the house.  The house is big and old and interesting,
so gives you a lot to look at during the slow scenes.  And actually, all the ""slow"" scenes contribute to the
building of nervousness and tension, even though you might feel a bit impatient at the time.

If you only like the slasher-type movies, or ones with palpable monsters, a lot of screaming and chasing and
action (which I do watch and find entertaining if they're good), you probably won't like this, because it is
definitely tame by these standards.  But if you like just a plain, real-feeling haunted house experience every

43374,6718,365,"NIGHT FRIGHT shares an eerie half-world with a handful of similarly modest but entertaining teen horror/sci-fi entries like GIANT GILA MONSTER, HORROR OF PARTY BEACH and DEATH CURSE OF TARTU. These are an uneasy mix of happily gyrating teens and skulking horror that are a guilty weakness of mine.

The storyline is standard stuff: a spaceship sent into the icy depths of Out There by dedicated scientists runs into unchecked radiation, and the test animals aboard are mutated. The largest and nastiest promptly goes on an eating binge. The film appears for be a rehash of themes already used in the obscure DEMON FROM DEVIL'S LAKE.

Granted, Texas isn't known for astounding advances in cinema. Larry Buchannan, the fevered brow at the helm of THE EYE CREATURES, IT'S ALIVE! and ZONTAR, THE THING FROM VENUS, hailed from Texas. THE GIANT GILA MONSTER was filmed in and around Cielo. Still...

John Agar, in one of his last ""earnest man with a job to do"" roles is a somewhat peeved lawman charged with finding out what exactly is killing the locals. He does well in the limited role, providing the film's one strong performance. The other characters are broadly written and almost painfully bland. The bizarrely named Roger Ready woodenly plays a scientist who knows more than he admits (and who is largely qualified as being a researcher by way of smoking a pipe). There's also a nerdy newshound, police resenting kids, and an extremely lackluster love interest.

That said, the overall film is actually fairly enjoyable. The monster, a hulking gorilla with facial spines and a Klingon head ridge, is reasonably impressive for a regional production. The isolated locales and dim photography add a certain appeal, though the latter occasionally flashes almost starkly bright (particularly during the climax where half the hunters seem to be waiting in the dead of night and the rest in some distant land where it's high noon). The government cover-up angle is expected, and should neatly justify the suspicions of any borderline paranoids in the audience.

Great film but, taken as a simple ""googly fiend run amok"" picture, it's more than passable.",1524787200,5,night fright share eeri halfworld hand similarli modest entertain teen horrorscifi entri like giant gila monster horror parti beach death cur tartu uneasi mix happili gyrat teen skulk horror guilti weak mine storylin standard stuff spaceship sent ici depth dedic scientist run uncheck radiat test anim aboard mutat largest nastiest promptli goe eat bing film appear rehash theme alreadi use obscur demon devil lake grant texa isnt known astound advanc cinema larri buchannan fever brow helm eye creatur aliv zontar thing venu hail texa giant gila monster film around cielo still john agar one last earnest man job role somewhat peev lawman charg find exactli kill local well limit role provid film one strong perform charact broadli written almost pain bland bizarr name roger readi woodenli play scientist know admit larg qualifi research way smoke pipe there also nerdi newshound polic resent kid extrem lacklust love interest said overal film actual fairli enjoy monster hulk gorilla facial spine klingon head ridg reason impress region product isol local dim photographi add certain appeal though latter occasion flash almost starkli bright particularli climax half
43375,817,5248,"This sumptuous 1966 masterpiece, based on a novel by James Michener, pays tribute to the sacrifices made by American missionaries to Christianize 19th century Hawaii.
  Its featured theme song was later used to introduce the local CBS news on channel KGNB.I knew that tune initially in that venue before seeing this movie. Elmer Bernstein's score brilliantly and accurately captures the beauty of the tropical setting of swaying palm trees,blue ocean , and fabulous sunrises and sunsets.  The story begins with  a Yale University narration by the Prince Keoki,Manu Tupou, of Maui,who tells the Hawaiian legends interspersed with his peoples history, and problems caused by the troublesome whalers,ending with a plea for missionaries to Christianize  the islands as an antidote.  A Divinity school student named Abner Hale(, a gritty and hard nosed Max Von Sydow, fresh from playing Christ Himself in the previous year's release,The Greatest Story Ever Told,)volunteers for the mission, but we receive a foreshadowing of how his family's strict Calvanistic background will influence his treatment of those he seeks to convert.  In regards to Abner's character, one is reminded of a statement from the film, Dr. Zhivago about an equally zealous character in that story who is described as ...""The kind of man the world pretends to look up to, and in fact despises because that sort breeds unhappiness particularly in women. ""  The woman with whom he will eventually share his life is to be found in the Massachusetts city of Walpole.  The well -to -do Charles Bromley, (Carroll O' Connor) and his wife, Abigail, (Elizabeth Cole) seek a solution to the problem involving their  distaught and confused 22- year -old daughter Jerusha, (Julie Andrews,fresh from her role ad the equally religious Maria Von Trapp in The Sound of Music, )who was promised to a sea captain from whom she hasn't heared in two years. The two younger  Bromley sisters, Mercy ,(Heather Menzies, who played Andrews charge and stepdaughter in The Sound of Music), and little Charity, (Diane Sherry), join their parents in welcoming  Abner to their home to get acquainted, having been introduced by Divinity school head, Reverend Dr. Thorn (Torin Thatcher), who hides the newly arrived package of letters from the sea captain.  Abner is deeply attracted to Jerusha, but expresses his reluctance to expose  her to a level of hardships and deprivations he will face. But Jerusha is willing to accept such a life.  We are treated to Andrew's popular vocalizations only once when she performs a song called My Wishing Doll accompanied by Mercy's piano stylings.  Abner and Jerusha marry, and amid the singing of the hymn ,Blest Be the Tie That Binds,they sail for theory destination, facing a harrowing journey around the horn of South America. Even then,we see signs of how Abner's missionary zeal will be tempered by Jerusha's diplomacy and compassion for those aboard who don't always measure up to her husband's standards of Christian conduct.  In due course, they arrive on Maui at the whaling seaport city of Lahaina where despite Abner's rigid objections, Keoki jumps ship and swims over to greet his mother, Malama,(Oscar winner , Jocelene Le Garde ),who greets the missionaries warmly, admiring the Haole females she is seeing for the first time. Abner expresses apprehension when Malama insists on meeting exclusively with Jerusha only. But as a guest in someone elses country he will have to overcome his arrogance and concede to someone elses rules.  Jerusha experiences a harrowing amount of culture shock her first night there, but manages to teach Malama about writing. The hefty queen relents with her young guest when she feels she made her work too hard, and correctly guesses Jerusha is pregnant.  The Hales move into their new hut  where they find a girl named Illiki, (Lokelani S. Chicarell), who is given to them as servant. Abner vows to make her the first fruit of his ministry.  Abner begins to build a church, but finds himself at odds with locals who warn the site is unstable due to the whistling wind that blows through there when monarchs die. Abner brushes aside the advice of people who've been in that location for thousands of years.  Jerusha has a painful, distressing, and prolonged labor, during which Abner slams the hut door in Keoki's face when he tries to bring medical aid from indigenous midwives. Their son, ,Micah ,(Robert Oakley,Henrik Von Sydow, Clas Von Sydow, and Bertil Wetjfelt), is the first of their three children.
It is during Jerusha's first pregnancy that she is reunited with her former intended, Captain Rafer Hoxworth,(Richard Harris) , who is devastated by her marriage to a self- righteous missionary and warns her that their lifestyle will kill her.  Malama struggles to accept Christianity, particularly ,having to put aside her incestuous relationship with her brother Kelolo, (Ted Norbriga), and while Abner gloats when she finally relents, the pattern of Jerusha's being the heart of the mission counterbalancing Abner's frequent bullheadedness continues when she expresses empathy towards Malama's having made such a difficult choice.  Malama raises continuous objections to settlers taking over too much of the Hawaiian's land.  But at best ,the missionaries also see that laws are passed against formication,in view of the vast number of Hawaiian girls who contracted venrereal diseases from sailors, and they establish a home for unwanted children.  A member of the missionary society ousted for marrying the Hawaiian woman who tended to his  previous wife when she died in childbirth and tended to the baby. He is glad to leave, as he is self sufficient and tired of their hypocrisy.  Abner's smug refusal to ordain Keoki will have tragic results as well.

It runs for 2 hours and 28 minutes and every minute is captivating, bizarre at times, and the soundtrack is mesmerizing.  It had the humorous moments like Quentin Tarantino is known for.

What I do empathize with is how his parents tip-toed around every moment of a possible outburst or lapse. The story itself needs no description; just watch the movie. The revelation is Jennifer Lawrence, her self, challenged, emotionally at least, and conveying such with the various early encounters between them. One riveting scene is their conversation in the diner: those who appreciate the topic she was ""opening up to him with"" will recognize its significance.

43498,2172,5296,"This is a big time Hollywood history movie like they used to make. There are some really terrific scenes, especially the battle of Gaugamela which gives us a birdseye view of how massive this fight was. Alexander was outnumbered by the huge Persian army, but his military skills are on full display here. That scene alone is worth watching the movie.

Unfortunately there are parts of the movie that slow the pacing way down. Alexander conquered about 90 percent of the known world by the age of 32, but this movie develops a soap opera feel and leaves his military adventures behind. And that was a mistake. More examples of his actual military accomplishments would have been more interesting than his weird relationship with his mother.

The soundtrack by Vangelis works well, especially the battle music. It's unique and should hold up with time.

There are many reviewers who are clearly uncomfortable that Alexander was probably bisexual. It is a fact that his lifelong friend Hephaestion was his closest adviser, and when he died, Alexanders life collapsed. True, there are no cell phone pictures of Alexander and Hephaestion having sex, but let's be honest. Same sex relationships among the Greeks at that time was well known and not that big of a deal. The thought of Alexander being bisexual should not distract from the reality that he was one of the greatest military leaders of all time.

Putting aside the awful blond wig and a silly accent, Colin Farrell does a commendable job in the lead. Alexander was not just a conqueror and lover, but someone who valued culture and history. Farrell is believable in the role.

43500,2812,2273,"We thoroughly enjoyed The Lost World; however, if you are looking for the megabudget CGI spectaculars of the 21st century, your mileage may vary.

Released the year before Jurassic Park came out and caused a revolution in CGI rendering of dinosaurs, The Lost World depends mostly on puppets and superlative actors to deliver the story originally written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  It definitely does not disappoint.

John Rhys-Davies is his usual A-list boisterous best, combining humor with determination in the type of role where he excels.  David Warner's presentation of Professor Summerlee's character transition from nasty curmudgeon to supportive True Believer, at least when it comes to Prof. Challenger's dinosaurs, makes the story leap right off the page.

Alas for Gladys Hungerton; she plays a key role in the book as the motivation for Edward Malone to want to go off on an adventure and ""prove himself,"" but she does not appear in the movie.  Fans of Doyle's written work will see her presence implied by Malone's desire for such an adventure, but the film does not show the motivation for this peculiar goal.  We do, however, get remarkably beautiful Tamara Gorski's brilliant portrayal of Jenny Nielson, the wildlife photographer whose daddy ends up funding the whole expedition to The Lost World.",1524873600,5,thoroughli enjoy lost world howev look megabudget cgi spectacular 21st centuri mileag may vari releas year jurass park came caus revolut cgi render dinosaur lost world depend mostli puppet superl actor deliv stori origin written sir arthur conan doyl definit disappoint john rhysdavi usual alist boister best combin humor determin type role excel david warner present professor summerle charact transit nasti curmudgeon support true believ least come prof challeng dinosaur make stori leap right page ala gladi hungerton play key role book motiv edward malon want go adventur prove appear movi fan doyl written work see presenc impli malon desir adventur film show motiv peculiar goal howev get remark beauti tamara gorski brilliant portray jenni nielson wildlif photograph whose daddi end fund whole expedit lost world

43505,5567,5233,"This is a movie that is completely over the top. The character Fiorentino plays is as evil a woman as there is. She uses her feminine wiles and hard personality to mesmerize, seduce and destroy her husband and her paramour. I felt sorry for them!

Fiorentino absconds with a $700,000 batch of cash that her husband scored doing a drug deal. He hires an African-American P.I. to track her down but Fiorentino dupes and destroys the hapless fellow by crashing her car and using the local racism to her advantage thus quashing any potential in depth investigation. In the small town of Beston, New York, she seduces a fellow and tricks him into murdering her husband. But the plan goes wrong and the innocent dupe is in the end arrested for murder and rape.

Wow! Roger Ebert said: ""The last Seduction is about the way even a smart guy gets dumb when he starts thinking tumescently."" It's true! It's sad what happened to this man (Played Well By Peter Berg). This lady makes Barbara Stanwyck (Double Indemnity) look like a virgin. even the character from Body Heat is second best compared to the on Linda Fiorentino played. She is absolute evil. she wins in the end and has all the money to herself. However, I wonder if she would ever feel free enough to love another man. I don't think she would. In the end my guess is she would be alone for the rest of her life. but then again, being alone with $700,000 tax free ain't such a bad thing. She'd certainly have her pick of males at her feet and the money would give her the freedom to do almost whatever she wanted.

I give this film Four Stars. It's very good. It tends to drag a bit towards the end (After Bill Nunn's Character Is Slain) but it's still enjoyable. I'm the 104th person to Review this film.

43523,1867,487,"I am a punk and I like movies, especially horror. So it seemed natural this film, that combines both, would be a no-brainer, but that's not necessarily the case with things. I'm from New Jersey but I didn't like Garden State. Green Room is a punk horror film, and it delivers. From early on in the movie, the suspense begins and is quickly relieved, which shows just how masterful this film is and how in control the filmmakers are. You're in for a treat and a ride.

A punk band low on money and just about desperate agree to take a gig that pays a guaranteed amount at a remote venue, which as they find out has a definite neo-Nazi skinhead hardcore bent. They play ""Nazi Punks F--- Off!"" by Dead Kennedys as their first song, and if you aren't familiar with this song, check out the lyrics. This sets the stage for antagonism & tension, but things really go off the deep end when a bandmember stumbles upon something heavy that happens. That's all I'll say. The rest is purely masterful in the way great horror is.

The tension and suspense is so heavy and the violence so brutal that at one point I got a stomach ache, which was a good sign to remind me I'm alive and that something important is happening onscreen.

I was a little skeptical at first of the film for how accurate it would get punk culture -- or would it caricature it? -- but it knows about what it wrote about. I have to say, tho, that for a movie to hold interest, something has to happen, something pretty heavy (which does); most punk shows I've been to have been completely safe, fun, anarchistic events full of mutual support and joyfulness. Don't go into this film not knowing about punk culture and think it's really like this. It's a movie. Something engaging has to happen. The closest I came to the scenario in this film is a lone skinhead at an Agent Orange show. Punks are generally really good people, like the protagonist band.

There is, however, a dark side (like with anything) in the punk world -- the neo-Nazi element in hardcore music -- and it's this dark side that the film delves into so well. For a movie mostly taking place in one location, it has zero trappings of low budget-ness or anemia: it's gripping & meaty from the opening scene to the last, and there are some very powerful images in this movie, such as a pit bull wandering around dragging its own chain leash. The color green, often thought of as relaxing/natural, is used to counterpoint the hellacious events that unfold.

I also think the treatment of good guys/bad guys is nuanced and intelligent -- the neo-Nazis have dimension and even almost pathos (especially Imogen Poots' character), while the good guys aren't exactly squeaky clean. In a time where the so-called alt-right has come out of the woodwork politically and culturally, this is actually a really important film and not just an effective horror film that *happens* to be set at a punk club.

Patrick Stewart does a great job, the equivalent of the neo-Nazi mastermind in American History X, and both films show the hierarchy (and even bureaucracy!) of white supremacist groups. One minor flaw is that a free happy hour lasting two hours would never happen, because punks would drink a ridiculous amount in that time and even crazier shit would happen.

Some people like their horror to be set in contemporary times and be plausible: this is both. Nothing supernatural, just the horror of human politics and people in desperate situations. But for a relatively simple plot, this movie is meaty, tastefully gory, and engaging. This is horror as it should be: visceral yet cerebral, violent without being OTT, realistic, and showing how the wrong decision in life can open up a can of worms like opening Hell itself.

43577,5567,5240,"This is a movie that is completely over the top. The character Fiorentino plays is as evil a woman as there is. She uses her feminine wiles and hard personality to mesmerize, seduce and destroy her husband and her paramour. I felt sorry for them!

Fiorentino absconds with a $700,000 batch of cash that her husband scored doing a drug deal. He hires an African-American P.I. to track her down but Fiorentino dupes and destroys the hapless fellow by crashing her car and using the local racism to her advantage thus quashing any potential in depth investigation. In the small town of Beston, New York, she seduces a fellow and tricks him into murdering her husband. But the plan goes wrong and the innocent dupe is in the end arrested for murder and rape.

Wow! Roger Ebert said: ""The last Seduction is about the way even a smart guy gets dumb when he starts thinking tumescently."" It's true! It's sad what happened to this man (Played Well By Peter Berg). This lady makes Barbara Stanwyck (Double Indemnity) look like a virgin. even the character from Body Heat is second best compared to the on Linda Fiorentino played. She is absolute evil. she wins in the end and has all the money to herself. However, I wonder if she would ever feel free enough to love another man. I don't think she would. In the end my guess is she would be alone for the rest of her life. but then again, being alone with $700,000 tax free ain't such a bad thing. She'd certainly have her pick of males at her feet and the money would give her the freedom to do almost whatever she wanted.

I give this film Four Stars. It's very good. It tends to drag a bit towards the end (After Bill Nunn's Character Is Slain) but it's still enjoyable. I'm the 104th person to Review this film.

A perfectly normal family outing turns into a horror showdown - and the mysterious 'Lady Ghost' cleverly uses both father and son (and pits them against each other) in order to seal everyone's fate. To me it had elements of the tale of the Lorelei; it's something like that, and I was impressed because it had a storyline that showcased both supernatural and 'blood-and-guts' elements. It didn't drag, like some of the other Euro-movies I've seen here. The Netherlands is right next to France, so I was sort of expecting another 'Forest of Demons' disaster but that wasn't the case at all.

The most perplexing part of this movie is when Evelyn Salt's handler shows up at the CIA's masquerading office and outs his Russian protege, Salt. This sets the stage for the CIA to hunt Salt for the rest of this film. The underlying premise of this film is reminiscent of the first season of Alias (watch it). Key takeaways that are outstanding include Salt's MacGyverish use of a fire extinguisher to make an improvised RPG, a face mask, and stunts (i.e. scaling the outside walls of an apartment complex barefoot and jumping from semi-truck to semi-truck).

Greedy Americans contaminating local waters which caused a massive bacterial outbreak ironically on the 4th July. Idiot American citizens call in the local radio station making the usual idiotic American claims of terrorism and satanic cults. It was like some film student was charged up on their newly found anti-Americanism and so eager to express it that they spewed it out in an uncontrollable stream. It was the exact opposite of the great found footage film ""The Blair Witch Project"" whose genius, in my opinion, was the authenticity of the characters. They were believable and familiar, which is crucial to a found footage film. The true irony of ""The Bay"" is that the movie itself is based on wild conspiracy theories, which the movie, ironically makes fun of. In modern America you are much more likely to hear conspiracy theories about Russia, water contamination, Israel and Christians than you are terrorism or satanic cults. If you look around the world in the last decade, where are you going to find water contamination due to human causes? It certainly won't be in the US.

How he developed his musical talents is not really explained but the music will appeal to anyone who likes early jazz (and especially ragtime, both Gershwin and Joplin style)). The lead actor, Tim Roth, seems perfect for his role (with some real skill on the piano) and the settings many other production values are very strong.  Except for a few quirky characters that - for reasons unknown - Italian-made movies simply must include, most of the story is almost realistic enough to be believable.

43655,1149,1839,"I really liked this movie. I wasn't expecting much because I've seen so many ""ghosthunters investigating a haunted house"" movies that aren't well done, that it surprises me when I come across one that is a good movie.  This one had a pretty good story, plenty of scary scenes, and one I didn't know how it would turn out in the end. Don't get me wrong, though, it did have some of the same characters that do stupid things in movies, like why would you be so dumb as to go outside of the protective circle when you know your life is in danger and that everything you'd seen so far, was not what it seemed? One of the persons in particular, who should have known better, fell for that trick, that surprised me a bit. But I guess we can't always have people who do things right in these movies, or they'd all be kind of boring, wouldn't they?  But I do have to say, this movie is worth your time to watch, so sit back, try to relax, and keep the lights on while you watch it.",1524873600,4,realli like movi wasnt expect much ive seen mani ghosthunt investig haunt hous movi arent well done surpris come across one good movi one pretti good stori plenti scari scene one didnt know would turn end dont get wrong though charact stupid thing movi like would dumb go outsid protect circl know life danger everyth youd seen far seem one person particular known better fell trick surpris bit guess cant alway peopl thing right movi theyd kind bore wouldnt say movi worth time watch sit back tri relax keep light watch

43699,2118,2578,"House Complete Collection

Gregory House MD is a modern version of Sherlock Holmes, a character who is shown to be most observant and knowledgeable than his co-workers. The camera is the Dr. Watson to record the events. The location is the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Everybody lies is his slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned the business). Would his temper tantrums fly in the real world? Would his pill popping also be acceptable? [A nurse once told me she hated this show because it was so false to what she saw in her workplace. I told her Hollywood makes drama and entertainment, fictional reality.] This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflicts. Is that its attraction? There is a recurring plot. A patient arrives at a hospital. There are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem and the cure.

Watching this show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on the radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half-truths to promote an agenda that they are being paid to do? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a doctors mistake? [These figures are not readily available.] For comparison there are about 31,000 deaths each year in 1994 from firearms in this country (about 1 in 10,000). Before the 1968 Federal Gun Control Law this figure was only half. Motor vehicle deaths are much higher (there are more of them in use every day). The actual rate is more informative than a simple count.
This Complete Collection has all 8 Seasons with 177 episodes. Dr. Kildare by Max Brand must be the original story about hospital drama. Andrew Holtz wrote a book about The Medical Science of House MD but this referenced the first two seasons.",1524873600,5,hous complet collect gregori hous md modern version sherlock holm charact shown observ knowledg cowork camera dr watson record event locat princeton plainsboro teach hospit new jersey everybodi lie slogan hous act wish own busi would temper tantrum fli real world would pill pop also accept nurs told hate show fals saw workplac told hollywood make drama entertain fiction realiti show high amount drama person conflict attract recur plot patient arriv hospit conflict diagnosi final dr hous correctli diagnos problem cure watch show substitut see doctor problem import lesson problem cannot solv correctli diagnos think read opinion newspap hear opinion radio televis realli know theyr talk put lie halftruth promot agenda paid mani peopl die yearli mistak prescript mani peopl die year doctor mistak figur readili avail comparison 31000 death year 1994 firearm countri 1 10000 1968 feder gun control law figur half motor vehicl death much higher

43742,2202,838,"I envy anyone who watches LOST for the first time. Simply put, it's probably the most supsensful psychological thriller/mystery ever created for television.

The series debuted in September of 2004 (14 years ago from the time of this review). In my opinion, nothing else on TV has EVER come close to the quality and complexity of this series.

The first three seasons are of such a high quality that part of your enjoyment will come from sheer bewilderment that such amazing storytelling is even possible. The quality of writing, acting, and directing is unsurpassed. Honestly, you'll find yourself in utter amazement or disbelief at the end of many episodes.

Everywhere you look on TV today you'll find aspects being borrowed from the LOST playbook. Whether it was the twist endings or connected subplots found in some episodes of Breaking Bad, or the mystery and elements of isolation in The 100 or the first two seasons of The Arrow. You can trace it all back to LOST.

Also, a TV series having an online presence is common today, but the extent of LOST's foreay into cyberspace at the time was unheard of. Online forums were filled with THOUSANDS of theories concerning LOST's plotline. The producers even set up websites designed to compliment certain fictitious plot elements. There had never been a more dedicated or consistently active group of online fans.

This is an amazing season.

43854,2202,895,"Some viewers complained there was a lack of action in season three and not enough solutions to the ever growing stockpile of mysteries. I strongly disagree. In fact, this season builds on what LOST did better than any other series, it delved deeper into an intellectual adventure. The rewards of this season come from character depth, quality of writing, acting, plot structure, and a mystery that won't quit. Perhaps this season (in particular) was a bit too ""smart"" for television.

I refer to this as ""The last great season of LOST"" because season four unfortunately introduces several cliche'd plot devices and characters, seemingly to add a sense of ""action"" to the series. There's a lot to enjoy about season four, but it's where LOST loses it. This season was broadcast in 2006, the same year that LOST won a Golden Globe Award for best television drama.

I honestly believe that many viewers could simply stop watching at the end of this season. The ending is mind blowing and leaves your imagination to wander and contemplate so many amazing possibilities. If you continue on to season four you're going to be hit between the eyes with comic book styled schmaltz. A truly horrible fall from the intellectual high of season three.

I highly recommend the first three seasons of LOST.",1524960000,5,viewer complain lack action season three enough solut ever grow stockpil mysteri strongli disagre fact season build lost better seri delv deeper intellectu adventur reward season come charact depth qualiti write act plot structur mysteri wont quit perhap season particular bit smart televis refer last great season lost season four unfortun introduc sever clich plot devic charact seemingli add sen action seri there lot enjoy season four lost lose season broadcast 2006 year lost golden globe award best televis drama honestli believ mani viewer could simpli stop watch end season end mind blow leav imagin wander contempl mani amaz possibl continu season four your go hit eye comic book style schmaltz truli horribl fall intellectu high season three highli recommend first three season lost

43884,2323,4742,"I had heard quite a bit about this movie before seeing it on home video, most of it bad. The film's director Uwe Boll has achieved cult-like status in Hollywood for his horrible editing skills. After having seen many of his other movies I would say that reputation is well-deserved. However, In the Name of the King happens to be an exception to his usual, forgettable movies, IMHO.

First of all, unlike most of his films, this one actually had a real budget of over $60 million. That's no chump change, even in Hollywood. It was enough money to have bought the services of several excellent actors, some not-so-horrible CGI effects and a screenplay that at least sounded as if the writer was a native speaker of the English language. Granted, some of the lines in the movie are pretty stupid, but they at least make some kind of grammatical sense, which is not usually the case in most of Boll's movies.

The movie plot is based upon a video game, which seems to be the case with many of Uwe Boll's movies. Personally, I don't really like video games, especially ones based on a flakey sci-fi premise. So, getting me to enjoy this film was an uphill battle to begin with. I can't say as the screenplay was that good. On the other hand, the casting was absolutely ridiculous. I can definitely buy Statham in the main role, which he does a pretty good job with. Burt Reynolds as the king was just a stupid idea though as was Liotta's role. Most of the cast did a pretty good job with what they had to work with though.

 I honestly did not find the direction in this film all that bad. There were definitely a lot of corners cut in the editing process, but nothing to be a deal breaker insofar as its entertainment value. At least Boll's direction is somewhat original, unlike most of the crappy commercial films that land on home video these days. The effects are quite a bit over-the-top at times, but what can you expect when you are watching a fantasy film with mythical creatures, magic and mystical powers? I've seen a hell of a lot worse in the Sharnado franchise, and I still enjoy those films.

At worst, this is a pretty harmless but at least watchable 90 minute fantasy flick. At best, well, it is one of Uwe Boll's least worst movies. If Boll had released this with no credit attributed to himself and no one knew who the director was, this film would never receive the horrible reviews that you will see of this movie on IMDB. I think that a lot of the bad reviews are just trolling Uwe Boll because he is one of the most hated directors in Hollywood. Honestly, this movie is not horrible and is just entertaining enough to sit through.",1524960000,3,heard quit bit movi see home video bad film director uwe boll achiev cultlik statu hollywood horribl edit skill seen mani movi would say reput welldeserv howev name king happen except usual forgett movi imho first unlik film one actual real budget 60 million that chump chang even hollywood enough money bought servic sever excel actor notsohorr cgi effect screenplay least sound writer nativ speaker english languag grant line movi pretti stupid least make kind grammat sen usual case boll movi movi plot base upon video game seem case mani uwe boll movi person dont realli like video game especi one base flakey scifi premis get enjoy film uphil battl begin cant say screenplay good hand cast absolut ridicul definit buy statham main role pretti good job burt reynold king stupid idea though liotta role cast pretti good job work though honestli find direct film bad definit lot corner cut

43899,2262,4581,"1983's ""Microwave Massacre"" is obviously an even lower-budget attempt to capitalize on the popularity of 1982's low-budget hit ""Eating Raoul,"" which became something of a cult classic.

No, this isn't horror.  ""Microwave Massacre"" is supposed to be a comedy with a little blood and nudity...but they skimped on the comedy.  Like low-end pornography without the porn.  About the same level of writing, acting, directing and cinematography as cheesy porn.

Donald is a middle-aged construction worker who feels trapped in a marriage to his compulsive-housekeeper wife May, and they haven't had sex in 15 years.  Donald finally snaps one night, beats May to death with a salt-grinder and later chops her up for the deep freeze.  After accidentally ingesting a few bites of May's arm, Donald finds that he has a taste for human flesh; he then goes on a dismal spree of bringing women home for sex and then dismembering them for the freezer.

And so on.

It's too lame to be horror and too badly-written to be comedy, so it drifts in the nether-realm of bad movies that are amused with themselves, but that leave the audience cold, so to speak.

The enormous microwave prop plays almost no part in the story, aside from a couple of significant shots, so the title of the film is more than a little misleading, too.",1524960000,1,1983 microwav massacr obvious even lowerbudget attempt capit popular 1982 lowbudget hit eat raoul becam someth cult classic isnt horror microwav massacr suppos comedi littl blood nuditybut skimp comedi like lowend pornographi without porn level write act direct cinematographi cheesi porn donald middleag construct worker feel trap marriag compulsivehousekeep wife may havent sex 15 year donald final snap one night beat may death saltgrind later chop deep freez accident ingest bite may arm donald find tast human flesh goe dismal spree bring woman home sex dismemb freezer lame horror badlywritten comedi drift netherrealm bad movi amus leav audienc cold speak enorm microwav prop play almost part stori asid coupl signific shot titl film littl mislead

43983,3195,3741,"I'm glad I read the review that mentioned this film was Twilight  Zonesque! It made the really bad acting from all three co-stars tolerable, appearing reminiscint of the stiff, soundstage performances from that show, of which I saw every single episode .....live!

The story moved right along, and I was not bored at all.
 It was a very clever script, co-written by Shawn Christensen. Actually, for a movie whos entire cast is only 4 actors, it has to be a DAMN good script to overcome their inexperience.

Christensen put together one of my favorite movies, ""Before I Disappear."" Christensen wrote, starred, directed, and his band did some of the music in that film.

Katherine Waterston and Sarah Paxton both need a LOT of work.

Waterston has quite an impressive resume of what must have been small roles in some notable films, but again these young women.........

I'm not sure about the German guy. It was hard to tell how well he delivered his lines. He didn't speak English, but I think he just might have been the best of the four.

I saw Scott Eastwood when he starred in ""The Longest Ride"" in 2015. Ohhh, it was not good.

I was desperate and rented it on Pay Per View, not expecting very much. There was just a limited synopsis, and it was a bit shocking to see Clint's clone show up!

For those of us who remember the TV show, ""Rawhide"" from the sixties, Scott looks exactly like a young Clint!

In the trivia here, on Scott's birth certificate, it says, ""Father declined"" I've read Clint was a real lothario.

There are a few stars that cannot act, who have been lucky enough to have long careers, and their acting has never improved. Rock Hudson comes to mind. It's kind of remarkable, with ALL the movies Hudson was in, that it didn't improve just by accident!  Keanu Reeves should thank God every day, twice a day!  Clint Eastwood is not as bad, but another one. HE had been a stuntman, and did all his own stunts in the ""Dirty Harry"" films that were UNBELIEVABLE.

As he got older, he learned how to rely on his famous scowl, and  gruff voice that covered a lot.
He and Ben Affleck were smart to learn to direct. They could call the shots and surround themselves with great actors so their modest abilities were not as noticeable. And of course, Clint is one of our best directors.

I'm thinking maybe Scott should  spend as much time with his dad as possible BEHIND the camera. It might be his strength, too.",1524960000,3,im glad read review mention film twilight zonesqu made realli bad act three costar toler appear reminiscint stiff soundstag perform show saw everi singl episod live stori move right along bore clever script cowritten shawn christensen actual movi who entir cast 4 actor damn good script overcom inexperi christensen put togeth one favorit movi disappear christensen wrote star direct band music film katherin waterston sarah paxton need lot work waterston quit impress resum must small role notabl film young woman im sure german guy hard tell well deliv line didnt speak english think might best four saw scott eastwood star longest ride 2015 ohhh good desper rent pay per view expect much limit synopsi bit shock see clint clone show u rememb tv show rawhid sixti scott look exactli like young clint trivia scott birth certif say father declin ive read clint real lothario star cannot act lucki enough long career act never improv rock hudson come mind kind

It is a sad tale, and as Batman is already a dark and brooding character, this film gives you some insight into the added grief he carries with him.

My only gripe with this film, once again, is the voice casting.  It took me several views to get used to the voice of Batman and the Joker.  Some fans have complained about the voice choice of Nightwing, whom I found a balancing comic relief.  The aforementioned two, however, Joker sounded like he was just getting over a cold, and Batman....I don't know.

But most of all, sadness as to the inexcusable, uneducable, desperate, and overpowering stupidity of the people who voted for Obama.  It was, for them, the ultimate act of masochism.

Particularly sad is to watch them admit their stupidity on film, and then admit that they refuse to cure it:  That they will, indeed, continue to vote Democrat even when they have seen that Democrat doctrine and policy is poison.

In this film, Gilbert uses the analogy of the *Wizard of Oz* as a parable illustrating the campaign and presidency of Barack Obama, and the effect on those dumb enough to believe that this obvious con was The Messiah.

44081,3434,1151,"This movie series completely caught me off-guard. I saw that Hallmark was airing a marathon and figured I'd give it a try, but was also mentally planning on getting a bunch of housework done because I figured it would bore me. So much for that -- I was hooked by the first commercial break! I don't know if it's because this is from 2008, so Hallmark had a different production style back then, or it's just something unique to these movies because they're about a ""witch"" (more on what that means here later), but this was so different and good compared to a lot of their movies.

How? This series combines several appealing themes: A fish out of water finding a sense of community in a small town (OK, that's not so unique for Hallmark); a ""Sound of Music""-esque romance with a widowed father (neither is that); and a good dose of mystery and intrigue with the whole witch thing. Is Cassie really a witch, or just a very mysterious, intuitive woman with a black cat who happens to like essential oils and live in an old manor? I can see why Hallmark was vague about her witchiness (so as not to offend some people), but it also adds a new layer of intrigue to the show. And the lessons each movie teaches about forgiveness and not rushing to judgment are really lovely. Seriously. I mean, maybe it's a little naive to (SPOILER, sort of) make the villain almost always turn out to  be someone who's really good deep down and changes their ways once Cassie has a talk with them. But it's nice to see, and, as weird as this may sound, has made me even think about my own life and how I would treat someone in similar situations. Who'da thought Hallmark's series about a witch would be its most heartwarming?

I also really like the cast. Catherine Bell is lovely as Cassie, capturing this unique blend of mysterious-yet-warmhearted; the police chief/love interest has great chemistry with her; and his daughter is such a cutie. As with many of these shows that take place in a small town, the annoying busybody who's ultimately harmless (the mayor's wife, Martha) adds a layer of tension that's somewhat funny without being too dark or depressing. However, I'll also say that it's nice how this show doesn't gloss over some of the unpleasantries of life, like how there's a homeless alcoholic, characters who are genuinely hostile towards Cassie at first, others who are being abused by loved ones, etc.",1525046400,5,movi seri complet caught offguard saw hallmark air marathon figur id give tri also mental plan get bunch housework done figur would bore much hook first commerci break dont know 2008 hallmark differ product style back someth uniqu movi theyr witch mean later differ good compar lot movi seri combin sever appeal theme fish water find sen commun small town ok that uniqu hallmark sound musicesqu romanc widow father neither good dose mysteri intrigu whole witch thing cassi realli witch mysteri intuit woman black cat happen like essenti oil live old manor see hallmark vagu witchi offend peopl also add new layer intrigu show lesson movi teach forgiv rush judgment realli love serious mean mayb littl naiv spoiler sort make villain almost alway turn someon who realli good deep chang way cassi talk nice see weird may sound made even think life would treat someon similar situat

44099,5437,1510,"I watched this movie all the way through.  It started out as you'd expect from a low-budget indie movie: bad acting (though I've definitely seen much worse), sub-par sound & cinematography.  The thing that held me for a while was the lead character, a paranormal investigator who comes across as professional, well-grounded and likable.  The other characters are fairly normal and not obnoxious, so they are likable as well.  Except for the ""Christian"", who is portrayed in the usual stereotypical way, and is not likable (have you noticed that only Christians--and white males, for that matter-- are the only groups which it is still politically correct to dump on unreservedly?)  Anyway, like I said, the film starts out bearably enough, because the approach is more clinical than is usually seen in this type film.  They set up shop in a house (nice, plain suburban home--no spooky points for setting) where a family was murdered some years before.  Through several nights they document various ghostly, supernatural occurrences, which ultimately reveal what actually happened in the house all those years ago.

And here the film degenerates into really bottom-of-the-barrel mode.  A few more actors are introduced (in flashbacks revealing what happened all those years ago), and they are pitifully bad.  The story is one you guessed from the very beginning (but hoped maybe they'd come up with something different, and thus surprise you, but didn't).  So the story ended up holding no surprises, and you've just sat through some abysmal acting and lame, well-worn scenarios for nothing.  Don't make the mistake I did, by watching the whole thing.

Hardly any gore, no real sex (just a suggestion once), minimal bad language, actually some brief nudity (boob shots).

44146,580,1282,"William Friedkin made two truly great films in The Exorcist and The French Connection. This is the latter and it still captures your attention. Two police detectives must tail drug lords in New York. While it is certainly slow to start, The French Connection is filled with intrigue to engage the audience as you piece together the operation and do the detective work along side the heroes. The French Connection pulls no punches showing the mundane to the marvelous in police work. You will never forget The French Connection.

Friedkin's direction is absolutely incredible. The car chase sequence is the often called the greatest in cinema history and I must agree. It's fast paced and thrilling. To The French Connection's merit, the entire sequence with both detectives following the criminals around the streets of New York is equally as thrilling and creatively filmed as the action sequences. Whether you are just watching someone walk down a hall to running down crooks, every scene is shot perfectly. It is top tier direction throughout The French Connection.

The acting is exceptional from both leading men. Gene Hackman gives one of his most intense and intimidating performances of his impressive career, while Roy Scheider scales back his role to realistic gloom and professionalism. They are the perfect foil for each other. Hackman's bombastic ""Popeye"" character is desperate to catch the criminals and so he is willing to lay down the law with a gritty harshness. Scheider's cop character ""Cloudy"" is more relaxed, but equally devoted to his duty as he sticks by his partner to solve the case. Two stellar performances enhanced by each other's determination and supporting aspects. Hackman and Scheider are as great actors that deliver splendid shows of artistry.

The part I think has not held up from The French Connection is the minimalist score that sounds quite ugly and ill fitted. There are tense moments without any music at all that work so well. Then there are the numerous instances where the awfully dated score chimes in to ruin the suspense. It is too little and too abrasive for this movie's more reserved tone. Friedkin should have had someone else score The French Connection.

In short, I recommend everyone watch The French Connection for its excellent acting, complex plot, believable writing, thrilling chase sequences, suspense shoot outs, beautiful direction, and creative cinematography. It is quite a slow burn, but its flames flare up as you go along for the ride. I give The French Connection a fantastic 4.5 stars out of 5 stars.",1525046400,4,william friedkin made two truli great film exorcist french connect latter still captur attent two polic detect must tail drug lord new york certainli slow start french connect fill intrigu engag audienc piec togeth oper detect work along side hero french connect pull punch show mundan marvel polic work never forget french connect friedkin direct absolut incred car chase sequenc often call greatest cinema histori must agre fast pace thrill french connect merit entir sequenc detect follow crimin around street new york equal thrill creativ film action sequenc whether watch someon walk hall run crook everi scene shot perfectli top tier direct throughout french connect act except lead men gene hackman give one intens intimid perform impress career roy scheider scale back role realist gloom profession perfect foil hackman bombast popey charact desper catch crimin will lay law gritti harsh scheider cop charact cloudi relax equal devot duti stick partner solv case two stellar perform enhanc other determin support aspect hackman scheider great actor deliv splendid show artistri part think held french

These TV films from 1960 are based on the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner. The original books are more complete and informative and tell stories about life that is unknown to most people. The books can tell you why certain things are done, the films only show you what happened. The books tell you about ropers, rough or smooth shadows, and how to evade surveillance and avoid leaving a back trail. Some may question the legality and ethics of Perry Masons tactics but most stories were written before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The backgrounds tell about life in Los Angeles. It is difficult to film a scene at night but easy to describe it in a book. Erle Stanley Gardner was the founder of the ""Court of Last Resort"" which sought to free many unjustly convicted persons. Gardner, among others, sought to use scientific means to find the guilty, rather than using hunches or guesses alone.

Often the original stories were modified for TV. The theme music is typical for the late 1950s. Note the style of clothing and culture; ladies wore white gloves. People seldom lock their doors. The prices date these films. One advantage is seeing the many automobiles from that era. How many can you identify? Note the slimness of people, the smoking, and the familiarity with pistols. The seeming reality of these stories is due in part to characters who don't look like Hollywood actors. Watch how the actors express their emotions by their facial expressions. The camera sharpness and quality is excellent on these films.. There is nothing like these dramatic stories on todays broadcast TV. When was the last time you saw a trial lawyer as a hero? These stories often use the misinterpretation of circumstantial evidence to provide dramatic effects. The courtroom scenes, usually the Preliminary Hearings, often tell about the law. The individual season reviews contain more details.",1525132800,5,perri mason season 1 3 tv film 1960 base novel erl stanley gardner origin book complet inform tell stori life unknown peopl book tell certain thing done film show happen book tell roper rough smooth shadow evad surveil avoid leav back trail may question legal ethic perri mason tactic stori written modern legal rule 1960 background tell life lo angel difficult film scene night easi describ book erl stanley gardner founder court last resort sought free mani unjustli convict person gardner among other sought use scientif mean find guilti rather use hunch guess alon often origin stori modifi tv theme music typic late 1950 note style cloth cultur ladi wore white glove peopl seldom lock door price date film one advantag see mani automobil era mani identifi note slim peopl smoke familiar pistol seem realiti stori due part charact dont look like hollywood actor watch actor express emot facial express camera sharp qualiti excel film noth like dramat stori today broadcast tv last time saw trial lawyer hero stori often use misinterpret circumstanti

44179,2525,3662,"Though the storyline sounds scary  Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), a gorgeous Orca trainer loses both legs in a freak accident  its mostly tender, sexy and disarmingly honest.  Left in a major depression, following the ordeal, apart from standard physical rehabilitation, Stephanie receives some terrific sexual rehab at the hands, et al, of the hunky kick boxer Alain (Matthias Schoenaerts). There is a bit of violence, but mainly related to Alains boxing. The 2 leads are amazing, and when the camera fixes on their faces for a few seconds longer than usual, every nuanced tiny movement, or sustained one, rings true. And, I must confess, if some sequence of events in a film feels unnatural, I tend to sniff it out like bad oil. Heres an example of how the attention to detail doesnt skip a beat: Stephanie, in her depressed state, wears the same top, and it smells.  Shes not suddenly seen in a bunch of different ones. Her friend sorts tops out with her, and then shes viewed in different attire- a small detail, but in such a dark mind-state, it would take a buddy, just to help with the basics. The lead characters are not one-dimensional; they're bodied out, and they screw up. Alains 5-year-old son, Sam, is well-played by Armand Verdure.  Acting is solid across the board.  Direction by Jacques Audiard is pretty flawless. The screenplay is excellent, co-written by Audiard and Thomas Bidegain, from Craig Davidsons story.  Stephane Fontaines cinematography, coupled with Juliette Welflings editing, is top-notch, as is Desplats music. All filmmaking disciplines work. I hesitated a couple of days to view the film, pretty fearful of what happens to this great girl, but don't miss it. Its edifying, enlightening, pleasing, sexy, and not sappy. In someone elses hands, a tear-jerky approach might have been employed as leverage, though there are a couple of scenes that will elicit tears. Its a good one, with considerable awards and nominations to its credit.",1525132800,5,though storylin sound scari stephani marion cotillard gorgeou orca trainer lose leg freak accid mostli tender sexi disarmingli honest left major depress follow ordeal apart standard physic rehabilit stephani receiv terrif sexual rehab hand et al hunki kick boxer alain matthia schoenaert bit violenc mainli relat alain box 2 lead amaz camera fix face second longer usual everi nuanc tini movement sustain one ring true must confess sequenc event film feel unnatur tend sniff like bad oil here exampl attent detail doesnt skip beat stephani depress state wear top smell she suddenli seen bunch differ one friend sort top she view differ attir small detail dark mindstat would take buddi help basic lead charact onedimension theyr bodi screw alain 5yearold son sam wellplay armand verdur act solid across board direct jacqu audiard pretti flawless screenplay excel cowritten audiard thoma bidegain craig davidson stori stephan fontain cinematographi coupl juliett welfl edit topnotch desplat music filmmak disciplin work hesit coupl day view film pretti fear happen great girl dont miss edifi enlighten plea sexi sappi someon el hand tearjerki approach might employ

44188,5437,3891,"I was obviously on a different wavelength than most of the reviewers here I guess, because I actually was fairly impressed with this film.  I wasn't expecting to like it, to be honest.  I was expecting another poor attempt at filmmaking that I could enjoy laughing at.  But much to my surprise, I found myself drawn in, and getting tense as events unfolded.  Maybe it's just I'm on the same wavelength as the filmmakers, in finding that situation pretty scary.  I thought they built up the tension very naturally and realistically, from the first encounter with the van on the highway, all through the subsequent and escalating seriousness of events.  I also thought the characters portrayed more or less the appropriate level of emotions at each stage.  I will admit I personally thought they ramped it up into full-blown panic a little sooner than I believed they should, but then I tempered my judgement by thinking these were just people totally unprepared in every way for a situation such as this.  They merely exhibited the behavior of people who let fear gain the upper hand, instead of getting a grip and making a concerted plan to deal with the situation.  (After all, they outnumbered the bad guy 4 to 1; they just didn't use it to their advantage.)

Anyway, I thought that overall this film was very well-paced and showed considerable talent on the filmmaker's part.  The acting was good, and the characters, if not exactly lovable, were not obnoxious and were generally easy to tolerate.  To me it had an overall feel of genuine reactions to circumstances, enough to draw me in much more than I ever expected.",1525132800,4,obvious differ wavelength review guess actual fairli impress film wasnt expect like honest expect anoth poor attempt filmmak could enjoy laugh much surpris found drawn get ten event unfold mayb im wavelength filmmak find situat pretti scari thought built tension natur realist first encount van highway subsequ escal serious event also thought charact portray le appropri level emot stage admit person thought ramp fullblown panic littl sooner believ temper judgement think peopl total unprepar everi way situat mere exhibit behavior peopl let fear gain upper hand instead get grip make concert plan deal situat outnumb bad guy 4 1 didnt use advantag anyway thought overal film wellpac show consider talent filmmak part act good charact exactli lovabl obnoxi gener easi toler overal feel genuin reaction circumst enough draw much ever expect

44306,3327,1905,"A freak lightning storm causes a war automaton to spontaneously go sentient during a military demonstration. If you were sentient yourself in '86, no doubt you remember this one. It's the epitome of an eighties movie in all the wrong ways: bad comedy, forced plot developments, a big dose of cold war overtones, a valley girl accent, Steve Guttenberg... the list is awfully lengthy. We've even got a white man in brown face, though he does nothing terribly egregious or offensive beyond the (surprisingly convincing) makeup.

Short Circuit manages to get by on the power of spirit and enthusiasm alone, which is itself another '80s stereotype. It's got energy to spare, plus absolutely no shame over its shortcomings, which makes it awkwardly endearing. Having said that, and appreciated it, the flick is often eye-roll bad, much worse than I'd remembered. Subtle like a bull on the warpath and cheesier than a Kraft dinner, I felt a little embarrassed for being such a fan back when I could still count my age on two hands.

44317,1386,3763,"""Unforgotten"" is a mystery miniseries first broadcast on Britain's ITV in six 45-minute episodes in 2015. It capitalizes on the popularity of cold case shows and on the recent fascination of the British public with their 20th century social history. The detectives are DCI Cassandra Stuart (Nicola Walker), a middle-aged divorce and empty-nester, and DI Sunil ""Sunny"" Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar), a family man presumably of Pakistani extraction. They are assisted by a team of investigating officers who do a lot of leg work. The skeleton of a young man is found buried in the basement of a building that is being demolished. The man was killed by a blunt force trauma from something like a hammer that put a hole in his skull. The building was built in 1886 but had been a boarding house called Arlingham House for young tenants at the time of the murder, which is determined to be between 1965 from the car ignition key found on the deceased and 1978, when the concrete floor was poured.

The mystery adheres strictly to a formula: The first episode is dedicated to identifying the victim and introducing us to characters who will later be suspects, witnesses, or the perpetrator. We see them in the present with only very brief, incoherent flashes back in time, their memories of the victim. The detectives make the rounds of potential witnesses in the usual fashion of television mysteries. In the usual fashion, the characters tell half-truths in order to conceal something that may or may not have anything to do with the crime in question, which causes the investigation to drag on for some time. The detectives make the rounds of the witnesses again and again, until they piece it together. The show has a technophilic streak in the spirit of CSI. It is only through cutting-edge technologies that the detectives get their initial clues as to the victim's identity.

Witnesses and suspects are: Sir Phillip Cross (Trevor Eve), a wealthy businessman recently nominated by Her Majesty's government to be its ""entrepreneur czar"". Sir Philip is very conscious of his lowly roots and has a great deal to hide about his start in the business world. Lizzie Wilton (Ruth Sheen), a working-class woman who lived at Arlingham House at the same time as the victim. She now works with underprivileged youth and acts as a den mother to the soccer team her husband coaches. But, in her youth, she was a homeless alcoholic who found refuge in the community of skinheads. Father Robert Graves (Bernard Hill) is a vicar whose efforts to appear to be the man his family thinks him to be have led him down a dark path. Eric Slater (Tom Courtenay) is a wheelchair-bound retired accountant who did the books for Arlingham House. He and wife Claire (Gemma Jones), who suffers from dementia, are celebrating their 45th wedding anniversary.

The supporting cast is impressive even if the two detectives are a bit dull. The multiple mysteries of what relationship these people had to the deceased keep the audience interested over the course of six episodes. I found DCI Stuart to be distasteful in her self-righteousness determination to punish the perpetrator of a 40-year-old crime. If I took anything away from this narrative, it is that the detectives should have let sleeping dogs lie. Dredging up the past wrecked everybody's life and there was no justice to be had. Beyond that, the characters too often do things that don't make sense and act in a manner that is not credible in order to make drama. There are some holes in the solution that we finally settle on. And why would someone be prosecuted for robbery 40 years after the event?  ""Unforgotten"" is entertaining enough but not a must-see, as it suffers many of the problems common to contemporary British mysteries, including a surfeit of social agendas.",1525132800,3,unforgotten mysteri miniseri first broadcast britain itv six 45minut episod 2015 capit popular cold case show recent fascin british public 20th centuri social histori detect dci cassandra stuart nicola walker middleag divorc emptynest di sunil sunni khan sanjeev bhaskar famili man presum pakistani extract assist team investig offic lot leg work skeleton young man found buri basement build demolish man kill blunt forc trauma someth like hammer put hole skull build built 1886 board hous call arlingham hous young tenant time murder determin 1965 car ignit key found deceas 1978 concret floor pour mysteri adher strictli formula first episod dedic identifi victim introduc u charact later suspect wit perpetr see present brief incoher flash back time memori victim detect make round potenti wit usual fashion televis mysteri usual fashion charact tell halftruth order conceal someth may may anyth crime question caus investig drag time detect make round wit piec togeth show technophil streak spirit csi

Exploring a haunted asylum sounds like a great premise for a horror movie.  But the acting from Jennifer and Dr Laurel was so atrocious, and Dr Laurel was such a jerk.  I hated listening to the oral history of the asylum.  I wanted to bail.  There were several times I wanted to bail.  The first time was when the discussion of God got brought up.  I thought for certain the film would take a religious slant.  The last time was when Dr Laurel and Jennifer did a controlled possession and the demon's echoed voice over Jennifer's was annoying.  But I stuck with the movie.  All hour and 41 minutes.  The ending was actually good.  If the film had only been the very beginning and the very end, it would've been a 5 star film.

44335,2262,5459,"This is one of those films from the psychedelic 1960s that stands alone, with no other film against which to compare it (except maybe ""What's New, Pussycat?"").  Good?  Bad?  No to both.  This film is unique.

The original intent was to produce a serious screen adaptation of Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel; however, talks broke down between ""Casino Royale"" producer Charles Feldman and producer Albert Broccoli (who had already produced 4 incredibly successful James Bond movies starring Sean Connery). Broccoli didn't want Feldman's vision for ""Casino Royale"" even associated with the already-lucrative film series.

So, almost in defiance of Broccoli, Feldman produced ""Casino Royale"" as a spoof, an off-the-wall mockery of James Bond movies, instead.  Thus, 1967's ""Casino Royale"" was born.

There's no real way to describe this film except to say ""madcap"" and ""slapstick""...the twisting, winding plot and the parade of celebrities throughout the film make any succinct description pretty much impossible.  There are gigantic plotholes and continuity errors, making it appear that the various scenes were shot by several different directors.  In fact, that is the case...6 different directors worked this film.

While comic Peter Sellers gives a rather low-key performance, the funniest scenes definitely go to comedy veteran David Niven, who is both debonaire and absurd.  Longtime dramatic actress Deborah Kerr also lets down her hair and plays balls-out comedy like it was her first love.  These scenes are nothing less than a delight.

Again, Peter Sellers earns his pay in different roles, but he's not slam-dunking the comedy (there are no ""Inspector Clouseau"" moments for Sellers in this film, unfortunately).

The lineup of famous (and not-yet-famous) actors in ""Casino Royale"" is formidable and too lengthy for a brief review, except to note Ursula Andress, Orson Welles, William Holden, Charles Boyer, John Huston, Anjelica Huston, Peter O'Toole, George Raft, Woody Allen, David Prowse (yes, Darth Vader) and many others.

Warning you in advance, you WILL get lost in this movie because the story is disorganized and, let's just say it, crazy as hell.

But there's a reason why this film was nominated for an Academy Award, and that reason was the soundtrack, which introduced the wildly popular song ""The Look of Love"" by Burt Bacharach and Hal David.  Although it failed to win the 1968 Oscar for Best Song, it was covered by dozens of established recording artists for many years thereafter (and was even inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008).

Between ""The Look of Love"" and Herb Alpert's brassy ""Casino Royale"" theme music, the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission.",1525219200,5,one film psychedel 1960 stand alon film compar except mayb what new pussycat good bad film uniqu origin intent produc seriou screen adapt ian fleme first jame bond novel howev talk broke casino royal produc charl feldman produc albert broccoli alreadi produc 4 incred success jame bond movi star sean conneri broccoli didnt want feldman vision casino royal even associ alreadylucr film seri almost defianc broccoli feldman produc casino royal spoof offthewal mockeri jame bond movi instead thu 1967 casino royal born there real way describ film except say madcap slapstickth twist wind plot parad celebr throughout film make succinct descript pretti much imposs gigant plothol continu error make appear variou scene shot sever differ director fact case6 differ director work film comic peter seller give rather lowkey perform funniest scene definit go comedi veteran david niven debonair absurd longtim dramat actress deborah kerr also let hair play ballsout comedi like first love scene noth le delight peter seller earn pay differ role he slamdunk comedi inspector clouseau moment seller film unfortun lineup famou notyetfam actor casino royal formid lengthi brief review except note ursula andress orson well william holden charl boyer john huston anjelica huston peter

44338,694,5499,"Marilyn Monroe is considered an iconic representation of the Hollywood female star. Her looks still inspire millions who adore her. Her breathless dialogue is mimicked to the point it is recognizable. The term glamour is still associated with her. But few look back further than those major performances she left for us to view. Not so with the release of DONT BOTHER TO KNOCK.

This is Monroes first major role, the first film where she had a lead worth noting. She certainly had starring roles in previous films but this was the first to place her center stage in the lead role. Film historians consider her performance here one to back up the claim that she was a talent that deserved more than she received.

Monroe stars as Nell Forbes, a young woman whose uncle Eddie (Elisha Cook Jr.) works as an elevator operator in a posh New York City hotel. Peter and Ruth Jones (Jim Backus and Lurene Tuttle) are in town for him to receive an award at a dinner in the hotel that night and have brought along their young daughter Bunny (Donna Corcoran). Eddie has assured them that Nell is the perfect woman for the job and soon they're introduced and the pair go off to their dinner.

While this is transpiring we also meet Jed Towers (Richard Widmark) and Lyn Lesley (Anne Bancroft). Lyn is a singer in the lounge at the same hotel and has just broken off her relationship with Jed, a man who comes to town periodically but offers her no hope of a future together. Feeling that Jed has no sense of emotion deep inside Lyn tells him her issues and he leaves, going up to his room.

That room is right across the way from the room Nell is in. Looking across the way Jed sees her. Nell has now displayed a different side of herself to us the viewers. She begins by eating chocolates the Jones have left behind. She puts on a nightgown of Ruths as well as stocking and her jewelry. Jed assumes shes in her room and calls her to flirt, eventually getting himself an invite to come over.

This rebound date for Jed turns out to be more than he expected. While things seem to move along smoothly at first he soon learns the truth about Nell. At the same time we begin to learn more about her as well, including the fact that she lost the love of her life and has attempted suicide. The question rises what will she do here in this situation? Is Bunny safe in her care? Will she do harm to Jed?

The movie move along at a steady pace and holds your interest from start to finish. I wasn't sure in reading the synopsis that this would be the case or not. Fortunately it does so and does it well. Even better than that were presented with two main characters that we have no reason to sympathize with, two characters that at first seem to earn our disdain only to learn, as they do, that there is more going on beneath their shells than we expected.

Ive never been a fan of Monroe and honestly this film didn't make me one. Ive always found her breathless way of speaking to be annoying and it can be that way at times here in this film. But she does hold her own and shows a certain amount of allure that would go on to make her a huge success. Widmark by this time had already made his mark as a star. He could have hogged the camera for himself but his performance here shows he was willing to provide an assist to someone new, both in Monroe and Bancrofts performances. Bancrofts role here isn't at the heart of things but she does provide a character that helps to bring out the best in Widmarks.

Twilight Time is releasing the film as they do with all of their titles, in a great looking hi def 1080p presentation and limiting the release to just 3,000 copies. This time around theyve included several great extras to be enjoyed including an isolated music track, a featurette called MARILYN MONROE: THE MORTAL GODDESS, another featurette RICHARD WIDMARK: STRENGTH OF CHARACTERS and the original theatrical trailer. If you're a Monroe or Widmark fan make sure you order this today.

I believe this was Suzanne Pleshette's second film and the two of them were convincing lovers. They did marry (but for a short time), too bad their marriage did not last. For me, the ultimate of romantic scenes in film history was their stopover in a dimly lit cafe, the Italian singer Emilio Percoli singing what became a monster hit, ""Al Di La"".

44376,19,3735,"An excellent and biting political satire, this film is not so much about smoking as the PR-lobbyist industry - what they used to call, in more honest times, propaganda.  The US may not have a Dr. Goebbels and an official Ministry of Propaganda, but the technique of the Big Lie is alive and well in Washington.  (Although the modern PR industry was born in WW I America, when President Wilson commissioned Edward Bernays, nephew of Sigmund Freud, to sell American war involvement through the ""Committee on Public Information.""  Bernays was in fact connected to Big Tobacco also, promoting female smoking as ""Torches of Freedom."")

In short, selling lies is the first step to profit and power.  Americans at least don't have the excuse as did other victims of propaganda: ""we didn't know,"" and even if we did, there's police and prisons for saying differently.  Here it's even more insidious - the willful suspension of fact and common sense based on individual choice of what feels good and convenient.  Ironic but fitting that a country producing such a magnificent satire should be ruled by its current 45th president.

In the final cut, though, we have a film in which no one's really good or bad, and everyone wins in the end (except J. K. Simmons).  The deleted scene of Aaron Eckhart slapping the cigarette out of son Cameron Bright's mouth on the steps of Congress should have been retained to drive the last coffin nail, as cigarettes were once called.",1525219200,4,excel bite polit satir film much smoke prlobbyist industri use call honest time propaganda u may dr goebbel offici ministri propaganda techniqu big lie aliv well washington although modern pr industri born ww america presid wilson commiss edward bernay nephew sigmund freud sell american war involv committe public inform bernay fact connect big tobacco also promot femal smoke torch freedom short sell lie first step profit power american least dont excus victim propaganda didnt know even there polic prison say differ even insidi will suspens fact common sen base individu choic feel good conveni iron fit countri produc magnific satir rule current 45th presid final cut though film one realli good bad everyon win end except j k simmon delet scene aaron eckhart slap cigarett son cameron bright mouth step congress retain drive last coffin nail cigarett call

44417,694,2169,"Twilight Time offers another Woody Allen film for fans to enjoy or non-fans to disregard. Once more he teams of with life partner (at the time) Mia Farrow to present a tale that takes place in his familiar New York City. This time he takes the neurosis found in most of his films and gives them nods to both the Lewis Carroll classic ALICE IN WONDERLAND and Federico Fellinis JULIET OF THE SPIRITS.

Alice (Farrow) is a well to do married woman who still feel empty inside. Her days are spent with the children being looked over by their nanny, shopping at the most expensive stores and with nothing more than small talk with her wealthy husband Doug (William Hurt). Picking up the kids one day she sees another parent there named Joe (Joe Mantegna) that shes attracted to.

Her guilt over this attraction causes her to have back pains. Complaining of the backache to her friends while shopping one suggest that she try an acupuncturist and herbalist she know called Dr. Yang (Keye Luke in his final film performance). With nothing to lose Alice visits Yang who tells her the problem is not in her back but in her head and her heart. He provides her with some herbs to take at a precise time.

The next day she picks up the kids after taking the herbs and meets Joe again while waiting. The herbs have left her uninhibited and she flirts mercilessly with Joe, making a date to meet the following day. She doesnt follow through with the date but returns to Dr. Yang who gives her new herbs to use, this time making her invisible.

While invisible she watches Joe as he meets up with his ex-wife (Judy Davis) in her office and the two have a quickie there for old times sake. This makes her glad she didn't go through with her meeting. It also sends her back to Dr. Yang who gives her different herbs, this time giving her the ability to see her old beau, Ed (Alec Baldwin), who died before they could marry. Ed suggest that she give Joe a chance and learn more about him.

Each suggestion that Alice follows opens up new doors to whats really going on inside of her, her true emotions and feelings, rather than the superficial life shes been leaving. And each time she learns something new she returns to Dr. Yang who gives her more herbs that lead her in more directions with more people. Whether or not she will learn from her experiences and find happiness is what rounds out the film by the end credits.

The story is interesting and inventive in its mix of mysticism, romance and light comedy. Each new herb yields yet another small story within the context of the larger whole, revealing as much about Alice to us as she learns about herself. The writing is some of the better that Allen has done from the films of his Ive seen and it works well within the confines of the NYC world of the elite.

The cinematography here is amazing. Where some movies do well either with interiors or exteriors but not always both, cinematographer Carlo di Palma (famous for shooting BLOW UP as well as many of Allens later films) shows an expertise to be envied. His use of lighting and camera angles works in every shot.

Perhaps the weakest element the film has is its lead actress, Farrow. Ill admit that my exposure to her performances is pretty limited to her appearances in other Allen films and ROSEMARYS BABY. Ive never found her to be a dynamic actress whose work I would want to seek out. But her performances in the films shot in NYC for Allen always feel the same to me. She always seems as if shes a weak willed woman with a constantly whining voice, always unsure of herself and more inclined to wallow in self-pity than anything else. Having recently watch Allens MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY and learning that she had been intended to play the role Diane Keaton did I kept thinking that that movie would have felt completely different if that had happened. And not for the better. It doesnt matter if Alice finds herself here or not, the majority of the film has her so self-deprecating that it made it hard for me to feel for her.

While critically acclaimed and nominated for various screenplay awards the movie was a box office flop. It should have done better because for the minor flaws in the film it was entertaining and a good representation of Allens films. Perhaps it will find an audience on discs that will make up for that box office loss.

Twilight Time is offering the film in a beautiful blu-ray presentation here in 1080p. Extras are slim to non-existent with just an isolated music & effects track and the original theatrical trailer. But fans of Allen will want to grab this up since like other Twilight Time releases it is limited to just 3,000 copies.",1525219200,3,twilight time offer anoth woodi allen film fan enjoy nonfan disregard team life partner time mia farrow present tale take place familiar new york citi time take neurosi found film give nod lewi carrol classic alic wonderland federico fellini juliet spirit alic farrow well marri woman still feel empti insid day spent child look nanni shop expens store noth small talk wealthi husband doug william hurt pick kid one day see anoth parent name joe joe mantegna she attract guilt attract caus back pain complain backach friend shop one suggest tri acupuncturist herbalist know call dr yang key luke final film perform noth lose alic visit yang tell problem back head heart provid herb take precis time next day pick kid take herb meet joe wait herb left uninhibit flirt mercilessli joe make date meet follow day doesnt follow date return dr yang give new herb use time make invis invis watch joe meet exwif judi davi offic two

44455,505,2887,"S2 avoids a lot of interesting logistical issues and case details by simply cutting to a new scene, but dwells on mundane familial issues as if pathetically trying to defend Dexters humanity. Of course Dexter is human, and a lot of viewers probably felt bad for Dexter without this cloying mess. Then again, hes pretty boring for a serial killer who insinuates himself into every crime scene even though hes usually not working (I think they pay him 100k to do 8 hours per week), so maybe the writers should have tried to prove his complexity instead of his humanity.

I have some other issues (slow pacing, the dialogue is trite, the nudity is boring, all 4 female characters seem to invite loathing, Dexter doesnt wear gloves when handling the plastic sheeting nor the garbage bags... he's getting fingerprints everywhere, problems seem to magically resolve themselves offscreen I could go on) but my main beef with s2 is SPOILERS AHEAD Spoilers: Doakes convenient and horrifying death. It felt like he was the only person keeping Dexter in check; without Doakes, Dexter actually becomes a threat to viewers neutrality. I wasn't fond of Doakes, but he made some tremendous sacrifices and took decisive, heroic action (even if illegally obtained evidence is inadmissible in court?). In a vacuum, I don't mind when the universe squishes the hero things happen. But in s2 finale, too many coincidences felt deus ex machina. Lame. It pissed me off when Dexter--who had previously been a paragon of logic--suggested that between the only cop in the department with shrewd instincts and himself, the blood guy (who seems to specialize in other forensic investigation as necessary), that their relative values to the community would be ""a wash."" Really? Dexter may be a specialist, but Doakes seemed more irreplaceable, unless you weigh Dexter's questionably noble extracurriculars. But none of this matters, because karma haunts every character except Dexter. Viewers knew from the jump that Doakes was fated to die horribly because heaven forbid Dexter get caught.... such a plot twist would generate extra work for the writers. Sigh. Even Hannibal did time, and he was more intelligent than Dexter, who sees Doakes' horribly mangled remains and brilliantly assumes that the universe has intervened on his behalf.

Not sure if I will watch s3. This seems on trajectory to become Desperate Housewives of Sociopaths, minus the intrigue.

Only I was wrong.  It is somewhat of a mix of those crime shows with a soap opera tied in, but I really didn't mind.  Season 5 was a great season but probably not as good as the first few.

44598,2687,1848,"Once more, police surgeon Doctor Lucien Blake finds himself uncovering murderers. He has a good supporting cast helping or hindering him, as the case may be. I particularly like Alice Harvey, the Russian-born pathologist with whom he works closely. At one autopsy, she asks him, ""Are you all right? You don't seem yourself. You've barely said a word, to me or him."" She's referring  to Blake's habit of talking respectfully to the murder victims.

The series sometimes strays into the unrealistic, such as Lucien breaking & entering to find clues. But it has always been like that and it is a small irritant, not enough to affect my enjoyment of the mysteries.

Speaking of enjoyment, at the end of episode 3 there is a huge surprise for the audience. But not as big of a surprise as it is for Lucien, who opens his door and stands there in shock with his mouth open.

....1...""The Open Road"" Ballaret is hosting a stage of the 1960 Red Australia Trial, a motor rally whose winners may go on to further glory in the Nationals. Dirty tricks abound, such as leaving a fire cracker to stir up the dust and obscure the view on a sharp curve. But can a dirty trick include murder?
....2...""Golden Years"" The Foster brothers announce a new development, Goldrush Park. Not everyone is happy about it. Someone is murderously unhappy.
....3...""Lucky Numbers"" Ten year-old Elizabeth Chapman gives her Mummy a kiss and heads off to school. She less than a block away when she realizes she forgot her lunch on the kitchen table. She rushes back to the kitchen to find broken plates and a bloody knife of the kitchen floor. And her mother no where to be seen.
....4...""Against the Odds"" It's in the early morning hours, and Alexander Martin is exercising a horse at the track. He comes galloping down the straight when he is flung of his horse to his death. As his aunt tells Blake, ""What experienced rider falls on a training run?""
....5...""The Place of Love"" At midnight a man runs through the woods of the Hayes Military Base outside of Ballaret. It's Lance Corporal Mervyn Rogers, but he's in civvies and running right through the middle of tactical night maneuvers. But they use only blanks on maneuvers. Don't they?
....6...""A Difficult Lie"" Local mogul Patrick Tyneman is playing golf with the new Chief Superintendent when they find a bloodied body in a bunker. Definitely a bad lie.
Keep your eyes peeled for the kangaroos on the golf course!
....7...""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" Ballaret has a volunteer fire service. The firehouse has a bell tower and it is rung to call the volunteers when needed. One night, the bell rings, and Rod Drury rushes over to find no one else there. Well, no one but a murderer.
....8...""The Visible World"" Special glasses all around to view a solar eclipse. The Ballaret Observatory opens its doors and there's a murder. I must say, the rationale given for the bad guy's urge to murder doesn't seem realistic to me. Unless, he wasn't the murderer.

Season 4 of ""Doctor Blake"" totals 472 minutes for the 8 episodes. If you buy it on disc, it has English SDH subtitles available and no bonus features.

At the beginning of this season, we say goodbye to Mattie, the cheerful district nurse who boards at Blake's. She's taken a job in London, and who would want to hold her back. Now it's just Lucien and Jean in the house.

44645,4972,841,"""Super 8"" is the type of a movie camera. This movie was a big hit when it was released in 2011. It is the 1970's era about a group of boys and their leader, a large over weight boy who believes he can tell everyone what to do; he is in charge a making a film (using a super 8 movie camera) to admit for a school prize about a vampire! They are in the local train station doing some of their scenes when they see one of their teacher's driving his pickup truck on the railroad tracks towards a train that is coming in the man's direction!

44660,2525,4963,"Having just seen Rust and Bone, in which Marion Cotillard starred and stunned, I looked for more of her work, and found this biopic, which garnered her top awards. Its the story of a precious child, discarded by her mother, mothered by 2 caring prostitutes in a brothel, then seized by her father, who forced her to sing for sustenance in the streets of Paris. That rare and powerful voice would become dith Piafs ticket to stardom, but all the early insults to her soul would produce a painfully fractured adult.  Piafs songs are prominent throughout, Cotillards lip syncing exceptional.  One scene in which she is singing before a large audience, but we are hearing no sound, highlights her amazing acting skills, in this sort of mimed presentation. I found Cotillards performance greater than the sum of the films parts, although all filmmaking elements are exceptionally rendered, and the acting, in toto, is solid.  For me, the story lacks cohesion, and its not just a result of the flashbacks.  While it is critical to recount the nodal events that formed the person, character development is a bit thin.  The abundance of flashbacks sometimes interrupts what ought to be a more natural progression and fleshing-out of the Piaf character, skimping on the what-happens-next element, in favor of what happened before.  But if you want to hear the great music of dith Piaf, see Cotillards brilliant performance, and marvel at how she fully transforms herself in every film, do not miss this one.",1525305600,4,seen rust bone marion cotillard star stun look work found biopic garner top award stori preciou child discard mother mother 2 care prostitut brothel seiz father forc sing susten street pari rare power voic would becom dith piaf ticket stardom earli insult soul would produc pain fractur adult piaf song promin throughout cotillard lip sync except one scene sing larg audienc hear sound highlight amaz act skill sort mime present found cotillard perform greater sum film part although filmmak element except render act toto solid stori lack cohes result flashback critic recount nodal event form person charact develop bit thin abund flashback sometim interrupt ought natur progress fleshingout piaf charact skimp whathappensnext element favor happen want hear great music dith piaf see cotillard brilliant perform marvel fulli transform everi film miss one

44687,2202,917,"LOST won an Emmy (2005) for Outstanding Drama Series, and a Golden Globe (2006) for Best TV series (Drama). During it's run the series was nominated for approximately 254 awards, winning 56. The series still places prominently on lists of Best TV Shows of all Time (having held the number one spot on such lists on many occasions).

From Breaking Bad to The Arrow to The 100, one can easily see the influence of LOST on many other television projects. It raised the bar for character development, production values, and intricate plot structures.

When looking back on all of the TV shows I've watched, no other series has ever reached so deeply into my thoughts and emotions. I've never experienced anything else quite like it. It's an amazingly intricate bit of storytelling that supercharges the imagination.

I recently watched the entire series for the fourth time. I was quite surprised how much I still enjoyed the experience even knowing about all of the mysteries. A decade and half after its debut, LOST is proving to be a timeless work.

The first three seasons of LOST are an amazing achievement, but unfortunately it all begins to unravel in season four. What starts as an incredibly imaginative psychological drama/mystery devolves into comic book styled schlock.

The ending of season THREE is mind blowing and will leave your imagination running wild. If you stop watching at that point you'll probably conjure up thousands of amazing possibilities that are more intriguing and satisfying than what the writers eventually settled on. If you continue to watch, many elements of season FOUR (especially the ending) establish LOST as nothing more than a grand, somewhat schlocky sci-fi series. It could have been so much more.

Even considering the problems with the final three seasons, LOST remains my favorite TV series of all time. If you've never seen it, I highly recommend it.

4 stars for this season, but 5 for the entire series.",1525305600,5,lost emmi 2005 outstand drama seri golden globe 2006 best tv seri drama run seri nomin approxim 254 award win 56 seri still place promin list best tv show time held number one spot list mani occas break bad arrow 100 one easili see influenc lost mani televis project rais bar charact develop product valu intric plot structur look back tv show ive watch seri ever reach deepli thought emot ive never experienc anyth el quit like amazingli intric bit storytel supercharg imagin recent watch entir seri fourth time quit surpris much still enjoy experi even know mysteri decad half debut lost prove timeless work first three season lost amaz achiev unfortun begin unravel season four start incred imagin psycholog dramamysteri devolv comic book style schlock end season three mind blow leav imagin run wild stop watch point youll probabl conjur thousand amaz possibl intrigu satisfi writer eventu settl continu watch mani element season four especi end establish lost noth grand somewhat schlocki scifi seri could much even consid problem final three season lost remain

44729,2262,295,"Hooboy. Here we go with another ""Everybody is weird except me"" horror flick.

Billy's parents are acting weird. His sister, friends and girlfriend are acting weird. His therapist, the cops, the paramedics and the judge are acting weird.

In fact, almost EVERYBODY is acting weird except Billy. He even starts doubting his own sanity...until, that is, one of his only ""normal"" friends provides hard evidence that something mighty weird and cultish is indeed afoot.

Yes, it's a clichd storyline that has been done to death for decades (see ""The Faculty"" for another example). What's worse is that this film prolongs the mystery about twice as long as necessary before the big reveal.

So, thirty minutes into the movie, you start muttering, ""Yes, I get it. Something strange is going on. Can we please move it along?"" An hour into the movie, you're yelling, ""I GET IT, I GET IT! SOMETHING STRANGE IS GOING ON!! FFS, GET TO THE REVEAL, ALREADY!!""

When it finally arives, a solid hour and twenty minutes into the film, the reveal isn't that great. Practically the whole community is comprised of morphing mutants who engage in oil-soaked orgies as they assimilate human flesh. Yawn.

What's really bad is that the makeup and monster effects aren't anywhere NEAR the quality that you expect from Screaming Mad George (whose name alone is the main attraction for most weird monster lovers). I don't know why this movie won awards and praise for makeup effects, because all we get in this film are fifteen minutes of stretchy latex and baby oil.

That's it, THAT'S the big reveal. Then, boom, roll credits.

Are fifteen minutes of half-hearted practical effects worth an hour and twenty minutes of a boring, formulaic build-up?

44786,265,1626,"Dario Argentos classic witch movie is hardly a witch movie at all but, wow, the man could cultivate great atmosphere!

Newcomer ballerina Suzy (Jessica Harper; Suspiria 2018 remake) attends a strict German ballet academy to find that not all is as it seems. Something sinister is afoot, and her roommate (Stefania Casini; Blood for Dracula) is eager to help her solve the mystery.

Writer (in part) and director Dario Argento (Mother of Tears, Phenomena) relies tremendously on atmosphere, heavily utilizing greens, blues and reds in the set design, wardrobe and lighting to augment the mood. The sets are gorgeous, the dancers are catty (and also gorgeous) and the characters represent exaggerated stereotypes although perhaps not so exaggerated for the 70s. The acting may feel a bit rigid, at times, while delivering an often over-explanatory script. But not in a way that affected my enjoyment of the film.

With my contemporary eyes, Im not impressed with the clunky execution of the death scenes. Retractable knives just don't do it for me and, while quaint, the visual of a victim being stabbed directly in the heart through a hole in her sternum didn't really nail it either. But Argento had a flare for drama, and the post-mortem shots were appropriately macabre.

I was particularly fond of the opening death when the bystander was impaled by large pieces of glass and window framing from the ceiling. However, quite to the contrary, the bewitched murderous dog scene was just okay and I was completely unmoved by the maggot infestation scene. But, again, Im watching with 2018 eyes, having seen perhaps 1000 horror movies released after 1977. So, theres that. And when have maggots ever really been done well except for The Lost Boys (1985)?

We find ourselves asking a lot of questions like where did all the maggots come from? Where do the instructors go at night? Why is Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett; Dark Shadows) so pushy about where the dancers sleep? Why did it take so long for the killer to jimmie open that lock and why the Hell was that floor filled feet deep with wire coils? Yeah, some questions are weirder than others.

Everything builds to a rather anticlimactic, generally unsatisfying and completely unresolved (yet still over-explained) ending featuring no stronger special effects or urgency than earlier in the film. Truly, the films greatest assets were the least dramatic: Udo Kier (Blade, Flesh for Frankenstein) making his least melodramatic appearance ever, and Barbara Magnolfi (The Sister of Ursula) as the deliciously catty ballerina. Lets face it, this sorcerous school is no Hogwarts.

Dare I say it, but this beloved classic felt boring. Yeah, I said it. But honestly, most classic horror bores melike the original Halloween (1978). My enjoyment in these films (and, yes, I do enjoy them despite my criticism) is seeing how tropes were utilized back then, before themes were yet overused; their early iterations that inspired the films to come and the concepts that would be copied, honored, or simply ripped off by their successors. So, for me, watching Suspiria feels like taking a snazzy horror film appreciation class. And, even if boring, I appreciated it for that.

44820,266,3573,"A remarkable fossil is discovered (and almost destroyed) in the Amazon, prompting an expedition to find the rest of the creature that is supposed to link land and marine animals. Dr. Carl Maia assembles a team to do this, including ichtyologist Dr. David Reed, Dr. Mark Williams the investor, and Kay Lawrence. When they arrive, Dr. Maia's assistants are killed by a living version of the fossil, who fixates on Kay while trying to kill all the other members of the party. Can the expedition trap the creature alive and escape with their lives?

The Creature from the Black Lagoon was never one of my favorite Universal monster movies, but I hadn't watched it since I was a child. However, looking at now, it's an enjoyable and complex film. First, there's the contrast between the main men in the film. David Reed and Mark Williams couldn't be more different. Reed focuses on scientific findings and breakthroughs while Williams is in it for money, fortune, and fame. In the modern ""remake"" The Shape of Water, he has a lot in common with Strickland while Reed has more in common with Hoffstetler, the Russian undercover agent that does what he can to make sure the unique creature lives. Unfortunately, much of this film is Reed and Williams posturing, arguing, competing, and swimming around, which gets old pretty quick.

Kay Lawrence is a much more interesting character than I remember. All of the iconic pictures of her are with the Gill-man carrying her and essentially being a damsel in distress for her boyfriend to save. While this is true of the last half of the film, the first half has her challenging men in authority and making some surprisingly modern life decisions. Kay works with Dr. Reed and although she isn't a doctor, she is educated and goes on the expedition as another scientist. When Maia says Reed doesn't look like an ichthyologist as an attractive, fit young man, Kay counters with a sassy remark. She and Reed have chosen not to marry, a controversial decision for the time, and seem to be financially independent of each other, although Reed currently makes more money. Kay doesn't sit quietly and let the men talk like other heroines of the time.  Reed supports her completely and never admonishes her. Their relationship looks healthy by todays standards and that's saying something since the same isn't true for many films today.

The Creature itself is fairly sympathetic, as most monsters are in the Universal canon. He is the last living member of a race of amphibious humans. The expedition is invading his home and he's defending it as he always has, giving rise to myths and rumors of a cursed lagoon. When he sees Kay, he develops feelings for her, swimming beneath her while she swims along the surface of the lagoon. This scene is beautiful and shows the humanity of the creature. I can see why Del Toro wanted to make a film where they end up together. Of course the Gill-man kills quite a few of the expeditions' lackeys, usually defending himself. The Gill-man design is as recognizable as Dracula or Frankenstien, which was created by Millicent Patrick and a team of designers. Unfortunately, George Westmore wasn't happy with sharing the limelight with anyone else when Patrick went on a press tour as The Beauty who Created the Beast, denying that she had anything to do with the creature design. He refused to work with her again despite her giving him credit during the tour, ending her career at Universal. She had worked there for years contributing to designs and it's such a shame that her career was ending by a jealous man.

The Creature from the Black Lagoon is an undeniably cheesy movie that has the marks of a Universal monster movie. The creature is sympathetic and the leading woman breaks social norms. The cheesy aspects had the theater laughing, especially when the Gill-man theme played so many times, an unfortunate studio decision, or when shots were obviously recycled several times.

44950,6729,928,"This 2 disc 4K Ultra HD/Digital HD Blu-Ray set of James Cameron's 1991 Science Fiction movie classic, Terminator 2 Judgement Day, arrived on time and undamaged. Picture, sound and features are exceptional now that this movie has been fully restored and updated for 4K viewing pleasure, but the downsize to this new release of the James Cameron masterpiece is that it advertises on the case cover and outer slipcover as showing this movie in three alternative viewing formats ( Theatrical, Directors Cut and Extended Version), which takes the running time up to 154 minutes on both the Blu-Ray Digital HD disc and the 4K Ultra HD/HDR disc, but this is not the case. This new re-release in the two upgraded formats shows the same fim on the two discs to playing it in the Theatrical Version only. Lastly the soundtrack is not in Dolby Atmos 7.1 and above as it should be. The film is still a joy to watch now that it is now in 4K. its a shame that James Cameron wasn't personally involved in both the remastering of the film to 4K and getting all three versions of the film on to both Blu-Ray/4K movie discs.

If it had told me they were a randomly chosen group of strangers, I would have believed that too.  ""Mom"" is detached, appearing only to want to maintain the proper distance between herself and the riff-raff she is compelled to associate with.  ""Dad"" is a goofy, but touchy acquaintance staying for awhile and trying to fit in, but everyone is wishing he would just leave.  ""Daughter"" is the hired caregiver who takes her job seriously and wants to do well so she'll get good references.  ""Son"" is bland and generic with toddler-level drawing skills.

House is haunted.  I know this because movie showed me some fleeting figures, lights flickering, a toy starting by itself, doors closing & locking people in, etc. (just continue with every haunted house indicator you've seen at least a dozen times each).

House has tragic history.  That's easy, because there's a couple of old guys in the movie.  Plus, ""Daughter""  goes to library and looks at old book.  We see old newspaper clippings.  Creepy old picture of creepy old folk is found by ""Dad"" & he cottons to it right away.  Scenes of old-timey kids running around.  Etc. again.

45007,6583,1898,"Though it is a very good film -- actually two films in one -- it does not equal the perfection of The Godfather (now known as Part I).  The best half is that of the young Vito.  The less than superb half is the continuing story of Michael.  Everyone knows these films, so I'll just say that the Michael half is humorless and some scenes do not ring quite right.  Would Kay and Michael really throw that overblown day long party with every Corleone acquaintance, including the senator from Nevada, to celebrate their son's first communion?  How could would-be assassins get outside Kay and Michael's bedroom window on that fortress-like compound?  I don't believe that Kay Corleone would have a healthy baby son aborted to stop ""This Sicilian Thing.""  Would Fredo really have instigated a hit on his brother that could well have killed Kay also?  I realize these are fictional characters, but their personalities are clearly drawn and understood by the end of G Part I.  So Coppola I think stretched credulity a bit in G Part II.
I also think Michael's dealings with Hyman Roth are a little difficult to understand as presented.  This was potentially a very fascinating relationship that could have been developed more fully. (""Michael, we're bigger than US Steel."")  I could go on with even little things (for instance the way Mama Corleone is dressed while in her casket), but I'll just assume that the director didn't consider these particularly important.
Still, as a sequel (and a prequel) to G Part I, this is a very fine film.  It is not a masterpiece as G Part I is, but it is exponentially better than the ill-conceived G Part III.

I assume those details exist in the DC Comics graphic novels this film is based upon, but the film's plot is confusing without knowing those details. That said, I found this film (and its characters) weak: John Constantine and his earthly friends struggle exhaustingly against the encroaching demons of a smugly superior devil, while the angel Gabriel prioritizes belittling John Constantine's moral weakness over saving humanity's earthly realm. The film effectively uses CGI to depict demons on earth and to depict hell's devastation, but hell's torments are not depicted.",1525392000,3,first view found film puzzl knew miss plot background detail second view produc addit plot detail assum detail exist dc comic graphic novel film base upon film plot confus without know detail said found film charact weak john constantin earthli friend struggl exhaustingli encroach demon smugli superior devil angel gabriel priorit belittl john constantin moral weak save human earthli realm film effect use cgi depict demon earth depict hell devast hell torment depict

No, I don't feel sorry for them; they didn't feel sorry for their victims. But I cant imagine living with the knowledge of having done something so horrible. They look so cocky as kids, and I remember the pictures of them on the news. They WERE cocky. But we age, and we can see how we might have had some silly ideas when we were kids. We moved past them.

Here's the deal: This is a far cry from ""Apocalypse Now"" or ""Full Metal Jacket.""  In fact, it's a far cry from any film that involves discernment or critical thought. It's more like a video game transposed onto the silver screen.

But we all need to be entertained sometimes, and this accomplishes that.  It's fine.  But the back stories are rote and totally unconvincing.  And the conflict that inevitably develops between the CIA staff and the military contractors is entirely color by numbers.

45081,240,471,"I personally enjoyed this movie a lot. Justin might not be Oscar material, but he's very charismatic on the screen and plays a likeable characters with very funny one liners. He definitely doesn't shy away from making fun of stereotypical bad rom-com movies and it shows. I also love watching Mila Kunis films, so when you add both of them together in a setting where they decide to do random hookups but trying to remain as best friends, I had high expectations for this film.

The first portion of the movie is great. Both of them live on the meat market fast lane of downtown Manhattan and are constantly being dumped by romantic partners over petty issues. Fed up of the annoyance of dating and with a tad too many beers, they decide to start to sleep with each other whenever they are in the mood, no strings attached. Truth to say, the movie begins on a hilarious note.

The issue begins when it has to take the formulaic serious section of the film where Mila starts to harbor feelings for her friend but he doesn't. The script just isn't strong enough for a serious drama fest and instead of being compelling, the movie becomes very slow and tedious and never fully recovers. I also had a huge issue when we discover Justin's father in the film suffers from Alzheimers and Mila feels shocked. It seems really out of place that he'd leave a life-long friend out of the blue of this type of devastating news. Especially since he seems to be rather emotionally close to his parents even though they live in the other side of the country.

If you ignore the faults of the movie, it's still rather fun. However, I still feel sad that they opted for the abuse of drama halfway into the movie.

45150,3195,5366,"I rarely give such a whole-hearted, unreserved, 5 star rating!

I watched this several years ago,  before the last season was available.

I was home from work recovering from surgery and 2 of the guys I worked with were hooked on it. One loved it so much he bought the CD'S and gave them to me to watch while I was convalescing..

I was a little reluctant because it's based on a family that lives in the upper floors of a large Victorian mansion in Northern California, and operate their funeral home business on the lower floors.

Funerals, and funeral homes kind of scare me, and I wasn't
sure I would last. But the brief references to the actual work and scenes in the embalming room usually have another purpose, and it was fine.

But I have to say, the rather Gothic, sometimes fairy tale nature, and the fact I had the CD's to binge watch, did make me feel like I was immersed in ""6 Feet Under"" world, and it wasn't a show I could casually watch once a week.

Even though this was on HBO several years ago, it is so well written, it more than stands the test of time. NO question, renting the series is completely worth it.

In my opinion, it is one of the most original, dark comedy/dramas ever written, and perfectly cast with Peter Krause, the oldest brother, Richard C. Hall, the younger brother, Lauren Ambrose, the little sister who drives a lime green herse, the fantastic Frances Conroy as their eccentric mother, and Richard Jensen as the father. Perfection.

Each episode begins with the death of a client, and is a sub-plot that intersects with the main plot, but usually briefly to allow an insight, but the show focuses on the living and their humanness, except for the wonderful Richard Jensen, who plays the father, and himself in another form.

When my friend asked me how I liked it, I told him I loved it, and especially loved the opening credits. He told me he loved them, too!

When I was putting away the first CD, I noticed on the label  the first cut was ""Opening Credits."" Apparently, many other viewers loved the credits, also.

The music is phenominal. And you sense not one second, one note, one image is wasted, and everything from the time the  oboe, and all the imagery begins, is used to convey the expertly blended essence of the series; love, separation, heartbreak, humor, whimsey, darkness, (but not evil), and renewal.

I didn't love it. I'm IN love!

45191,6331,3329,"Mathayus is a warrior from the Akkadian Empire trained into the Order of the Black Scorpion. There are a few glaring historical mistakes during the series, such as the Akkadian Empire ended around 2300 BC yet the lands between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers is described as 'desert' but back then it was rich grasslands, a bread basket, the Cradle of Civilization; it wasn't until the end of the Bronze Age which was about 1200 BC that the area of modern day Iraq began to turn to desert. Also, throughout the series we see Roman Armor and Medieval castles. We also see sword designs which would never survive in battle and armor which is totally fantastic. But all that aside, the series is not half bad although it must be considered a B-Movie series including skimpy outfits and sometimes cheesy lines. They fight scenes are pretty good. There is no frontal nudity although there are some suggestive dialog and situations.

The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior is the origin-story of Mathayus, the protaganist of the series. His co-star is a tom boyish kick butt girl and there is also another hard fighting character that is a goddess of love and war featured in the story. Mathayus' father is murdered by Black Magic and Mathayus sets out to revenge his father's death, traveling to the Underworld to retrieve a magic sword to kill his nemesis.

The Scorpion King stars The Rock and is the only film he appears in. An evil king is trying to take over the world, and doing quite nicely as he is using a sorceress who can foresee the future to tell him when to attack. A unit of Scorpion Warriors are hired as mercs to stop the evil King.

The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption stars Victor Webster as Mathayus after he loses his Wife and Kingdom. In this movie Mathayus goes to India and fights a guy who summons three dead heroes to aide him in conquering all of India. Mathayus teams up with a The Cobra who is fighting a guerrilla war against the bad guy. Again there are two tough female fighters in this movie with great fight scenes between them.

The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power again stars Victor Webster as Mathayus. In this movie our hero teams up with a displaced Princess and her crazy tinkerer father to over throw a power mad King and reinstate the rightful line onto the throne of a European mountain kingdom.

While some of these things do occur in today's monster movies, like, why do vehicles always stall when you're trying to get away from danger? And it amazes me to no end as to why people just stand there with their mouths open doing nothing when a creature is getting ready to attack them, or even just make an inept attempt to protect themselves by throwing their hands up over themselves looking positively silly when a big, bad monster is getting ready to eat them. In this particular movie, in a scene where people were running around trying to escape the town being overrun with giant scorpions, while carrying large baskets or other household items in their hands. One would think that when you're trying to get away from a monster, you're not going to take the time to gather a giant basket making it extremely difficult to run. Lots of little things like this goes on in this movie, but it was just all part of the fun of the fifties, where it seemed to never occur to anyone that bugs could dig their way out of a hole in the ground, no matter how many piles of dirt you cover of the entrance with.

Came across it here on Amazon by accident while looking for another film, and immediately added it to my cart! A very underrated and fairly unknown film that stars Hugh Grant long before he became a famous person. It is the story of two young men who meet at university, and discover that they have feelings for one another, and ultimately fall in love. The story is set in England of the early 1900s, a time and place when being gay was absolutely not accepted, and thus forces them to become extremely closeted, which in turn leads you down the road of frustration and drama that goes with it. Although this is a gay themed movie which may not be everyone's cup of tea, what makes this move a great film, is that the director focuses on telling the dramatic story of the individuals as persons, who are trying to navigate something new and foreign to them, and the trials and tribulations of not being able to openly be who you are, for fear of being imprisoned and bringing shame upon your family. The focus is not on the ""gayness"" so to speak, but serves at the back-drop to the tragedy and triumph of the characters. There is some light nudity in the film, but nothing remotely comparable to the nudity and gratuitous sex seen in the films of today, or even on television for that matter. With that said, I don't think it is an appropriate movie for children, but rather for mature audiences.

45218,5437,790,"This is exactly the type of film I love:  One involving supernatural elements and some amount of ""horror"", but presented within a framework of firm reality.  This film is about a court trial in which the defendant, a priest, is accused of negligent homicide when a woman upon whom he performed an exorcism dies.  The film presents the story as it would be seen in real life, by real people.  Such a presentation always provokes in me a much greater level of genuine thoughtfulness than the films which only show the sensational and gory events.  Those type of slash-and-stab films really provoke no thought at all--once you've seen them, you're over and done.  This one lingers a bit, and leaves you with a faint aura well after it ends.  It's a pleasant aura, based in wonder, and in a primal yearning to know more than we know.

Laura Linney is superb, as always.  All the actors are excellent.  The exorcism scenes, though relatively few, are effective and seem real (going by imagination, as I have never seen one).

The movie is too long and was filmed and plotted in a confusing, slow, plodding way that sometimes resembled television rather than cinema, but it's worth watching just for the ethical and philosophical issues it raises regarding artificial intelligence, as well as the special effects and the vision of a dystopic, Idiocracy-type future.
As with a far better and more ominous movie on this topic, Ex Machina, we see that the AI synthbot/android industry hasn't learned the lessons of the book Frankenstein.
Creating artificial life forms that have simulated or actual consciousness, ego, and self-awareness is cruel, insane, and dangerous.
Check out the Sam Harris podcasts about AI. You will see that even those who want to profit from it warn that AI androids could overwhelm actual humans, as was shown in Ex Machina.

It is another feel-good gobbledy-gook pseudo-science thing which begins where it ends. It is an exercise in human vanity and nothing else. Looking at the script, it looks to me as if some of the writers were actually making fun of it or the audience.
Examples:
(*) ""robots did not consume resources beyond their first manufacture"" -- because we know machines like cars and appliances don't need energy.
(*)  ""so essential an economic link in the chainmail of society"" -- which is such a mixed metaphor (armored economies?) it means nothing at all.

So, the ""boy"" (played by a boy of course) wants to be a boy, just like all the horrible people he met on his journey. Where does that get you? Maybe he should want to be one of the aliens.
The script and plot was either written as a deliberate insult to its audience or was simply an amalgam of thoughtless edits by different people.

45283,102,3247,"RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, ""Valhalla Rising takes place in the 11th century where a one-eyed mute thrall (Mads Mikkelsen) obtains his freedom in the Scottish Highlands and joins a band of Viking Christians on a voyage to the Holy Land to fight in the Crusades, but the expedition doesnt go as planned.

The movie definitely LOOKS and SOUNDS awesome with an ambient score reminiscent of Agalloch, but without the heavy riffing or manic drumming. Its an artsy non-blockbuster with a tone akin to ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"" (1972) and ""Black Robe"" (1991). Apocalypto (2006) is a good modern comparison, although the story isn't as compelling as Black Robe or Apocalypto. It has elements of Apocalypse Now (1979) but the thin story just isn't anywhere near as fascinating. Still, its okay.

There are some weak points, like the Viking chief saying ""It's a river"" when this would've been obvious about an hour earlier when the mist first cleared (aduh). I'm sure the director would chalk it up to artistic license. Another issue is that the film is slow with not enough events to justify its runtime. As such, we get needlessly drawn-out scenes like the discovery of fresh water (which was obvious from the get-go of the sequence). The whole episode couldve been done in a third of the time given.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in Scotland. WRITERS: Refn, Roy Jacobsen and Matthew Read.

GRADE: B

INTERPRETATION ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Dont read further unless youve seen the movie).

The silent One-Eye is the incarnation of Odin. He is invincible and holds the power to see the future. He disdains the Christian Vikings whove usurped his influence over his people. He tests many in battle to see if they're worthy, but finds none. Nevertheless, he sullenly sees his people off to their new (holy) land, America, where Scandinavians were the third most numerous immigrants. The Boy is a type of Thor, his son, who will sort of replace him in America once the grim god ironically sacrifices himself  la Jesus Christ.",1525564800,4,releas 2009 direct nicola wind refn valhalla rise take place 11th centuri oneey mute thrall mad mikkelsen obtain freedom scottish highland join band vike christian voyag holi land fight crusad expedit doesnt go plan movi definit look sound awesom ambient score reminisc agalloch without heavi rif manic drum artsi nonblockbust tone akin aguirr wrath god 1972 black robe 1991 apocalypto 2006 good modern comparison although stori isnt compel black robe apocalypto element apocalyps 1979 thin stori isnt anywher near fascin still okay weak point like vike chief say river wouldv obviou hour earlier mist first clear aduh im sure director would chalk artist licens anoth issu film slow enough event justifi runtim get needlessli drawnout scene like discoveri fresh water obviou getgo sequenc whole episod couldv done third time given movi run 1 hour 33 minut shot scotland writer refn roy jacobsen matthew read grade b interpret spoiler alert dont read unless youv seen movi silent oneey incarn odin invinc hold power see futur disdain christian vike whove usurp influenc peopl test mani battl see theyr worthi

45373,254,4143,"Movie 8 of 1977 and 49 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

First half hour: aimless, focus on the mundane. My generation has many distractions. Not quite as many as millennials but more than the baby boomers I would say. Is my alternative sources for amusement making it hard to enjoy ""3 Women?"" Despite this unimpressive beginning there is a sense from the direction and music that something is bound to happen and for that it was able to keep my interests although my patience began to wear pretty thin.
After long, pointless meandering I couldn't help but wonder how long I could take it. I was fearful that if I turned it off I would never come back. A small flicker of odious contempt began to build in me if I detected that my time and attention was being wasted. At the point of the film where we go to the hang out - the bar, when we see the foam being blown off the beer, along with some questionable character motives that give a semblance of melodrama on the horizon, I couldn't help but predict that my ability to finish the film was in question. I couldn't help but wonder if Altman really deserved my time.
At the 43 minute mark I have been given two recipes, the process of getting a new room mate, a list of who owns what property, and a ""cute guy"" with a bad cold. I could list more but I think it's not hard to see that even if this is set up it doesn't matter. This isn't even artsy fartsy it's just straight up boring. It was funded because Robert Altman's name was on it. I mentioned earlier that I could not get through Gosford Park. It is a rare feat to get me to walk out on a movie but he got the job done with that one. Why should I invest in this movie? Because people say that Altman makes great movies? I'm not seeing it. If you like ""3 Women"" then I have a short story to tell you that you're are going to love. Now Robert Altman didn't write it but I think I got the goods. So here it goes: I am almost out of toothpaste, I shave my head every three days in the summer, I drive two hours a day, my dog sleeps too much, I hate having a data limit, almost time to buy new shoes! Don't worry, that was all set up. I'll tell you how it ends by the end of my review, I'm sure you are curious.
So my prediction was this: this story has one or two ideas that Altman had in mind but couldn't make a complete story for them so all of this domestic pablum was filler until we get to the heart of the matter.
An hour in and potential substance! So we have twins, Pinky obsessing with Millie, wearing Mille's clothes, reading millie's diary, clocking out with Millie's time card. I read that ""3 Women"" came to Altman in a dream. Wow! Altman dreams Igmar Bergman films? That's cool! I suppose you could make the same accusation toward ""Mulholland Drive"" and I love that movie but no dinner plans fall through in it, actual interesting things happen. I'm all for inspiration and tipping your hat just don't bore me please!
All of the issues of the vast majority of the film not withstanding one has to recognize the final forty minutes as sheer genius. It was truly fascinating to watch. It didn't save the movie in my mind but I loved it. Especially the dream sequence.
Another knock against the film is that it is ultimately pointless. I imagine one could be inventive and make one up but it would hardly be worth the effort in my eyes.

Pros
-final act was very good
-Spacek's acting was splendid
-very satisfying dream sequence
Cons
-calling this ""inspired"" by ""Persona"" is too generous. I think the better word is ""derivative.""
-very boring
-too long
-pointless

45380,54,5170,"The entire agenda of this movie is to make a commentary about how stupid they think Christianity is.
It's actually really ironic, because adversely, they are basically saying that lying somehow makes you more intelligent and ethical than other people.

In reality, we live in a world of liars, and selfish people, and the rare individuals are the ones who are honest and sincere, and acknowledge God in our lives.
This movie attempts to flip the world upside down, making the entire planet honest and extremely happy, but dumb and shallow, and yet, the guy who is the exception to the rule, is somehow painted as a Jesus-like figure who goes around telling people lies about absolutely everything, and yet is extremely miserable.

It's sad that there are persons in power who will go to these lengths to create a narrative that the Biblical account is simply some story someone made up, rather than acknowledging the history, testimony, archaeology, and science, behind what they are trying to demean.
Yet, another intense irony, if they don't believe in God, then why do they care AT ALL about spending their entire lives trying to refute the facts?

Logic can't justify Anti-Logic, but somehow these kinds of people spend all their time desperately trying to convince you that there is no meaning to our lives.
If there's no meaning, then the statement is meaningless, and therefore refuted, it just doesn't work any way you try to reason it out.

It really says something about their state-of-mind.
The concept of this movie is sound, the inversion being something like ""Liar, Liar"", but the agenda, and all the depicted misery, just made it tacky and dull.

It's interesting how, as comedians age, they seem to get darker and darker.

It is about what many young people fantasize about in their own lives; at least back when it came out. I was a teenager when this came out and we always used to argue about with whom we would like to get stuck on a deserted tropical island and for the most part, this had been brought to the big screen for all of us. For some, including myself, the sight of Brooke Shields running around in her skimpy attire stoked the fire of teen yearnings and my wife says the same of Christoper Atkins. Brooke was the one of the most beautiful girls we had ever seen at our age and the movie really tickled our funny-bone.

The acting is childish and novice to some, but remember that they were marooned on the island as small children and essentially were stuck in a state of arrested adolescence. The scenery is lush and tropical and the handmade home on the beach was the thing of young dreams. Reward yourself with this silly, but sentimental film about the carefree days of youth.

45519,580,2122,"Clint Eastwood excellently leads political intrigue in Absolute Power.

Absolute Power is one of Clint Eastwood's best movies. It is a highly relevant crime thriller about a thief, played by Eastwood, who witnesses a crime. He struggles with moral boundaries that implicate people in high places. It is a highly entertaining role for Eastwood who displays a lot of charisma.

The supporting cast really performances well with Gene Hackman playing a corrupt political figure that will remind you of his Lex Luthor back in Superman. Hackman is devilishly rotten and so very engaging. Ed Harris is the resolute police detective that must solve the case and he plays it cool as ever. Laura Linney is really relatable and grounds Eastwood's character nicely as his daughter. Scott Glenn has a particularly intriguing Secret Service character that feels like a great foil to Hackman. Absolute Power revels in its brilliant cast and their delightful acting.

The costumes are accurate and pretty neatly arranged in Absolute Power. The music goes from tense to unnerving in the background. It is quickly edited and leads to a fast paced thriller atmosphere. The cinematography is quite clever, often making you feel like you are there with Eastwood.

Overall, Clint Eastwood directs Absolute Power with a great deal of care and clever camera angles. The performances are all quite good and standouts in their respective careers. While Absolute Power is mostly forgotten to time, it is well worth revisiting for the political relevance, mystery, intrigue, and acting. It is better than other reviews are saying by far.",1525651200,4,clint eastwood excel lead polit intrigu absolut power absolut power one clint eastwood best movi highli relev crime thriller thief play eastwood wit crime struggl moral boundari implic peopl high place highli entertain role eastwood display lot charisma support cast realli perform well gene hackman play corrupt polit figur remind lex luthor back superman hackman devilishli rotten engag ed harri resolut polic detect must solv case play cool ever laura linney realli relat ground eastwood charact nice daughter scott glenn particularli intrigu secret servic charact feel like great foil hackman absolut power revel brilliant cast delight act costum accur pretti neatli arrang absolut power music goe ten unnerv background quickli edit lead fast pace thriller atmospher cinematographi quit clever often make feel like eastwood overal clint eastwood direct absolut power great deal care clever camera angl perform quit good standout respect career absolut power mostli forgotten time well worth revisit polit relev mysteri intrigu act better review say far

45582,2198,4910,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere, which makes this all the more sad upon knowing that this movie could possibly be one of Studio Ghibli's last films. Although Miyazaki wasn't in the director's chair this time around, I still had high hopes, since Hiromasa Yonebayashi also directed ""The Secret World of Arrietty""--another favorite of mine. And much like said film, this story is less action and more emotional drama as one girl discovers her family's past in the most magical and unlikely of ways.

Anna is an extremely introverted 12-year-old girl living in Sapporo, Japan with her foster parents. One day at school, she collapses from an asthma attack, upon which her foster parents decide to send her to live with their relatives for the summer; hoping that the clear air of the seaside town will help her ailment, and that the change in scenery will help lift her spirits (as she's becoming exponentially withdrawn and shutting out everyone as of late). Upon arrival, Anna soon discovers a seemingly abandoned mansion across a salt marsh--one that she, strangely enough, feels drawn to. But over a period of days, she constantly spots a young, blonde girl in the house. Finally, one fateful night, the two girls manage to meet each other, and the mysterious girl introduces herself as Marnie. And as the two quickly befriend each other and learn more about one another, Anna will slowly solve the mystery of Marnie's sporadic appearances....and just what exactly happened to her family.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Miyazaki film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible, and it makes scenes come alive in such a way that the lines between fantasy and reality become more and more blurred. Even something as mundane as an abandoned house is made interesting because of the lovely artwork.

And the plot is just as awe-inspiring, as this film features two of the most real and relatable characters I've ever come across, even more so if you've ever been in a less-than-perfect family situation. Both girls instantly connect over their similar situations, from having parents that are either dead or never around, to feeling inadequate, unlovable, and a burden to the people charged with taking care of them. But over the course of one eventful summer, these two will come to realize their own self worth, and that the bonds of family can transcend generations.

With a plot that has a great suspenseful mystery with constant twists and turns, this is the perfect film to watch if you, at any time in your life, have ever felt ""not good enough"", or have felt some kind of disconnect with your family. Sometimes, only by confronting our past can we ever move on, and sometimes, your past is actually much closer than you think.",1525651200,5,anyon fan lover anim seen least one film studio ghibli acclaim writer director hayao miyazaki beauti stun movi known world inspir artist everywher make sad upon know movi could possibl one studio ghibli last film although miyazaki wasnt director chair time around still high hope sinc hiromasa yonebayashi also direct secret world arriettyanoth favorit mine much like said film stori le action emot drama one girl discov famili past magic unlik way anna extrem introvert 12yearold girl live sapporo japan foster parent one day school collaps asthma attack upon foster parent decid send live rel summer hope clear air seasid town help ailment chang sceneri help lift spirit she becom exponenti withdrawn shut everyon late upon arriv anna soon discov seemingli abandon mansion across salt marshon strang enough feel drawn period day constantli spot young blond girl hous final one fate night two girl manag meet mysteri girl introduc marni two quickli befriend learn one anoth anna slowli solv mysteri marni sporad appearancesand exactli happen famili visual anim per usual miyazaki film utterli breathtak

45584,2262,4565,"Impossibly slow ""parallel reality"" tale that devolves into...I don't know what.  You can follow the story easily enough; but the film is SLOW and keeps piling on ""clever"" twists until you forget (or never even knew) its original objective.

Lead actors David CarranzaandTiffany Mualem play dual roles, as themselves (as actors) in two different dramatic TV series AND as two television viewers (Alex and Samantha) who are watching the two TV series.  That's the premise...Lost yet?

Unexpectedly, Alex and Samantha see each other directly through the TV screen, like unintended Skype.  That is to say, Alex sees Samantha at home watching the TV, and Samantha sees Alex at home watching TV.  They mistake each other for the actors, David CarranzaandTiffany Mualem.  Lost yet?

It gradually dawns on the two viewers that the TV series they are watching are actually real, that they're watching each other's lives unfold.

It gets worse.  Samantha dies in real life and Alex plays reruns of her TV series in a continuous loop on his TV to keep her alive.  As it turns out, some sort of evil psychotherapist/drug-cartel/screenwriter DEMON is engineering the whole thing.

Now I KNOW you're lost.

You CAN follow this, but the story is inundated with ""WTF is going on?"" moments, even AFTER you understand what's going on.  It drags on forever, the story adding new twists and more twists and no resolution in sight, and it's not helpful that David CarranzaandTiffany Mualem don't have any acting range...Mualem has a wide-eyed, blank expression while Carranza has a painfully-constipated expression throughout the entire movie.

45704,157,549,"Loosely based (as most low budget 80's movie versions of Stephen King books were) on the Junior/YP novellete Cycle of the Werewolf, which basically was a kids/teen audience short story padded out with illustration pages.  This early 80's (set in the late 70's) movie is a rarity, where the main character has a physical disability (he's paralyzed from the waist down and confined to a wheel chair).  So that's refreshing in itself and worth the rental/purchase price alone.  The movie does have a very 80's look to it, the wheelchairs aren't the type used anymore, and The Silver Bullet (the awesome invention the boy's uncle makes for him) is actually pretty common if not a little obsolete in these days of golf cart type mobility vehicles for the disabled. The dialogue was politically correct for its time with Marty referred to by even his own family who love and are overprotective of him as a cripple, but may be offensive to oversensitive viewers today.  But saying that for a horror film, there's no nudity, no sex scenes, not much blood and gore, and the werewolf in the days before CGI, well looks pretty fake.  So the oversensitive viewer should actually like this one.

The movie is also further dated by the fact that kids are allowed to journey outside for hours on their own (even Marty) and no parents freak out. This is the era I was a little kid in it and it was awesome.  Today parents freak out when their in mid conversation with a kid and it moves out of eyesight into the next aisle of a department store. But the 80's feel to it adds something to the enjoyment factor.  Basically the plot has a number of residents being killed off by an attacker in a small town.  Marty (Corey Haim) believes it to be a werewolf but his family doesn't believe him, even his uncle Red (Gary Busey) who often while drunk, treats him more like a regular kid than his parents do.  Marty's older sister Jane (Megan Follows - the title character actress from Anne of Green Gables/Avonlea) also lives with the frustration that Marty can do no wrong in her mother's eyes, and any interactions with him are her fault.  Marty is getting annoyed with the werewolf after it's actions cost him a best friend, as well as the only girl interested in him to leave town.  He wants it dead but is going to need the help of his fed up with him sister, as well as his drunk uncle to end it's rein of terror.

It's low budget, the father of a victim wears the same suit he wore to work when he found out for the rest of the film no matter what the circumstance for example.  Sort of like kids putting on a school play, here's your costume and you wear if the whole time.  So it sort of oozes a fair bit of cheesiness but it all adds to the fun.",1525737600,4,loo base low budget 80 movi version stephen king book junioryp novellet cycl werewolf basic kidsteen audienc short stori pad illustr page earli 80 set late 70 movi rariti main charact physic disabl he paralyz waist confin wheel chair that refresh worth rentalpurchas price alon movi 80 look wheelchair arent type use anymor silver bullet awesom invent boy uncl make actual pretti common littl obsolet day golf cart type mobil vehicl disabl dialogu polit correct time marti refer even famili love overprotect crippl may offens oversensit viewer today say horror film there nuditi sex scene much blood gore werewolf day cgi well look pretti fake oversensit viewer actual like one movi also date fact kid allow journey outsid hour even marti parent freak era littl kid awesom today parent freak mid convers kid move eyesight next aisl depart store 80 feel add someth enjoy factor basic plot number resid kill attack
45705,102,549,"RELEASED IN 1985 and directed by Daniel Attias, ""Silver Bullet"" chronicles events in a small town in Eastern America when a ferocious werewolf starts picking people off one-by-one. Corey Haim and Megan Follows play the adolescent brother/sister protagonists, the boy being a paraplegic. Gary Busey appears as the amiable alcoholic uncle while Robin Groves plays the mother. Everett McGill is on hand as a prominent minister while Terry O'Quinn appears as the sheriff.

Stephen King wrote both the novella and the screenplay and so the movie has the comic book vibe of movies based on Kings works. The townspeople are unsurprisingly cartoonish, but the main family is well done, i.e. realistic. In any case, Silver Bullet seems quaint compared to the three werewolf flicks of 1981: The Howling, An American Werewolf in London and Wolfen (of course the latter wasn't strictly a werewolf flick, if at all). Nevertheless, I appreciate the old fashioned take on the subject and the warmth of the family members. The werewolf is Grade B when fully revealed, but certainly formidable.

The film conveys cinematic stereotypes, like the goodhearted drunk (or prostitute) and the corrupt civic leader, who puts on a fake smile for the community while being a savage beast within. Although theres some truth to these depictions, most of the time a drunkard is an alcoholic because his/her heart is desperately flawed. And the bulk of respected community leaders aren't evil incarnate. Yet I like the way the movie shows how everything is not necessarily as it appears.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 35 minutes and was shot in North Carolina (Burgaw, Leland, Wilmington, Castle Hayne and Carolina Beach).

45725,199,799,"I didn't have a deep connection with LOTR until it was revealed in 2016 just how corrupted, widespread and impregnable the establishment of Washington DC had become. It has been earth-shaking to see how career politicians along with the hierarchy of the intelligence community have been working hand in hand with the mainstream media to overturn a Presidential Election. How could this be happening in the USA? Over the last few years I have seen true evil that I had never experienced before. The worst part is the helplessness of watching it all happen. I've never understood the true reality of what helplessness feels like. Now I feel that connection with the essence of Tolkien's story- the fear of helplessness and the means of overcoming an enemy so great and powerful. LOTR always seemed too clichd before. It was the same old story of good triumphing over evil. But now that I've experienced the Washington Establishment and mainstream media and felt their malicious power I understand the existence of how hard it is to rise up and defeat something so huge. I understand how average people are scared to act because of their striking vulnerability. We literally have black-masked villains threatening groups who want to stand against the establishment. This would've never seemed possible to me years ago. I would've mistakenly presumed that people in the US wouldn't stand for corruption. But now I see how it's a person's vulnerability that keeps them from acting. To actually rise up and fight takes so much more than I ever thought possible. Because of these things LOTR has become a major inspiration for me. Whereas before I saw it as too grand and clichd, now I see it as the perfect portrayal. The whole idea comes down to good people finding their courage and coming together to defeat evil. It's a clich, but it has become real again.",1525737600,5,didnt deep connect lotr reveal 2016 corrupt widespread impregn establish washington dc becom earthshak see career politician along hierarchi intellig commun work hand hand mainstream medium overturn presidenti elect could happen usa last year seen true evil never experienc worst part helpless watch happen ive never understood true realiti helpless feel like feel connect essenc tolkien stori fear helpless mean overcom enemi great power lotr alway seem clichd old stori good triumph evil ive experienc washington establish mainstream medium felt malici power understand exist hard rise defeat someth huge understand averag peopl scare act strike vulner liter blackmask villain threaten group want stand establish wouldv never seem possibl year ago wouldv mistakenli presum peopl u wouldnt stand corrupt see person vulner keep act actual rise fight take much ever thought possibl thing lotr becom major inspir wherea saw grand clichd see perfect portray whole idea come good peopl find

45751,2205,5701,"I have watched a lot of war movies. For some reason I really got involved with the characters in this one. Other viewers have mentioned that the ending is contrived as are several other scenes. I also have to admit that I was confused, at first, about who was who. The two lead actors look very similar and it took me awhile to tell them apart. I like that there was not a lot of blood and gore. Don't think it's necessary just because someone is hurt or been killed.

Thought the battle scenes were well done. The battle at the end of the third episode is especially nerve wracking. I felt I was in the middle of the battle with the characters and yet looking at it from afar. There are some typical hand wringing moments when you're hoping for a good outcome but know that all is probably not going to go well.

I think this might be a good movie to see with teens and young adults. Many times the realities of war get lost in all the politics and nation bashing. It would do us all good, especially for the people who send us out to fight, to think about those fighting and those waiting for them to come home.

I feel the casting was done just right and I think Woody Harrelson and Randy Quaid fit the roles just right, possibly even better than Jim Carrey and Chris Farley who were rumored to be potential choices for the roles. The film is a ""dumb"" comedy in the vein of ""Dumb and Dumber"" and relies on gross gag humor but I don't feel as if it's overdone in this film as in others in this genre, possibly to keep the PG-13 rating. Adding Bill Murray as the antagonist was great casting and helps spark the film. I gave this movie three stars for the genre it's in. No, it's not a brilliant comedy or anything close to groundbreaking humor but it gets the job done for the crowd and fan base it is intended for.  Instead of most comedies where jokes are thrown in here and there or worked up, Farrelly bros. movies treat each scene as a skit. Overall, good comedy for it's time. Although I personally like the casting choices I wonder if the film would've done much better in the box office if they would've  chosen Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels (still hot off of Dumb and Dumber).",1525737600,3,classic farrelli brother comedi 90 still doesnt feel date feel cast done right think woodi harrelson randi quaid fit role right possibl even better jim carrey chri farley rumor potenti choic role film dumb comedi vein dumb dumber reli gross gag humor dont feel overdon film other genr possibl keep pg13 rate ad bill murray antagonist great cast help spark film gave movi three star genr brilliant comedi anyth close groundbreak humor get job done crowd fan base intend instead comedi joke thrown work farrelli bro movi treat scene skit overal good comedi time although person like cast choic wonder film wouldv done much better box offic wouldv chosen jim carrey jeff daniel still hot dumb dumber

(I can't believe that Albee actually wrote those into the original play. I'll have to look into that.) And then there's Liz Taylor's makeup, which was sloppily applied and made her look older than need be. Another problem: Sandy Dennis won the best supporting actress Oscar for this unimpressive, lethargic perfomance. She definitely falls short of the mark. (Of course, this was a little early in her movie career. After this, she went on to do wonderful work in both drama [Up the Downstair's Case] and comedy [The Out of Towners].)",1525824000,4,im surmis stage version one set lead protagonist live room kept movi live room roadhous backyard stuff distract unnecessarili took away tension also found taylor burton soliloquy ineffect cant believ albe actual wrote origin play ill look there liz taylor makeup sloppili appli made look older need anoth problem sandi denni best support actress oscar unimpress letharg perfom definit fall short mark cours littl earli movi career went wonder work drama downstair case comedi towner

Just seemed like the script was really poorly done.
There is almost no narrative to the film.

Spoiler Alert on the only interesting thing in the movie, which was when he walked into the Chicago Police Station, to the unit dedicated to his capture, and asked for the Baseball score. (LoL)
I tried to find out if that happened, or not, but no one is talking about it online. (seems fake)

Maybe that's because things tend to shine when you have too much wine. And some of the jokes were like the kind that pop up in Woody Allen movies. You know, the ones that go over the heads of 90 percent of the audience, while the other 10 percent know who Bukowski is and have read Confederacy of Dunces. Plus the music was more than a bit bland.
  Having said that, all of the principles were terrific. Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh give performances that will always rank very high on their resumes. Very smartly written, and very deftly directed by Alexander Payne. This movie is a gem. A flawed gem, but one that still shines brightly. And it really made me laugh.
  Now it's conspiracy theory time! As I watched this movie for the second time, I could not but help notice several stylistic and referential touches that tend to call up my personal favorite movie of all time. And that film is..............The Shining!!! Hear me out: Did you notice that the segments dividing the film into different days -MONDAY- or-THURSDAY- are just like in The Shining? Plus Sideways deals with a schoolteacher who is an unsuccessful writer on the side, along with a drinking problem and issues with women. He's friends with someone named Jack. You see a car winding along a road. The motel room Miles and Jack stay in is number 234, just three numbers away to the left is.......237! There is a reference early on to a Wendy and twins. A guy talks to a bartender. Several scenes have characters looking into or reflected in mirrors. Plus, you could say that Miles and Jack both finally have a chance to accomplish something, and are really into their ""work"". And an ambiguous ending to boot. Maybe this is really reading way too much into this flick, but perhaps Alexander Payne was telling an alternate version of The Shining, one far less Kubrickian. Or maybe he just digs that movie. Or maybe it's all one big massive coincidence. Or maybe.......
  Anyhoo, this movie can still be enjoyed as a funny, smartly made road trip comedy without the aforementioned ""overlooked"" subtext. But perhaps, perhaps, this film is the skeleton key, if you will, to open up all the secrets of Kubrick's 1980 masterpiece of horror. Take a closer look for yourself. You never know.----------------PEACE

45924,338,5118,"These films are fun to watch. They are filled with action, ancient Greek myths, magic, superstition, misbehaving gods, impossible acts and impossible animals, and more. The 1981 Clash of the Titans is a good example of the three films on this disc. With an open mind and a desire to watch adventure, viewers will find it delightful. The basis for the film is the belief that the gods are fallible and do quite a number of things that are improper and immoral. It is also based on the idea that the Titans controlled everything before the gods took over control and imprisoned the Titans. Zeus, the head of the gods, travels around and seduces or rapes young girls. Many of the girls give birth to children who are half gods. Perseus, the protagonist in this film, is the offspring of such a union. Zeus wants to protect him and orders the gods to give him magical items to protect him, such as a helmet that makes him invisible, a sword that can cut into marble, a super strong shield, and an owl that can lead him to where he wants to go. Later, Perseus is also able to tame Pegasus, the winged horse which can fly him to where he wants to go.
Zeus' wife Hera also has a son, Calibos, and is mad at Zeus for failing to give him gifts. In fact, Zeus turns him into an ugly creature. Before the turning, he was very handsome and the most-beautiful virgin Andromeda was willing to marry him. But no longer. Now, Perseus wants to marry her, and she wants to marry Perseus. Calibos decides to do all he can to stop the nuptials. Among other acts, he captures Pegasus. He gets help from his mom and other gods. They arrange it so that in 30 days Andromeda must be given to a Titan as a virgin. Perseus sets out on several adventures to stop the gift, including finding three witches, finding a being that if you look at her you are turned to stone, visiting the land of the dead, and more.",1525824000,4,film fun watch fill action ancient greek myth magic superstit misbehav god imposs act imposs anim 1981 clash titan good exampl three film disc open mind desir watch adventur viewer find delight basi film belief god fallibl quit number thing improp immor also base idea titan control everyth god took control imprison titan zeu head god travel around seduc rape young girl mani girl give birth child half god perseu protagonist film offspr union zeu want protect order god give magic item protect helmet make invis sword cut marbl super strong shield owl lead want go later perseu also abl tame pegasu wing hors fli want go zeu wife hera also son calibo mad zeu fail give gift fact zeu turn ugli creatur turn handsom mostbeauti virgin andromeda will marri longer perseu want marri want marri perseu calibo decid stop nuptial among act captur pegasu get help mom god

The dialogue is at times clunky, but visually the film is a treat (though some of the CGI from 2000 has not aged well). Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise, Don Cheadle, and Jerry O'Connell are all likable in their roles and help save some of the iffy lines through their commitment and likability. The overall plot resembles that of the earlier ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or the later ""Interstellar"" as it explores our place in the solar system and, by extension, the universe. It poses questions about the nature of life and plays with the iconic Martian ""face"" that the Viking landers photographed in the Cydonia region. While Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" were more scientifically accurate, this is a fun film. Interestingly, ""Mission to Mars"" came out at the same time as Antony Hoffman's ""Red Planet,"" demonstrating a demand for more realistic science fiction (even if both films were critical flops).",1525824000,5,brian de palma mission mar focus man mission mar go awri 2020 dialogu time clunki visual film treat though cgi 2000 age well tim robbin gari sinis cheadl jerri oconnel likabl role help save iffi line commit likabl overal plot resembl earlier 2001 space odyssey later interstellar explor place solar system extens univers pose question natur life play icon martian face vike lander photograph cydonia region ridley scott martian christoph nolan interstellar scientif accur fun film interestingli mission mar came time antoni hoffman red planet demonstr demand realist scienc fiction even film critic flop

45963,102,817,"RELEASED IN 1957 and directed by Delmer Daves, ""3:10 to Yuma is a Western about a struggling Arizona rancher, Dan Evans (Van Heflin), who has no choice but to hire-on as an escort of dangerous, but charismatic outlaw, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford). Wade proceeds to employ psychological manipulation in order to corrupt the righteous family man and escape.

This is a quality psychological Western from the 50s, only held back by the B&W photography. The Arizona landscapes are spectacular but they're all for naught due to this flat B&W presentation. Nevertheless, the story & characters are great. The mind games Wade plays with Evans keeps things interesting. Felicia Farr, the hottie from Glenn Fords excellent Jubal (1956) is on hand as a bartender who has a thang for bad boys. Im not complaining about her role, but its a tad unlikely that such a smoking hot woman would be alone for too long in the Old West where there were twenty times more men than women.

Most old Western theme songs are hopelessly hokey, e.g. North to Alaska (1960) (a great Western), but the one here sung by Frankie Laine is very good. I like it when words that don't rhyme are made to rhyme in a song: ""There's a legend and a ruma', when you take the 3:10 to Yuma.""

The 2007 remake with Christian Bale and Russell Crowe in the Evans/Wade roles takes the template of this film and makes a superior Western with more action and deeper themes, not to mention IN COLOR.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Arizona (Old Tucson,, Contention City, Sedona, etc.) and the studio ranch in Burbank, California. WRITERS: Halsted Welles (screenplay) and Elmore Leonard (story).

45989,83,1260,"Source Code is a sci-fi thriller that opens with a man awakening on a train, not knowing why hes there or who the girl is who seems to know him well. Within a few minutes, the train explodes. A scientist, Dr, Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) and his assistant (Vera Farmiga) have assigned Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) to prevent an imminent domestic terrorist attack. A commuter train has been bombed outside Chicago, and the bomber is planning another, similar attack. Stevens is teleported to the recent past, allowing him to inhabit the body and brain of one of the doomed commuters for exactly eight minutes. When those eight minutes are up, the bomb goes off, and Stevens must repeat the process over and over, each time his presence inserted into a different passenger, until he discovers the perpetrator.

The film has a driving energy, with the clock literally counting down again and again. As he repeatedly attempts to find out the identity of the terrorist, Colter gets to know about his fellow passengers, developing empathy with them, particularly a young woman named Christina (Michelle Monaghan). Using a structure similar to Groundhog Day, director Duncan Jones avoids boring the viewer with repetition by providing new information in each of Colters eight-minute investigative jaunts.

Source Code is not only a gripping thriller, but a cautionary tale about the dark side of scientific advances and human decency as a counterbalance. Though Colter is, in a sense, a pawn in a much larger game, he is the one who is essential in the process. Unlike many science fiction stores, man has not become unnecessary in a world ruled by technology.

46045,1066,715,"The film is ruined by two separate instances, by two separate characters graphically describing their engaging in oral-sex with someone else, which assaults the innocence of the viewer.
  The film sheds insight into why mathematician and code-breaker, Alan Turing, became a homosexual in his youth. Alan Turing attended boarding-school where he was relentlessly bullied and viciously abused by the older boys. In turn; 40-year-old, Alan Turing, seduced and sodomized a 19-year-old boy, which this propaganda film portrays as okay, rather than immoral.

  The film forgets to portray that six-years before World War 2; the Polish government used espionage to purchase the blueprints for the Enigma machine from a German man for the price of a million-dollars in today's money. The Poles built their own Enigma machine; and built a computer to crack the settings for the Enigma machine; cracked the German Enigma code; and read German coded messages for 6-years prior to World War 2. However, just before the invasion of Poland; the Germans changed their Enigma machine from 3-rotors or wheels of letters; to 5-rotors; multiplying the possibilities of their code beyond the ability of the Pole's small computer to break it. Thus, the Poles were suddenly unable to read coded German messages as the Germans moved to invade Poland. The Poles gave their code-breaking knowledge, and their Enigma machine, and their computer to the British.

  We are all sinners. It might be said of Alan Turing, ""When he was good; he was very good, and when he was bad; he was very bad."" Unlike King David, who committed adultery and conspiracy to murder; Alan Turing did not find God, forgiveness, and the cleansing restoration that only God can give. Alan Turing was a key player in the British breaking the German Enigma code. The Germans increased to eight rotors in some instances, and changed the settings of the Enigma machine every day..

  Alan Turning had a good side and an interesting side. He rode a bicycle to work, but had hay-fever, so he wore a gas-mask while riding his bicycle. His bicycle chain was damaged; would work loose after a while, and fall off. Rather than spend money to replace it; Turing became interested in determining the number of pedal revolutions before the chain would fall-off. Turing counted his pedal revolutions and then got off his bike and adjusted the chain before it fell-off and continued on. It would have been easier to estimate the time, say 7-minutes, but maybe he did not own a wristwatch, but rather an unwieldy pocket-watch. Turing was a very good runner; running past the local running club of star athlete runners one day along the roadway.

  In technical terms of lighting, costumes, sets, and actors; the film is well-done. The story moves at a good pace and keeps your interest. The film is informative as well; explaining some of the code-breaking, which the other movie ""Enigma"" leaves clouded and mysterious. The other movie ""Enigma"" has a scene of graphic sexual-intercourse, which comes unexpectedly and quickly. Many things in life are neither all good or all bad; such as this film.",1525910400,1,film ruin two separ instanc two separ charact graphic describ engag oralsex someon el assault innoc viewer film shed insight mathematician codebreak alan ture becam homosexu youth alan ture attend boardingschool relentlessli bulli vicious abus older boy turn 40yearold alan ture seduc sodom 19yearold boy propaganda film portray okay rather immor film forget portray sixyear world war 2 polish govern use espionag purchas blueprint enigma machin german man price milliondollar today money pole built enigma machin built comput crack set enigma machin crack german enigma code read german code messag 6year prior world war 2 howev invas poland german chang enigma machin 3rotor wheel letter 5rotor multipli possibl code beyond abil pole small comput break thu pole suddenli unabl read code german messag german move invad poland pole gave codebreak knowledg enigma machin comput british sinner might said alan ture good good bad bad unlik king david commit adulteri conspiraci murder alan ture find god forgiv clean restor god give alan ture key player british break german enigma code german increas eight

46049,273,5660,"Better than I expected and filmed in such a way that it comes together nicely in the end if more predictable than I'd have liked. I have to disagree with some of the other reviews here. True Nature isn't scary, there isn't a scene in the film that was frightening to me or inspired a jump. It's a stretch to even call this a supernatural film as the ""super"" part of it doesn't really come into play until the last 15 minutes of the film. But the reason True Nature deserves 4* IMO is because the acting is very well done.

Marianne Porter played her part really well and I was surprised to learn that True Nature is the only full length film she's been in. Reg Land is also good in this film as Marianne's father as well as Carolyn McCormick as Marianne's mother. The pacing is well done and but there is one Reg Land scene in the film that's a dead give away to the twist to the plot. I think this could have been better played to keep the ""guess who, guess what"" aspect going longer. The visual cues to show the results of the central plot were a bit too subtle for my tastes because, in this regard the dots don't connect that well until the very last scene. By then, it's easy not to care.

When it's all said and done though, I enjoyed this film for Marianne's performance more than any other. I have to agree with a reviewer that said this film isn't original and is a take on a plot used in a cult classic from over 20 years ago. In not spoiling it, I won't say which film it is either but that film handles the plot device much better than True Nature even though True Nature is still a good film.",1525910400,4,better expect film way come togeth nice end predict id like disagre review true natur isnt scari isnt scene film frighten inspir jump stretch even call supernatur film super part doesnt realli come play last 15 minut film reason true natur deserv 4 imo act well done mariann porter play part realli well surpris learn true natur full length film she reg land also good film mariann father well carolyn mccormick mariann mother pace well done one reg land scene film that dead give away twist plot think could better play keep guess guess aspect go longer visual cue show result central plot bit subtl tast regard dot dont connect well last scene easi care said done though enjoy film mariann perform agre review said film isnt origin take plot use cult classic 20 year ago spoil wont say film either film handl plot devic much better

46070,7099,1895,"SE7EN + THE ORDER (Heath Ledger) + ANAMORPH (Willem Dafoe), with echoes of SAW, HORSEMEN, PREDESTINATION (Ethan Hawke) and 12 MONKEYS.
^ -- If you enjoyed at least 2-3 of those, SOLACE will be worth a go, it does offer something new.

SOLACE takes the quantum biophysics angle to psychokinesis/precognition (Hopkins by way of Rupert Sheldrake), in which Anthony Hopkin's character - go to heavy hearted FBI clairvoyant - is confronted by another of his kind in the course of solving a series of previously unconnected murders -- a Keizer Soze to Hopkins' PTSD Sherlock Holmes -- the Cosmic Horror invoked by this tempter leading Hopkins along in what ends in either a Faustian pact for which the investigation is merely an initiation, or annihilation -- grows with Hopkins' increasing uncertainty as a pawn in a game where the rules shift with each move . . .

Hopkins provides the most sympathetic iteration of Dr. Lecter on the other side of the fence in SOLACE, and he makes you invest in the supporting cast he looks after too. This should be yet another tired murder mystery drama, but the writing succeeds in transcending with the not-outlandish implementation of this soothsaying ability cast against a primal Trickster with even greater ability. The consequences and questions of the value of time, noble lies, euthanasia, medical consent, consequentialism versus deontological ethical codes it raises serve the end of heightening the psychological thrills and dramatic tension in what is ultimately a poignant, cathartic end not commonly seen in this sort of film's type, casting or budget.",1525910400,5,se7en order heath ledger anamorph willem dafo echo saw horseman predestin ethan hawk 12 monkey enjoy least 23 solac worth go offer someth new solac take quantum biophys angl psychokinesisprecognit hopkin way rupert sheldrak anthoni hopkin charact go heavi heart fbi clairvoy confront anoth kind cours solv seri previous unconnect murder keizer soze hopkin ptsd sherlock holm cosmic horror invok tempter lead hopkin along end either faustian pact investig mere initi annihil grow hopkin increas uncertainti pawn game rule shift move hopkin provid sympathet iter dr lecter side fenc solac make invest support cast look yet anoth tire murder mysteri drama write succe transcend notoutlandish implement soothsay abil cast primal trickster even greater abil consequ question valu time nobl lie euthanasia medic consent consequenti versu deontolog ethic code rais serv end heighten psycholog thrill dramat tension ultim poignant cathart end commonli seen sort film type cast budget

The boy had a name. Why not give the main characters names? It's not like they can stand for every man and every woman. They are distinct, unique characters. If they had names we could reference them easier like Lois Lane.
It is not a good idea to take a toddler with you to a cabin if you plan to spend your time researching and writing. The husband is a counselor or therapist and he doesn't think it's strange that his wife spends her time with her studies while the toddler runs around alone in the woods and plays in the tool shed?

46109,580,26,"Tom Cruise Lights Up This Future Franchise.

Brian DePalma directs Mission Impossible with keen eye for darker noir shots with that falters in its dated 1990's style. The direction is strong as DePalma takes you on a joy ride with espionage, heists, action, and political intrigue. Mission Impossible is interesting in its clever story and twists that will surprise everyone on their first viewing that become obvious on repeat viewings. It's very fun and leads to better movies down the line. This movie does at least introduce to Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in all his brilliance and excitement. These movies are not genius, but they do keep surprising you and remain entertaining to this day.

However, I must note how dated the special effects look in this debut Mission Impossible film with obvious toy sets, cheap CGI, dated special effects, and awkward moments. This was made in the middle of the '90's and you can really tell. From floppy discs and large block cell phones to little computer screens and fat laptops, you are always painfully of the era in which Mission Impossible was filmed. It is distracting, but not movie ruining.

Tonally, Mission Impossible takes itself too seriously. Its hyper sincere attitude is endearing and Cruise keeps you engaged. Although, its atmosphere gets destroyed by how campy the dialogue and acting comes across. So campy in moments, you will likely get taken right out of the experience. If you can accept this, Mission Impossible is worth a single watch to get you to the better sequels.

Most notably, the Mission Impossible score is still fun. Danny Elfman composed a highly memorable theme that you will remember forever. The way it is recorded in this movie is very dated and sounds older with its '90's alternative rock and metal background, but the symphonic elements still stand the test of time. It is a great score for the ages as represented by its continued cultural relevance and its usage in the Mission Impossible sequels.

The acting by Tom Cruise is the highlight as he takes it seriously enough that you believe it, but many of the performances lean of melodrama and poor writing. The supporting cast serves their roles well, but they often fall into the overacting category compared to Cruise who is considerably more reserved in this one. The hyper quick edits and odd close-up shots ruin some of the more sincere moments, but Cruise keeps on believing in this series. He remains the light of the Mission Impossible franchise in contemporary cinema, which you can witness blossom in this premier installment in the Mission Impossible movies.

Mission Impossible has aged poorly with its hard edged editing, too serious tone, campy dialogue, dated technology, and melodrama, but it is a fun spy series that starts off with a twisting thriller and leaps into action fodder. At least, Mission Impossible attempts to deliver a thoughtful story with some actual espionage. DePalma did a nice job in streamlining the story as the plot still works. The narrative is focused enough that you can just enjoy yourself with all this movie's memorable scenes.",1525910400,3,tom cruis light futur franchis brian depalma direct mission imposs keen eye darker noir shot falter date 1990 style direct strong depalma take joy ride espionag heist action polit intrigu mission imposs interest clever stori twist surpris everyon first view becom obviou repeat view fun lead better movi line movi least introduc ethan hunt tom cruis brillianc excit movi geniu keep surpris remain entertain day howev must note date special effect look debut mission imposs film obviou toy set cheap cgi date special effect awkward moment made middl 90 realli tell floppi disc larg block cell phone littl comput screen fat laptop alway pain era mission imposs film distract movi ruin tonal mission imposs take serious hyper sincer attitud endear cruis keep engag although atmospher get destroy campi dialogu act come across campi moment like get taken right experi accept mission imposs worth singl watch get better sequel notabl mission imposs score still fun danni elfman compos highli memor theme rememb forev way record movi date sound older 90 altern rock metal background

46168,2138,2506,"If there is one thing that's been true about movies in America, and American movie goers film watching habits for many a year now is this: Americans love crap. Entertainment-wise that is. We can never get enough of super hero movies, lame chick flicks, cliche-ridden horror movies, prequels, sequels, remakes, reboots, etc. We almost tend to run screaming from anything aspiring to ""art"" in film today. We also tend to act very angrily towards it. This is, I think, part of what makes us essentially American. The fast food, junk food approach to movies and other entertainment. What could be more American than that? So, unfortunately, a movie like Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life from 2010 would have no place in our modern movie world. Hell, even Brad Pitt couldn't save it for us. But maybe that's the point. This is a film that at times seems like it came from another time, and another world. One where all of the rules of the summer blockbuster and the indie sleeper hit are thrown out the window. One where you have to go on instinct as a film goer. One where you either take it or leave it as is. The film plays by it's own rules.
  First of all, Sean Penn plays an architect of some renown, who still has issues with his dad after all these years. We then go back to the past, namely 1950's Waco, Texas. Brad Pitt is the dad, and he is strict and hard edged. He loves his three sons (Sean Penn is supposed to be the oldest) but is a stern taskmaster who reaps what he does not sow. Jessica Chastain is his sweet-natured wife, and also a loving mother who tends to put up in silence with her husband's strictness. The oldest son seethes with resentment at his father, and this drives much of the film. He plays with his little brother and their friends, in scenes which reminded me a bit of Stand By Me. All that childhood innocence and stuff. He also learns some important life lessons along the way.
  Second of all, the film kicks off into 2001: A Space Odyssey-like scenes which depict the birth of the cosmos, the beginning of life on earth, and the extinction of the dinosaurs. Although visually stunning, with some of the same visual effects used in 2001, it's hard to find just what is the connecting tissue between these scenes and the 1950's Waco scenes. But we haven't seen a film in ages that looks quite like this one. All of Malick's films have that deep brooding poetry of luscious visuals that often make the story and people in it seem non-existent. But this one tops them all, I believe. This movie is sometimes just too much. And maybe, on some wavelength we don't understand yet, it's just enough.
  Also, I personally liked the use of classical music in this film. This is something that can often be applied wrongly or badly in a film, and often for satirical effect. But Malick seems like he carefully chose the pieces which pop up in this film, something which reminds me of my personal favorite director, Stanley Kubrick. I'm 50 percent on the film's side just for that. I especially liked the use of Smetana's The Moldau in a scene which shows the kids playing. This scenario just should not work on paper. But when you put it up there on the big screen, it works beautifully. And I found the use of excerpts from the Berlioz Requiem to be inspired, especially when everyone meets on the shores of that sweet by and by. I don't think I could ever listen to that music again without thinking of this film. For me, that's a monumental success.
  To call this film ""arty"" is about as redundant as calling the sun hot. This film is so ""arty"" it makes Ingmar Bergman look like Judd Apatow. Not an easy thing to do. But a great movie is a great movie, regardless of whether it is ""highbrow"" or ""lowbrow"". This film has to be accepted and taken for what it is. Once done, the more ""open-minded"" movie viewers out there can take it in and appreciate it, and maybe even like it. I know you're out there somewhere! However, I don't think this film's esteem is going to grow or shrink in the next couple of decades. It will remain the same. And people will either respond rapturously to it, or long for the next Avengers movie. So be it. As long as we have Terrence Malick, or whoever the next generation inspired by him is, making films even close to this, we have hope. That's the other 50 percent.----------PEACE",1525996800,5,one thing that true movi america american movi goer film watch habit mani year american love crap entertainmentwis never get enough super hero movi lame chick flick clicheridden horror movi prequel sequel remak reboot etc almost tend run scream anyth aspir art film today also tend act angrili toward think part make u essenti american fast food junk food approach movi entertain could american unfortun movi like terrenc malick tree life 2010 would place modern movi world hell even brad pitt couldnt save u mayb that point film time seem like came anoth time anoth world one rule summer blockbust indi sleeper hit thrown window one go instinct film goer one either take leav film play rule first sean penn play architect renown still issu dad year go back past name 1950 waco texa brad pitt dad strict hard edg love three son sean penn suppos oldest stern taskmast reap sow jessica chastain sweetnatur wife also love mother tend put silenc husband strict

46195,580,4770,"The worst Mission: Impossible movie rife with cliches and overacting.

Mission: Impossible 2 is a lackluster sequel to Mission: Impossible. John Woo did his best job to up the ante to no avail as Woo's direction pales in comparison to Brian DePalma's original film. Mission: Impossible 2 completely fails to capture the genre of the first movie's spy thriller, opting instead for a lame action movie.

The occasional cool shot is offset by hilariously over-exaggerated close-ups and goofy zoom in shots. The cinematography can be really intense, but constant quick cuts at the most inappropriate times with campy slow motion sequences take you completely out of the movie.

Script-wise, Mission: Impossible 2 is nowhere near as clever or original as the debut feature. There are few if any interesting twists with none of the political spy intrigue or intelligence. The narrative is as cookie cutter cliche as can be for an action movie. The plot is muddled while also being filled with plot holes. For example, when we see a character infected with a virus for 20 hours walking around fine, when the audience saw earlier in the film a person infected with the same disease visibly bed ridden once exposed for the same time.

Mission: Impossible 2 notably takes a distinctly more languid pace than its predecessor. It is a slow paced bore compared to the stealth espionage vibe from the first film. You initially get high tension scenes with great stakes where anything can happen, which turns into meaningless explosions with no suspense in this sequel.

For an action movie, there is little action until the ridiculously overdone finale that ruins any suspension of disbelief you might have had left. M:I 2 opens with a thrilling and genuinely impressive feat of strength from Tom Cruise wherein he is hanging off a cliff with his hands. It looks as cool as anything in an action film. It immediately establishes how strong and skilled Cruise's Ethan Hunt character is, but then the rest of the movie goes into explosions and back flips that remove you from the film experience. It is too bad they could not do better than the opening sequences that seriously thrill.

Next, the score from Hans Zimmer is not nearly as cool or iconic as Danny Elfman's entry from Mission: Impossible. Initially a mesmerizing soundtrack that keeps you engaged, devolves into Zimmer playing up a highly ill fitting score into each scene. Many of the musical cues do not match the tone of the scene. Tense scenes will suddenly launch into odd parades attempting epic stature, but feel so out of place. Likewise, tender moments will go from romantic to laughable in seconds thanks to the score. Elfman just did a nicer job composing Mission: Impossible when you juxtapose the music Zimmer composed for Mission: Impossible 2. Zimmer did not accompany this movie's atmosphere appropriately.

Finally, I must mention the acting. While the first film takes it time laying out intense scenes of excellent acting, M:I 2 reverts into cheesy one-liners and bland exposition. The poor basic writing is part of the problem, but this cast plays their parts with such dull enthusiasm. Tom Cruise is the only saving grace. He clearly is trying to convey emotion while jumping from serious and thoughtful to distraught emotionally. Cruise as Ethan Hunt is the glue that holds this franchise together. Thandie Newton is terrible as the love interest thief to Cruise's eccentric Hunt character. She is so deadpan that you never believe her emotional scenes. Her delivery is pretty horrible honestly. Ving Rhames is fun as always as the Gucci and Versace loving hacker partner to Hunt. The Australian comedy relief is rather forgettable and makes for a poor replacement to Jean Reno's hilarious character from Mission: Impossible. The villains are all poorly cast and never threatening. They essentially act like evil Ethan Hunt caricatures. What a waste of the excellent actors Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson.",1525996800,2,worst mission imposs movi rife clich overact mission imposs 2 lacklust sequel mission imposs john woo best job ant avail woo direct pale comparison brian depalma origin film mission imposs 2 complet fail captur genr first movi spi thriller opt instead lame action movi occasion cool shot offset hilari overexagger closeup goofi zoom shot cinematographi realli intens constant quick cut inappropri time campi slow motion sequenc take complet movi scriptwis mission imposs 2 nowher near clever origin debut featur interest twist none polit spi intrigu intellig narr cooki cutter clich action movi plot muddl also fill plot hole exampl see charact infect viru 20 hour walk around fine audienc saw earlier film person infect diseas visibl bed ridden expo time mission imposs 2 notabl take distinctli languid pace predecessor slow pace bore compar stealth espionag vibe first film initi get high tension scene great stake anyth happen turn meaningless explos suspens sequel action movi littl action ridicul overdon final ruin suspens disbelief might left mi 2 open thrill genuin impress feat strength tom cruis wherein

46257,580,4735,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Conversation is a masterclass in brilliant directing. The cinematography is gorgeous and crafty. The acting is so real and subtle. The use of sound is actually genius. The music sets the tone. It's just very slow paced that holds back the excellent story and writing.

Around every corner is a beautiful shot. The scenes are set up so well with unique set pieces and wholly originally locales from empty hotel rooms to a surveillance device convention to a business executive's office. It's all fascinating to look at with every moment.

Gene Hackman delivers the most reserved and calm performance of his career as private investigator Harry Caul. You are constantly wondering what he is thinking. He is relatable in how human the character comes across as with every choice. He is cautious to the point of being paranoid, but he is also amiable around others if quiet. He loves jazz and listening to those around him. Hackman puts on a true display of complex acting with very little dialogue or movement. He's the perfect private investigator in The Conversation.

A young Harrison Ford delivers a highly believable and threatening performance like no other in his career. Another stand out is Hackman's assistant listener Stan played by the funny and quirky John Cazale. Allen Garfield's amazingly underhanded as the Hackman's rival investigator Bernie. Overall, the entire ensemble delivers excellent acting for their respective roles.

The Conversation can boast the most creative use of sound and voice recordings in any movie ever. The use of audio recordings and playback are played with by Coppola going in and out of conversations. Coppola utilizes the technology at his disposal for unique moments of listening in and spying on people. The subtle changes in volume and clarity are intentional and superbly executed. I am fascinated at how Coppola managed to pull of such a clever use of audio to enhance the movie watching experience. Audiences will be confused then enlightened in minutes as you solve the mystery along side Hackman's character.

The music is beautiful piano from composer David Shire. There are long passages of delight piano melodies to liven up the mood, then long stretches of disquieting silence. The suspense is palpable as loud rushes of piano rhythms will soar into hearing with haunting sounds that generate a worrisome atmosphere to The Conversation. The score is excellent and quite memorable too. It really contributes to the suspenseful vibe that The Conversation contains.

The writing and story is a tale of privacy, investigation, wiretapping, ethics, morality, and faith. Coppola's writing is realistic and quite deep. His topics still feel relevant and profound. He makes Hackman's Harry Caul character a man that must listen in and follow people, taping their lives, and risking their lives just for money. This wears heavy on Hackman's mind as he believes himself a man of faith. It is an intriguing take on ethical questions brought up during the course of an investigator's career. You will wonder whether bugging people is worth it too after watching The Conversation.",1525996800,4,franci ford coppola convers masterclass brilliant direct cinematographi gorgeou crafti act real subtl use sound actual geniu music set tone slow pace hold back excel stori write around everi corner beauti shot scene set well uniqu set piec wholli origin local empti hotel room surveil devic convent busi execut offic fascin look everi moment gene hackman deliv reserv calm perform career privat investig harri caul constantli wonder think relat human charact come across everi choic cautiou point paranoid also amiabl around other quiet love jazz listen around hackman put true display complex act littl dialogu movement he perfect privat investig convers young harrison ford deliv highli believ threaten perform like career anoth stand hackman assist listen stan play funni quirki john cazal allen garfield amazingli underhand hackman rival investig berni overal entir ensembl deliv excel act respect role convers boast creativ use sound voic record movi ever use audio record playback play coppola go convers coppola util technolog dispos uniqu moment listen spi peopl subtl chang volum clariti intent superbl

Some of the issues trace back to the fact that it was originally designed to be a sequence of TV movies.  Shortly after the theatrical version was released, the network opted in favor of a weekly series, so the writers were working overtime, with the production on many episodes being rushed.  The basic storyline was like a Biblical epic in its conception.  The political subtext was conservative, with strong Cold War sensibilities, and frequent religious symbolism.  The good: the series was visually impressive, and there were a few outstanding episodes.  The bad: the script writing was intermittent, at best.  Many scripts were mediocre, some were terrible.  Several potentially good ideas were ruined with bad dialog and ludicrous plot twists.  Despite this, one of the enduring strengths of the series was that the characters were easy to identify with.

46308,1978,550,"I admit that I didn't hate National Treasure. Sure, the plot looks like a parody of The Da Vinci Code, but then, maybe it *is* a parody of Dan Brown's bestselling novel? Or rather Brown's sources, since the two projects were near-contemporary. Other obvious sources of inspiration include the Indiana Jones flicks and Romancing the Stone.

Nicolas Cage stars a conspiracy theorist actually named Benjamin Franklin who steals the Declaration of Independence (!) to find secret codes revealing the location of the famed treasure of the Knights Templar. Then, the hunt is on, with our hero being chased by evil treasure-hunters, FBI agents and (perhaps) Templars.

46358,1732,2273,"NOTE:  As of May 13, 2018, THE LOST WORLD and RETURN TO THE LOST WORLD are available for free streaming as two separate movies via Amazon Prime.  Amazon also lists the same shows as a pay for view TV series.

I recently re-read Doyle's LOST WORLD, so with that fresh in mind I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime.  I was pleasantly surprised at how closely the early part of the movie adhered to the book.  However, as the movie unfolded there were changes that I don't understand.  Lord John Roxton, one of the more interesting characters in the book, is dropped completely.  Three characters are added, Jenny Nielson, Malu and Jim.  Nielson is a wealthy American wildlife photographer who is added to the expedition because she agreed to finance it.  I'm not sure why she was added to the movie.  I thought that perhaps she was there to add a romantic  interest but if that was the intent, those scenes must have ended on the cutting room floor.  Malu, in her sarong, is primarily decorative, though she learns languages with astonishing rapidity.  Jim, all thirteen years of him, stows away on the ship carrying the expedition to Africa for ""adventure"".  I suppose the adults kept him around to run errands intead of leaving him with authorities at the port of call.  The inclusion of none of these characters added appreciably to Arthur Conan Doyle's story.

Of course deleting and adding characters is child's play for these movie makers.  They moved the entire Lost World from South America to Africa.  They then filmed in Zimbabwe.  The African geography around the Lost World is peculiar.  The expedition goes up river to the river village of  Kalemie.  They then depart down river into ""unsettled regions"", to search for the Lost World.  I would have to see a map.  The script is a little silly in places.  For example, professor Summerlee falls into a hole.  Malone runs to the edge and asks him if he is there.  Our 10 year old yelled, ""Where else would he be?"". Not long after this and having seen some very poor dinosaur special effects, she left me to it.  Those first hand puppet dinosaurs the expedition met were plant eaters, ""completely harmless"" according to one of the professors. The daughter snorted as she left the room.  She has heard of cape buffalo, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and elephants.  She has also heard the story of my cousin being stomped by a cow.  At the end we learn that in the Lost World dinosaur taxology has but two classifications - good ones  and bad ones.  The classification being based entirely upon diet.  Though pterodactyls seem to be classed as good ones even though they are carnivores.

If you are looking for dinosaur mayhem, look in another movie.  In this one there is a lot of talk about dinosaurs but only a few glimpses of parts of dinosaurs.  I don't remember seeing a whole animal except for distance shots of flying pterodactyls and, of course, Percy who must have used up the whole special effects budget.

These actors, particularly John Rhys-Davies, deserved a better script in a better movie.  Still, for a low budget sci-fi movie made before JURASSIC PARK, it is better than average.",1526083200,3,note may 13 2018 lost world return lost world avail free stream two separ movi via amazon prime amazon also list show pay view tv seri recent reread doyl lost world fresh mind stream movi via amazon prime pleasantli surpris close earli part movi adher book howev movi unfold chang dont understand lord john roxton one interest charact book drop complet three charact ad jenni nielson malu jim nielson wealthi american wildlif photograph ad expedit agre financ im sure ad movi thought perhap add romant interest intent scene must end cut room floor malu sarong primarili decor though learn languag astonish rapid jim thirteen year stow away ship carri expedit africa adventur suppos adult kept around run errand intead leav author port call inclus none charact ad appreci arthur conan doyl stori cours delet ad charact child play movi maker move entir lost world south america africa film zimbabw african geographi around lost world peculiar expedit goe river river villag kalemi depart river unsettl region search lost world

Since I don't know the background of the boy, I can't say if there was anyway that he could have been helped. I'm sure that Lori's school mates and perhaps a teacher might have felt that she was having a tough time. Certainly her mother was willing to hear Lori say what she wanted to hear.

I'm not convinced that Lori's uncaring mother would not have tried to locate her after a couple of days, but there are many young people out there that are virtually on their own even when living with a parent. Lori's yearning to be loved and cared about enables her to glaze over what she saw at the river and try to find some happiness with a person unable to give any feeling to her.  The ending would have happened one way or another.

I can only hope that a movie like this can remind us to pay attention to the people around us and help if we can.",1526083200,4,usual like dark film one dark two young peopl deep problem sinc dont know background boy cant say anyway could help im sure lori school mate perhap teacher might felt tough time certainli mother will hear lori say want hear im convinc lori uncar mother would tri locat coupl day mani young peopl virtual even live parent lori yearn love care enabl glaze saw river tri find happi person unabl give feel end would happen one way anoth hope movi like remind u pay attent peopl around u help

The first traces the evolution of fish to amphibians, and notes that some early traits survive in mammals to this day.  An interesting aspect of this is the way in which genes determine how embryos develop limbs.  The second describes how early reptiles evolved mammal-like characteristics.  For a long time, mammals could not compete with more successful reptile species, but the extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago gave mammals a foothold.  The third examines how human traits such as color vision and bipedal walking developed from more primitive primates, and traces similarities between human and ancestral brains.

This film is 100% CGI, but is of very high quality, and not a distraction with fake-looking characters  and choppy movements, like other animated films out there. I particularly like the fact that this film has just the right balance between comedy and horror; it doesnt overindulge in any one area, so you won't be overly frightened or laughing hysterically. The animation is very believable, and the characters are interesting. Overall, Hotel Transylvania is a solid first installment in the film series.

Tommy Lee Jones, plays Sheriff Ed, out to get a serial murderer. He opens the film describing a young sociopath who killed a young girl. Anton Chigurth is a sociopath serial killer, using compressed air  attached to a hose that he puts on someones forehead, pulls the trigger and kills them. Josh Brolin plays Llewelyn Moss, a day worker trying to make a living and comes across a good drug deal gone bad and tracks a man who has 2 million dollars in a suitcase. The entire film revolves around these three characters, their significant others and the money.

Lots of high tension and stress, and one of the best films you will see. Good versus evil, and who is to win. That is for us to decide.

46439,102,3628,"RELEASED IN 2015 and written & directed by Guillermo del Toro, ""Crimson Peak is a Gothic drama/mystery/horror about a young woman (Mia Wasikowska) in the opening years of the 1900s who falls in love with a mysterious English man (Tom Hiddleston) and moves from Buffalo, NY, to a creepy English manor, where his weird older sister also lives (Jessica Chastain). Ghosts of the past make themselves known, ultimately leading to the truth.

Aside from Jane Eyre and House of Usher, both of which have been filmed several times, Crimson Peak has similarities to haunting Gothic flicks like Bram Stokers Dracula (1992), The Others (2001) and Mary Shelleys Frankenstein (1994), but its thankfully nowhere near as ridiculously melodramatic as the latter. The spectral horror is more low-key than Dracula and Frankenstein, which is why I cite The Others. Psychological Gothic horror like Demons of the Mind (1972) and The Eternal (1998) are other comparisons. If you're in the mood for a movie like these, youll probably appreciate Crimson Peak.

Honestly, this is one of the most sumptuously LOOKING movies Ive ever seen. Take, for instance, the numerous scenes of Edith (Mia) walking down the lavish halls in an alluring white nightgown and flowing blond hair. The Gothic lushness is to die for.

Some people think the story is meh, but its no better or worse than the plots of the seven movies listed above. Whilst the first act in Buffalo is somewhat tedious, the movie picks up interest once Edith (Mia) moves to the unsettling English chateau, which has seen better days. I read a critics list of a dozen questions in an attempt to tear the film to pieces, but I easily answered all of them, which showed that this critic was intentionally LOOKING FOR something to dislike. Every potential quibble is effortlessly explained by clues in the picture or simply reading in-between the lines.

46441,240,1783,"I have two big issues with this film:

1) Why make a remake of a film that isn't so old? They only waited 12 years between both first films (and the time lapse feels even less). If they had made this remake a 180 degree fully different retelling, maybe it would have been more interesting for me. However, they repeat a lot of the high school angst and bullying from the original film, but without the amazing chemistry offered by Tobey Macguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. It's the same issue I felt with the third X-Men film Apocalypse. They decide to reunite the original X-Men cast as teenagers and retell the same bullying with teen angst story instead of focusing on the far more interesting stories of Professor X, Magneto, Mystique and Moira. Had the original film been made in the mid 90's like Batman, the special effects and vibe would have felt fresh rather than too much of a carbon copy.

2) The movie is a mess. Okay, Christopher Nolan did a fabulous job doing an edgier retake of Batman. He strayed away from the comical Adam West tv series and the kitschy (but still a guilty pleasure) of the 1990's Michael Keaton films. I won't even mention the horrid George Clooney flick. However, there was this wholesomeness of Tobey's films that I will always enjoy. He's soecially awkward and feels guilty about his unwitting participation in his uncle's death. He chooses to make up for it by trying to be a decent superhero that takes lots of selfies to pay for his college education. This film wishes to create a more morally ambiguous Spiderman that doesn't seem all that iggered about Uncle Ben's demise. It just didn't sit well with me. I feel like this was only worsened because the original film is still too recent and in people's memories so they will be compared.

There are some decent scenes in the film, but the special effects, predictable plot and all-around vibe of the movie was a huge let down.

46465,6594,1013,"I rarely give a five-star review. The bench-mark here is extremely high  (Think: Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane, Platoon...). Yet, here it is: a 1982 comedy (and how many comedies rate 5 stars, say, after three decades?) but I have no problem here.

Hadn't seen this movie in 30 years. I laughed as much today (2018) as I did back in 82 when I saw with a theatre-full of people laughing their heads off. And it's STILL an outstanding piece of collaborative creativity.

This package: In addition to the movie, a series of ""making of"" features. ALSO outstanding. For some reason, the star and director were filmed while making the movie itself, offering an incredible glimpse of what it takes to make a classic movie. Hoffman's vintage screen tests--as much for his wardrobe and make-up as his performance--survived and are used here. Interviews shot 25 years after the fact. The result is sometimes as hilarious and poignant as the movie itself.

You want to know how a movie is made? Don't skip the ""bonus"" material. You'll have a new appreciation of what it takes (Hoffman, two writers and director/actor Sidney Pollack) to simply get a script that all believe can be a good movie: At least years of work, and once the cameras were rolling, it kept evolving, DAILY.

46474,580,3180,"The best Mission: Impossible film yet!

Brad Bird has absolutely reinvented what a Mission: Impossible movie is capable of with this latest installment into this decades long action franchise. Bird has directed Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol with a cool contemporary eye for gorgeous cinematography like the sandstorm overtaking Dubai to IMF agent Ethan Hunt vanishing into fog like a ghost. We are treated to a visual feast that will surely appease die hard fans of the M:I franchise and new viewers alike. Bird's direction is the very best the series has to offer with creative close-ups and sleek shots in every scene. His quick pacing and easy to enjoy narrative makes Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol the greatest film in the Mission: Impossible franchise to date. Brad Bird has surpassed the skillful directors preceding him in the Mission: Impossible canon including Brian DePalma, John Woo, and J.J. Abrams.

The audience is constantly engaged with new exotic locales from Moscow and Dubai to Mumbai and Seattle. Ghost Protocol is an entertaining tour of the world just like the previous M:I movies have been.

Yet, the stakes are even higher and the action is even more intense. Tom Cruise climbs the tallest building in the world for real, navigates through a sandstorm, and leaps from car to car in a high rise parking complex for a brutal finale. The combat is more visceral and well choreographed than any previous Mission: Impossible movie. Overall, Ghost Protocol gives you exhilarating action and constantly impressive stunts. All audiences will certainly enjoy the spectacle.

Another unique aspect to Ghost Protocol is the excellent writing. It is easily the most well written sequel in the series. The consistent quality of the humor leads to delightful quips and jokes that always land. Dialogue that is actually witty is what the Mission: Impossible movies have sorely missed. Gone are the days of corny one-liners and dated references in this franchise. You will laugh more than you expected on this absolute blast of a blockbuster.

The story is quite engaging and easy to follow. I appreciate Brad Bird's narrative focus being more on developing interesting characters than endlessly rehashing the political spy thriller cliches of the past films. We get a character study of Ethan Hunt and deeper emotional attachment to his team than ever before. We get the spy espionage with all the genre's usual twists and turns, while also developing Ethan Hunt's character into a significantly deeper man rather than the goofy perfect Hunt of old. There is a crazy villain as always, but the focal point remains of Hunt's character developing and leading his IMF squad. It is much more mature than the original trilogy of movies.

Michael Giacchino's music is a completely new arrangement for Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol. He tenderly accompanies the emotional moments with delicate care that are so sweet, you will think the score is on a new level. The most neat feature of Giacchino's score this time around is that there are multi-faceted layers to the soundtrack that sonically reference the various cultural areas that we see Ethan Hunt visit. When in The Kremlin, Russian themes match the moment, while in Dubai, similar fitting musical elements complement the scene. It is a score that is simultaneously rousing in suspense for the tense sequences as well as often delving into beautiful passages. I like Giacchino's compositions quite a bit for Ghost Protocol.

Acting-wist, Ghost Protocol ramps up the believable performances with this newest cast of characters. First of all, Tom Cruise is as thoroughly thrilling and entertaining as ever. Cruise continues to prove why he is still a massive box office draw and the biggest action icon alive. His combat is fierce. His delivery of dialogue is biting and earnest, while he always attracts your attention to his every movie. Cruise is cool.

Meanwhile, Simon Pegg is hilarious as Agent Benji, who is rife with lovable comedy relief. Paula Patton plays the awesome Agent Jane whose combat is as killer as Hunt's fights. Jeremy Renner doubled down on the comedy while also additionally providing backup gunfire on occasion. The various Russian actors are excellent and really fun foils and antagonists for Ethan Hunt to test his skills alongside. If you watch until the end, you will also be treated with some sweet cameos for fans of the franchise. Finally, the lovely La Seydoux kills it as the French assassin Sabine Moreau. She is certainly one of the best villains Hunt has had to contend with lately.

In all, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol is the pinnacle of modern day action movies. It remains my favorite film in the entire Mission: Impossible franchise. Brad Bird proves he can direct an action thriller with the best of them. Ghost Protocol revitalizes this series for even the most dejected and jaded action cinema movie goer.",1526169600,5,best mission imposs film yet brad bird absolut reinvent mission imposs movi capabl latest instal decad long action franchis bird direct mission imposs ghost protocol cool contemporari eye gorgeou cinematographi like sandstorm overtak dubai imf agent ethan hunt vanish fog like ghost treat visual feast sure appeas die hard fan mi franchis new viewer alik bird direct best seri offer creativ closeup sleek shot everi scene quick pace easi enjoy narr make mission imposs ghost protocol greatest film mission imposs franchis date brad bird surpass skill director preced mission imposs canon includ brian depalma john woo jj abram audienc constantli engag new exot local moscow dubai mumbai seattl ghost protocol entertain tour world like previou mi movi yet stake even higher action even intens tom cruis climb tallest build world real navig sandstorm leap car car high rise park complex brutal final combat viscer well choreograph previou mission imposs movi overal ghost protocol give exhilar action constantli impress stunt audienc certainli enjoy spectacl anoth uniqu aspect ghost protocol excel write easili well written sequel seri consist qualiti humor lead delight quip joke alway land dialogu actual witti

46485,4635,3577,"I first saw the original ""Poltergeist"" when it was showing on the big screen, and since back then I was at a more impressionable age, that film has had a special place in my heart ever since (that someone stole my wallet while I had my eyes fixed on the screen did not exactly add to the overall enjoyment but made my visit to the cinema unforgettable in its very own way).

That being said, I did not find the remake as bad as I had feared. While in my eyes it never reaches the class of the original, it has its moments, and I liked the little subplot about a young boy facing his fear and finding his courage. Comparing original version and remake, I also find it interesting and telling that the new script is about a family down on their luck rather than one for which moving house means moving up.

What I did miss is the special sense of producer Steven Spielberg's humor that added such a nice touch to the original version (and of course that one brought forth one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest symphonic scores), and I also missed moments that were really scary (I may be a bit jaded, though).

To cut things shirt: Whether you're a fan of the original version or not doesn't really make a difference - the remake is definitely not a must-see. On the other hand, I feel that there are quite a few remakes out there that are a greater waste of time than this one.

It's talky like a lot of indie films, and though a huge clue to the ending came in the form of a briefcase's contents, and a more obvious one later, it is a really good film.  The flash forwards aren't obvious that they weren't flash backs until the end, and the mixing of the two was a bit disorientating a few times, but overall well done.  Both actors gave convincing performances.  I was particularly enthralled by Jessica, and not just her beauty, but actual acting talent.  Jessica really gave her character believability.

Some say the both characters are suffering from depression.  Buddy/Nicolas (Richard Brundage) is obviously severely depressed.  Brittney/Daphne (Jessica Bohl) has some social issues and a bad breakup in high school, but did not seem depressed to me.  It was a bit confusing with the flash forwards throughout the movie that could lead you to conclude that she was depressed about choosing the life of an escort, but not when you consider the ending.  Obviously, the ending was more traumatic than she anticipated, but it appeared she was able to pull herself together and continue on with life.  I think chopping up what would have been a long scene of her grieving at the end would have been too much, and dribbling it out throughout the film was brilliant, though could have been a little better done by giving those clips a different color palette.  Still, if you weren't thinking that it had to do with her recounting of her life as an escort, the ending may have been more easily guessed and not as dramatic.

For an indie film, I thought this was an excellent film.  If I were an indie film fan, I probably would have given it 5 stars.  I can't say that I wasn't at least a little biased by Jessica Bohl's natural beauty, but even a more common looking, but equally talented actress, it is definitely a film worth seeing.",1526169600,4,big indi fan realli like film talki like lot indi film though huge clue end came form briefcas content obviou one later realli good film flash forward arent obviou werent flash back end mix two bit disorient time overal well done actor gave convinc perform particularli enthral jessica beauti actual act talent jessica realli gave charact believ say charact suffer depress buddynicola richard brundag obvious sever depress brittneydaphn jessica bohl social issu bad breakup high school seem depress bit confus flash forward throughout movi could lead conclud depress choos life escort consid end obvious end traumat anticip appear abl pull togeth continu life think chop would long scene griev end would much dribbl throughout film brilliant though could littl better done give clip differ color palett still werent think recount life escort end may easili guess dramat indi film thought excel film indi film fan probabl would

46527,102,3078,"RELEASED IN 2001 and written & directed by Alejandro Amenbar, ""The Others"" is a haunted house flick about a woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in an old manor on one of the Channel Islands with her two photosensitive children immediately after WWII. After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.

While this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and theres a one-dimensional pale look to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the perpetually fog-laden grounds create a nice ghostly ambiance.

Everything hinges on whether the last act effectively reveals the truth and it does. The film provides intriguing food for thought.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Cantabria, Spain (exteriors of the mansion); Penshurst, Kent, England (The Lime Walk) and Madrid.

The first half of the movie does feature some wooden acting and clunky dialogue. Then, it is if you really are there as these people warm up to each other - or should I say that one character begins to thaw from exposure to a warm, accepting, honest person. It is charming with a slow-pace. All this happens amidst gorgeous Utah. What a beautiful, beautiful state, going by what is shown here! The mansion where most of the action takes place seems grand and modest at the same time, if you pick up the Mormon vibe that permeates this film.

46555,2198,5216,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere, which makes this particular film all the more interesting, considering that even though it came out in 1991, it's the only Ghibli film to never be released in America with an English dub.....until now.

Taeko is a 27 year old woman, who's unmarried, has lived her whole life in Tokyo, and presently works at a company there. Wanting to get away from city life for a while, she decides to take a trip to visit the family of the elder brother of her brother-in-law in the rural countryside to help with the safflower harvest. But all throughout her trip, she begins to have flashbacks to herself as a schoolgirl in the fifth grade. Pretty soon, she's remembering all sorts of things from her past, like first crushes and the frustrations of puberty and growing up. And as the narrative shifts between the past and present, Taeko will begin to realize what she truly wants out of life.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Miyazaki film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible, and it makes scenes come alive in a very subtle way. The way that Taeko remembers her past is much like many of us do in real life, with flashbacks sometimes vivid enough that she can visualize her older self interacting with her younger self. Even the flashbacks are drawn and animated slightly differently, with scenes having a bit of a brighter, unfinished sort of haze over everything--the way our actual memories work when we try to think far back into our childhoods.

As for the plot, I can sort of understand why the film flew under the radar for so long, and why Disney was hesitant to dub it back when it was first released; mainly because this movie touches upon a genre not normally seen in animation---a realistic drama written for adults. As Taeko reflects on her past, some of her memories are more pleasant than others. Some are cute and funny, like her first crush, while others are more awkward, like when her classmates begin getting their first periods (and being bullied by the boys), and some are outright sad, like when she almost lands an important role in a play, but her father (for unknown reasons) refuses to let her perform.  It's a story that can really only be appreciated by an adult. As we reflect back on our childhoods, we see how we became the people we are today, and how some memories can be altered because of nostalgia glasses, or how some events can seem like a huge deal at the time, but aren't really important in the long run, or vice versa.

I once thought ""Whisper of the Heart"" was one of Ghibli's more realistic films, but this one has now taken that spot. Be warned that this film can be very slow moving at times, but a patient viewer will be rewarded with a lesson in how reflecting on your past can help you discover (or re-discover) what's truly important in life.",1526169600,4,anyon fan lover anim seen least one film studio ghibli acclaim writer director hayao miyazaki beauti stun movi known world inspir artist everywher make particular film interest consid even though came 1991 ghibli film never releas america english dubuntil taeko 27 year old woman who unmarri live whole life tokyo present work compani want get away citi life decid take trip visit famili elder brother brotherinlaw rural countrysid help safflow harvest throughout trip begin flashback schoolgirl fifth grade pretti soon she rememb sort thing past like first crush frustrat puberti grow narr shift past present taeko begin realiz truli want life visual anim per usual miyazaki film utterli breathtak look watch amount sheer detail put everi background charact movement incred make scene come aliv subtl way way taeko rememb past much like mani u real life flashback sometim vivid enough visual older self interact younger self even flashback drawn anim slightli differ scene bit brighter unfinish sort haze

46603,2323,5711,"Without a doubt, this is one of the most ridiculous films that I have ever sat through. It starts off reasonably enough but after about 30 minutes it gets so unbelievable that it is impossible to take seriously. Honestly, I don't know how a script like this could have ever been green lighted for production. The circumstances and situations are just so utterly beyond belief that its asking way too much of the audience to suspend their disbelief.

Samuel L Jackson's acting is pretty on par with most of his action movies. He plays a bumbling and inept President of the United States who ends up depending on a 13 year old to rescue him over and over again throughout the course of the movie. The ""bad guys"" seem equally inept at their jobs, letting the two slip through their fingers in scene after scene. The only character portrayed as being competent is the 13 year old who seems to be going through a bit of an identity crisis until he stumbles across the President of the United States and barely avoids being crashed into be Air Force One.

About the only appeal of this movie is that it doesn't feature a lot of gore or bad language. Therefore, it might be of appeal to kids as a sort of family film.

I highly recommend this particular combo pack if you want to watch every movie in the franchise.

It is a fantastic deal as far as I'm concerned. I got every single Mission: Impossible movie that is out on blu-ray with this bundle. It is a fairly reasonable price considering you are getting all 5 of the movies in the series for essentially the price of one.

As far as the quality of the movies in the series, they are all worth a watch for their high entertainment and replay value. Tom Cruise is the greatest action star of all time and this series proves why. The movies continue to get better as they go along. Mission: Impossible has replaced James Bond for spy movies and replaced every other action franchise for thrills.

46633,7138,2027,"So this fantastic final chapter of the Indiana Jones trilogy centers around Indy and his companions including his father Henry Jones played by Sean Connery as they search to find the Holy Grail. What's not to like about this movie? It's got James Bond, Indy kicking Nazi ass again, and a huge quest to find the Cup of Christ, it's awesome! If you ask anybody which Indiana Jones movie is the best they will either say Raiders or Crusade but most will say Crusade, and I can't disagree. Our story starts with young Indiana Jones when he recovers an ancient cross from some bandits in the desert. Our story then flashes forward only one year after Raiders Of The Lost Ark when he hears news that his father is missing, so he travels to Venice to try and figure out where his father is. He soon meets up with his father's assistant Elsa who takes him to the library where he was last scene, and through a series of clues they discover not the whereabouts of his father but a crypt containing one of the Knights of the First Crusade. Engraved on the Knight's shield is a clue to find the Grail. Very soon after they meet a secret order that protects the Grail and discover his father has been taken by the Nazis and taken to Munich. So they get to Munich they rescue his father and now the chase is on to discover one of the greatest artifacts in human history. It's got lots of action, very good comedy, intriguing history of the Grail and is just good fun and has a fantastic ending. Go buy these movies. Watch them. Love them.

46649,5083,1796,"This is a dumb movie...

There are few movies as counter-intuitively wrong and inaccurate, or as self-confident as this one. The ideals of socialism are supposedly represented here, but in fact they are counterfeit and at root fascist. This movie seems impossibly unreal because it IS impossibly unreal in what it points to ""in horror"". Unrealistic and impossible, not because totalitarian states aren't bad (they are), but because totalitarian states NEVER embody socialism, they only embody a parody of socialism and the total control of fascism. I think that people just started saying Orwell was a genius in America and the UK one day back in the 80's of shoulder pads and fantasy hairspray dos and before you know it, everybody was saying it, but it was never true of this book and certainly not of the movie. This is bad filmmaking from a bad story written by a man who was off kilter and severely out of touch with the fascism that had long taken hold of his own country.

True totalitarianism is horrific enough in itself without dragging into it and vilifying all of the finer, if apparently difficult, bits of Buddhist philosophy, socialism and the modernist art that you can't fathom. If you want to see the REAL dangers of faux communism, watch The Blue Kite, which depicts a historical nightmare that does follow a realistic, predictable timeline and the story of which this story is a pale and flat rip-off, even with John Hurt's stoic use of the role. The momentary poetic fragments, such as the two naked lovers watching a peasant washer woman down below singing gently to herself, are unfortunately not indicative of the rest of the movie which attempts to startle us constantly and never manages to do so.

Orwell would have done better to rail against modernity itself, rather than to paint scenarios about post-war England that are simply not possible. Orwell was afraid of movements appealing to socialism, but he was too blinded by English fascism to see that he was furthering exactly that kind of agenda, but pitting an impossibly stark and totalitarian English-accented ""socialism"" against the beautifully pre-modern.",1526256000,1,dumb movi movi counterintuit wrong inaccur selfconfid one ideal social supposedli repres fact counterfeit root fascist movi seem imposs unreal imposs unreal point horror unrealist imposs totalitarian state arent bad totalitarian state never embodi social embodi parodi social total control fascism think peopl start say orwel geniu america uk one day back 80 shoulder pad fantasi hairspray do know everybodi say never true book certainli movi bad filmmak bad stori written man kilter sever touch fascism long taken hold countri true totalitarian horrif enough without drag vilifi finer appar difficult bit buddhist philosophi social modernist art cant fathom want see real danger faux commun watch blue kite depict histor nightmar follow realist predict timelin stori stori pale flat ripoff even john hurt stoic use role momentari poetic fragment two nake lover watch peasant washer woman sing gentli unfortun indic rest movi attempt startl u constantli never manag orwel would done

It's one of the greatest movies ever made, it ushered in a new cultural phenomenon that has lasted to this very day, and it's groundbreaking special effects have paved the way for modern technology to flourish. There is too much to say about Star Wars, but we will focus today on the original 1977 version, no special edition version because Han does not shoot first, among other things. So Star Wars, if you've been living under a rock for almost 40 years is an epic sci-fi saga set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away centering around the journey of Luke Skywalker becoming a Jedi. We'll get to the story of the prequel movies soon. So why is this movie above all others my favorite movie of all time? Well it being the first movie I ever saw makes a huge impact, and it making me the happy geek I am today makes a huge difference. I shudder to think who the hell I would be if I never saw Star Wars at the age of 2 or 3. I am the biggest Star Wars fan you will ever meet. No seriously I can quote this whole movie from beginning to end...with sound effects and music included! I have seen it that many times! I love it so much, I have such a huge passion for it even after all these years, it's unbelievable. I love the story, it's concepts, it's ideas, it's technology, it's planets, everything! The characters are unforgettable, we have Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker who has this very simple life but is thrust into action led by a wise mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi played masterfully by Sir Alec Guiness,on their travels they meet a smuggler Han Solo played by Harrison Ford and his copilot Chewbacca played by Peter Mayhew, and are accompanied by two robots C-3PO played by Anthony Daniels and R2-D2 played by Kenny Baker who have to go save Princess Leia played by Carrie Fisher from the evil Galactic Empire headed by Darth Vader played epic-ally by both David Prowse and James Earl Jones and the sinister Grand Moff Tarkin played beyond perfection by the incredible Peter Cushing. Seriously it is because of Darth Vader that I always wanted the villain to win in every movie when I was a kid, because the villains were way more interesting than the heroes, and made me the evil Sith Lord I am today. I could write a 300 page essay on Star Wars, but I will try and keep this short. The dialogue is so quotable, I think almost 100% of what I said when I was a little kid was a quote from Star Wars. The music is perfect, this is John Williams best score ever and it still gives me goosebumps and almost brings tears to my eyes. It's very difficult to describe the appeal of Star Wars for me,it's really just something you will have to experience for yourself if you haven't seen it already. And if you have seen it before, what are you doing reading this? Go watch Star Wars!

Well it stars Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson as two people who are kinda going through a rough patch in their life, and they meet each other in Tokyo and a friendship grows between them. It doesn't sound like the plot to a perfect movie, but you have to see it! I love everything about it. I love the setting, I am a sucker for Japan, I absolutely adore it and it looks so beautiful in this movie. I love the characters, Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are phenomenal in this movie, their dialogue feels real and genuine, they have fantastic chemistry together and I have never seen a bond like theirs in any movie. The music, I need to own this soundtrack. It's just too damn good! I have seen this movie several times, I can't find one thing wrong with it. Even these two annoying and quite frankly idiotic characters who I despise, they don't take away from the movie. They are there for a reason, which is to make us sympathize and love our main characters even more. You are with them all the way and you just love watching them. It feels like you are on this little journey with them, just hanging out in Tokyo and having a blast. I do not ever want this movie to end, and it breaks my heart when it does, cause I love every minute of it. Now I am going to make this clear, Lost In Translation is not my favorite movie of all time, that title belongs to Star Wars. But even I can't say that Star Wars is a perfect movie, but this is, at least to me it is. I mean I could go on forever about how this movie is amazing, but I am going to let you judge that for yourself. I don't care if you buy it, rent it, I don't care how you see it, just see it. It is worth your time and it is only barely over an hour and a half long, so it's not too long even though I wish it was like three hours long.",1526256000,5,lost translat perfect movi cannot find one thing wrong even tri nit picki could perfect movi possibl well star bill murray scarlett johansson two peopl kinda go rough patch life meet tokyo friendship grow doesnt sound like plot perfect movi see love everyth love set sucker japan absolut ador look beauti movi love charact bill murray scarlett johansson phenomen movi dialogu feel real genuin fantast chemistri togeth never seen bond like movi music need soundtrack damn good seen movi sever time cant find one thing wrong even two annoy quit frankli idiot charact despis dont take away movi reason make u sympath love main charact even way love watch feel like littl journey hang tokyo blast ever want movi end break heart caus love everi minut go make clear lost translat favorit movi time titl belong star
46681,102,1818,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Gary Shore, ""Dracula Untold tells the origin of Dracula: In the 15th century Prince Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) must protect his small kingdom of Wallachia (in modern-day Romania) from a Turk warlord (Dominic Cooper) who demands a thousand boys from Wallachia & Transylvania, including Vlads son. Threatened by the unsurmountable Turk army, Vlad desperately makes a dubious pact with a formidable caged vampire in order to acquire its dark powers and save his family & kingdom. Sarah Gadon plays Vlads winsome wife.

The producers flirted with the idea of Dracula Untold being part of Universals Dark Universe; and the epilogue of the movie, set in the modern world, suggests this, insinuating a franchise. This idea was dropped, however, and The Mummy (2017) became the first official film in the Dark Universe. In any case, Dracula Untold was fairly successful at the Box Office, making $56.3 million in North America and $217.1 million worldwide against a cost of $70 million.

My title blurb pretty much tells you all you need to know: Dracula Untold is basically the dark Superman of 15th century Eastern Europe where Dracula wields the power to defeat a thousand-man army. If you like the great prologue to Coppolas Bram Stokers Dracula (1992), youll probably like this movie, which gives several nods to that forerunner.

The film LOOKS awesome and has a fine cast. But unlike Bram Stokers Dracula, its rapidly paced and doesnt leave much room to breathe; so the characterizations aren't quite deep enough. Its good, but somehow hollow and forgettable. Bram Stokers Dracula was perhaps a little too slow while Dracula Untold is too hurried. I wish the creators found the happy medium between the two because, with just a little bit more time and attention to detail, it couldve been great.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot entirely in Northern Ireland. WRITERS: Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.

46725,2056,4822,"(Moderate Spoilers) ""Norma Rae"" (Sally Field) makes some bad choices (she particularly isn't choosy with her boyfriends) and is barely making ends meet (living with her folks), but she's smarter than she looks and more perceptive than she lets on, knowing full well that the conditions and low wages are less than satisfactory at the local mill in her small town.  Enter corporation unionizer ""Reuben"" (Ron Leibman), who discovers this in Norma Rae, thereby setting the wheels in motion for Norma Rae making her indelible impact, though it's a gritty fight and not pretty (you almost feel like you're sweating right along with the characters).  Will she win over her coworkers and convince them that it's time for a change?  There is a noticeable miscasting of Norma Rae's Mom, ""Leona,"" played by an otherwise fine Barbara Baxley because, in my opinion, that role should have gone to the tertiary character of mill worker ""Linette,"" played by Grace Zabriskie (who played another factory worker as Debra Winger's Mom in ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" just to name one of many memorable future roles by Zabriskie).  And the ending leaves something to be desired regarding Norma Rae's work status, but borrowing a phrase from Norma Rae herself when new hubby ""Sonny"" (Beau Bridges) asks her about her and Reuben's relationship, she says that it's totally innocent but that he's ""still in her head.""

46727,7138,2793,"So this installment of the Star Wars saga takes place ten years after The Phantom Menace, and surprisingly....not much has happened. Anakin has gotten older, he's still a Padawan. Obi-Wan is now almost a Jedi master. Padme is no longer a queen and yet everyone still calls her milady for some reason, and she hasn't aged at all she looks the same as she did from the last movie. The Republic has encountered a bit of a problem, a separatist organization has been created and now the Republic is almost on the verge of war. And the separatists have tried to assassinate Padme, so she has to be guarded by Obi-Wan and Anakin, whose relationship has certainly changed in the past ten years. They are good friends but they still have the master-apprentice relationship, which cause friction as Anakin is acting very self absorbed and feels like his master is holding him back. So they figure out a bounty hunter was sent to kill Padme so they have to split up, Obi-Wan starts his search for the mysterious bounty hunter, and Anakin has to protect Padme and return her to her home planet of Naboo. Soon Obi-Wan discovers who the bounty hunter is and travels to the world of Kamino where he also discovers that a clone army has been produced for the Republic from the DNA of the bounty hunter Jango Fett the father of Boba Fett. Meanwhile on Naboo a romance starts to blossom between Anakin and Padme and really I could care less. I know it's important to the characters and the story but really it's just tedious and boring. It reminds me of Bella and Edward's romance in Twilight, and that makes me sick to my stomach, but we will get to the Twilight movies in good time! So anyway, Obi-Wan tracks Jango to the planet of Geonosis and gets captured and has a brief chat with Count Dooku played masterfully by Christopher Lee who is the saving grace of this movie! Seriously, what is with these prequel movies and the only thing I truly love about them is the secondary Sith Lord? Speaking of Sith Lords, Count Dooku reveals to Obi-Wan that the senate of the Republic is under control of a Sith Lord by the name of Darth Sidious. Yes, yes, politicians are evil. Ha ha! Moving on...Anakin has horrible visions of his mother dying so he goes to Tatooine to try and find her, but finds it's too late and she dies in his arms. They soon receive a pre-recorded message form Obi-Wan telling them of the planet Geonosis, so they travel there to save him only to be captured themselves. Meanwhile in the senate, emergency powers are given to Chancellor Palpatine to use the clone army to fight the separatists. So they quickly rush over to Geonosis to capture their leaders and save our heroes. The battle is successful but Dooku gets away so our Jedi knights track him down and fight him. The fights in this movie are really good! Even though the duel with Dooku is short, it's still very good primarily for one reason, we get to see Yoda pull out his lightsaber and fight! Are you kidding me? And he's like lightning quick, he's doing all these flips and tricks, it's unbelievable! I'd say watch the movie just for that! But the fight doesn't go good for our heroes, Anakin gets his right arm cut off, him and Obi-Wan are nearly crushed by a pillar which Yoda stops but gives enough time for Dooku to escape the planet. So Anakin gets a robot arm and even secretly marries Padme even though they've known each other for a couple of days, maybe a week at best. Seriously, they meet up after ten years, travel to Naboo, hang out and build their horribly written romance for a few days, go to Tatooine and bury Anakin's mother and then go to Geonosis to help Obi-Wan and then they are sooo deeply in love they get married. Blah, blah blah, yadda, yadda, yadda. Just wake me up when we see Yoda fight.",1526256000,2,instal star war saga take place ten year phantom menac surprisinglynot much happen anakin gotten older he still padawan obiwan almost jedi master padm longer queen yet everyon still call miladi reason hasnt age look last movi republ encount bit problem separatist organ creat republ almost verg war separatist tri assassin padm guard obiwan anakin whose relationship certainli chang past ten year good friend still masterapprentic relationship caus friction anakin act self absorb feel like master hold back figur bounti hunter sent kill padm split obiwan start search mysteri bounti hunter anakin protect padm return home planet naboo soon obiwan discov bounti hunter travel world kamino also discov clone armi produc republ dna bounti hunter jango fett father boba fett meanwhil naboo romanc start blossom anakin padm realli could care le know import charact stori realli tediou bore remind bella edward romanc twilight make sick stomach get twilight movi

First off, these players have zero paranormal investigative experience, and second off the bickering between the players is absolutely annoying.  Some of the things caught on film are startling, but because it seems like none of these players are ever on the same page, the moment is ruined.  The end of day video ""confessionals"" are always interesting because you get an insight into the players, but once they're back together it's back to bickering and accusing.  The end of night 5 with the giggling Lina (???)... that was pretty weird.  Not sure if it was scary, but it was it was something.

46751,3349,4412,"ONLY buy the DUB3 'Comic Book Collector's Edition' version. It is a pressed disk NOT burned like the others I tried.

There's probably a half dozen versions of this movie sold on Amazon. I tried many of them in order to get a decent copy.

Finally, I discovered the Comic Book 'Collector's Edition' version.  It is on a pressed disc and should last just about forever.  It looks like the authoring was done on a Mac as opposed to a DVD recorder.  This version includes chapter settings and a theatrical trailer.  Very good picture and sound.

Seeing this film over and over again, year after year, I find it never grows over-familiar. It plays like a favorite musical album; the more I know it, the more I like it. The cinematography has not aged at all. The dialogue is so spare and cynical it has not grown old-fashioned. Much of the emotional effect of ' Voyage to the Planet of the Prehistoric Women'  is achieved by indirection; as we leave the theater, we are absolutely convinced that the only thing keeping the world from going crazy is knowing we have seen 'THE MOVIE'.

Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well. The technical difficulties are so daunting that its a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion. I found myself convinced by both story and saga.

46753,7138,202,"So Return Of The Jedi is set a few months after the events of the last movie. The Empire has constructed a new Death Star much more powerful than the first, Luke has finished his Jedi training, and Han Solo is still trapped in carbonite. So first things first, Luke has to go rescue his friend from the clutches of the grotesque Jabba The Hutt on his home planet Tatooine. Now a few things to cover before we carry on with the story, now in past movies we keep hearing about this Jabba The Hutt and that he's bad news, but they don't really tell you what he looks like so you're mind is thinking of all kinds of things of how he looks and he's pretty gross basically a giant slug. Just, eck! Second, Luke Skywalker is a Jedi now. He is so different from when we saw him in The Empire Strikes Back, he's no longer whining about his training, he has complete faith in himself and his abilities, and he has mastered the Force because before he like really had to concentrate to use the Force, now it's instantaneous! Oh, and he's got a brand new cool lightsaber! So back to the story, they save Han and Luke debarks back to the Dagobah system one last time to finish his training. And sadly, master Yoda is dying of old age and reveals to Luke several things, he has to confront Vader to truly become a Jedi, after Yoda dies Luke is the only Jedi left in the galaxy, and there is another member of the Skywalker family. And yes, I do get misty-eyed when Yoda dies, it's depressing. Meanwhile on the second Death Star, The Emperor himself, Darth Vader's master arrives to corrupt young Skywalker to the dark side. And The Emperor is just magnificent played to sinister perfection by Ian McDiarmid. If Darth Vader made me love villains, The Emperor makes me want to be them more than anything. Soon the Rebels learn of the new Death Star and have to of course, take it out. But there's a hitch, it has a shield surrounding it and the only way to deactivate the shield is to destroy the shield generator before their fleet arrives to begin their assault on the Death Star. And this is where our Rebel friends meet the Ewoks, and this is either the second most hated life form in Star Wars history next to Jar Jar Binks, or is the most cute and adorable thing ever introduced into Star Wars. I am shocked at how divided people are to these little teddy bear looking things, I thought they were cute and harmless even though they make a mockery of my beloved Empire. So anyway, Luke confronts Vader on Endor and Vader takes him to The Emperor. So now we have a three way battle in this film, the fight to take out the shield generator, the fight to take out the Death Star, and the fight to defeat Darth Vader and The Emperor. And all the fights are really well done, but of course the final duel between Luke and Vader is the showstopper, there is so much emotion in this fight, more so than I think in any Star Wars movie. True, the duel between Luke and Vader in Cloud City is the best of the original trilogy, but this has serious emotions charging this fight, I mean there is a point where Luke just snaps. He is coming at Vader with all of his resolve and all of his anger, and this is not one of those carefully choreographed fight scenes you see in the prequels, Luke is swinging his lightsaber like a bat just hitting everything and really catching Vader off guard to the point where he cuts Vader's right hand off to reveal he has a robot hand just like Luke. So he defeats Darth Vader and The Emperor is just taunting Luke to kill him and Luke just won't do that. So he throws his lightsaber down, saying he will never turn to the dark side and he is a Jedi like his father before him. So The Emperor decides if he will not join us he will die, and then he proceeds to shoot lightning out of his fingers!! The Jedi can go screw themselves for all I care, this was the final moment that made me fully embrace the Empire and the dark side! I'd love to see the Jedi try that. So The Emperor is just torturing Luke, surging his body with electricity as he is begging Darth Vader to save him, and this is a great moment. You see the camera zoom in on Darth Vader's face and you can tell he's really conflicted and he still has the mask on and everything. So he looks to Luke and back to his master, picks The Emperor up over his head and throws him over a railing into the reactor where he disintegrates. Meanwhile the Rebels destroy the shield generator and they send in the fighters to destroy the Death Star, so Luke has to get out of there and he takes Darth Vader with him, and he asks Luke to take his mask off because he is dying and he wants to see his son with his own eyes. I'm sorry! I spoiled the surprise, but it's very difficult to talk about this movie without giving that away! So Luke obeys his father and slowly takes his mask off to reveal the scarred face of Anakin Skywalker, who tells Luke he saved him and to leave him, but Luke refuses and watches his father die and escapes the Death Star before it is blown up. At the celebration on Endor, Luke creates a funeral pyre for his father and burns his body.

46800,157,1925,"If you're buying this one because you want to watch everything Freddie Highmore is in because you loved him on Bates Motel or The Good Doctor, be aware he doesn't actually appear in the movie until the hour and three minute mark, even though the DVD uses his image to promote this 2010 film on the cover. The opening credits sort of tell us this will happen with the actors names on various supermarket products and the one with his name on it has ""and with 10% Freddie Highmore"". He plays the older version of the main character Nigel, the majority of the movie Nigel is played by Oscar Kennedy, who is also still currently appearing in plenty of TV shows, but none which have had the impact of Bates Motel or The Good Doctor on mainstream audience numbers. The younger actor has more of a meaty role than Highmore does, having to cope with the death of his mother early on in the film, an abusive father who blames him for anything going wrong in the household, a psychopathic cleaning lady trying to seduce his father for his money I guess, as he doesn't seem to have anything personality or looks wise to offer, and primary school life.  The movie just jumps a number of years into the future with Highmore sitting at the kitchen table and being referred to as Nigel by the father.  Not sure why they didn't stick with Kennedy since he'd carried the film up to then, we know Highmore can act, but he isn't really given anything to do here.  The most he has to do is put his hand up to be enrolled in home economics instead of metal work or something when his classmates and teacher look on in shock wanting to know if he's joking.  The movie is set in 1960's Britain, where I guess this wasn't what anyone did.  The movie also doesn't fill in the gaps, Nigel had friends and seemed somewhat popular at school, but the Highmore version suddenly has no friends.  His dad doesn't seem to hate him so much either.

Overall the movie doesn't explain why if the cleaning lady is known throughout the town as a great cook, she is a cleaning lady and not being hired by at least a diner or take away restaurant if not a better restaurant or has started her own business?  Obviously Nigel's dad would believe she's a great cook since his previous wife just put unopened cans into boiling water and would never touch anything fresh, but other character's in the story refer to her as a great cook too. Spoilers follow - Even when Nigel starts to cook she see this as a threat, knowing that's all she has to offer and probably thinking she'll be dumped by his father if Nigel can now meet her food  level expertise.  You guess early on what her plan is when she first starts the cleaning gig, but why take so long to carry it out?  Nerves?  Why not embrace Nigel's desire to cook so she can frame him later?

For me there wasn't enough happening in the movie to rate it any higher and the unanswered questions also keep that rating low.  Although I've loved Highmore in Bates, Good Doctor and other stuff, there didn't seem to be any point to him replacing the other actor near the end of the film, and him suddenly being in it doesn't add anything to the film because he doesn't do much other than carry home various food dishes he cooked at the school. I actually thought the less known Oscar Kennedy does a much better acting job in this one.",1526342400,3,your buy one want watch everyth freddi highmor love bate motel good doctor awar doesnt actual appear movi hour three minut mark even though dvd use imag promot 2010 film cover open credit sort tell u happen actor name variou supermarket product one name 10 freddi highmor play older version main charact nigel major movi nigel play oscar kennedi also still current appear plenti tv show none impact bate motel good doctor mainstream audienc number younger actor meati role highmor cope death mother earli film abus father blame anyth go wrong household psychopath clean ladi tri seduc father money guess doesnt seem anyth person look wise offer primari school life movi jump number year futur highmor sit kitchen tabl refer nigel father sure didnt stick kennedi sinc hed carri film know highmor act isnt realli given anyth put hand enrol home econom instead metal work someth classmat teacher look shock want

My granny was cool. Most often, she'd take me to horror movies (at my request.) One of them was Circus of Horrors.

From as far back as I can remember, I've loved horror movies. For some reason, Circus of Horrors has stood out in my mind all this time. I'm so happy I came across it on Amazon. Watching it has brought back some nice memories.

Others have detailed the plot, so I won't rehash it here. I don't consider Circus of Horrors to be a schlock horror movie. Okay, so maybe it's a little schlocky. It's quite reminiscent of the old American International/Hammer/William Castle/Roger Corman films. But it has great production values and Anton Diffring at his creepy best. I only wish Donald Pleasence could have stuck around longer.

And ah, yes...the song: Reach for a Star. DJs would make a big deal over it being FROM CIRCUS OF HORRORS! I rather like it. And it isn't played that much in the movie. When it is, I think it offers quite a contrast to the grisly murders that are taking place.

46850,102,1207,"RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by the Hughes brothers, ""From Hell"" details the Jack the Ripper slayings in the slummy Whitechapel district of London in autumn, 1888. Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted detective while Robbie Coltrane appears as his colleague. Heather Graham is on hand as a prostitute that captures the Detectives interest.

The film was based on Alan Moores graphic novel of the same name. Moore condemned the change of his ""gruff"" version of Frederick Abberline with an ""absinthe-swilling dandy, referring to the protagonist played by Depp. In real life, theres no evidence that Abberline chased the dragon or that he had psychic visions. Speaking of real life, Moores graphic novel was based in large part on the royal conspiracy theory popularized in Stephen Knight's 1976 book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. This is one of several theories on the identity of the slayer. True or (probably) not, it makes for a good story.

From Hell plays like a Hammer film, but with a blockbuster budget in the modern era. A couple of comparable Hammer flicks are Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) and Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970). From Hell even shares a minor subplot with the latter (high society gentlemen in the Victorian era secretly partaking of taboo hedonistic pleasures). Like Hammers Gothic horror catalog, you can expect top hats & black coats, cobblestone streets, alluring women, a ghastly killer (or monster) and lush colors.

THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 2 minutes and was shot in Prague, Czech Republic, and England (Boscastle & Goldings).

My granny was cool. Most often, she'd take me to horror movies (at my request.) One of them was Circus of Horrors.

From as far back as I can remember, I've loved horror movies. For some reason, Circus of Horrors has stood out in my mind all this time. I'm so happy I came across it on Amazon. Watching it has brought back some nice memories.

Others have detailed the plot, so I won't rehash it here. I don't consider Circus of Horrors to be a schlock horror movie. Okay, so maybe it's a little schlocky. It's quite reminiscent of the old American International/Hammer/William Castle/Roger Corman films. But it has great production values and Anton Diffring at his creepy best. I only wish Donald Pleasence could have stuck around longer.

46995,265,2526,"This oddity stars a lot of before-they-were-stars and aims high with a low budget to deliver a dumb but fun romp full of cheap jump scares. Enjoy.

Alabama, 1863A gang of bank robbers with little trust among them spend the night in an abandoned plantation estate. As soon as they wade through the corn fields to ensure the house is truly vacant, they encounter (and shoot) a strange, eyeless and relatively hairless monster that they pass off as some sort of animal. Shortly thereafter one of their men disappears and another has visions of a horrifying little boy in the house. So, clearly their threat is supernatural and intelligent. Naturally, they say in the house.

The plot sounds overly basicand a lot like Feast (2005) or Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight (1995)but ends up delivering something more like a haunting than a creature feature. I actually only watched this when I learned it was one of Michael Shannons (The Shape of Water, Bug) early films. Then I noticed more familiar faces.

The cast includes Isaiah Washington (Ghost Ship), Nicki Aycox (Joy Ride 2, Jeepers Creepers II), Patrick Fugit (Gone Girl), Henry Thomas (Geralds Game, Fire in the Sky, Ouija: Origin of Evil) and Mark Boone Junior (30 Days of Night, Halloween II, Vampires).

Despite its low budget, this film is ambitious with its special effects. The opening scene depicts a rather gory bank robbery complete with blowing someones head clean off, and we see our monster up closeboth in the first 15 minutes. The gunshot and slashing wounds are almost entirely CGI (much like The Walking Dead), but at least its all on-screen. I appreciate the effort and feel it looks more than good enough to entertain.

Director (Alex Turner; Red Sands) and writer Simon Barrett (Youre Next, Blair Witch, The Guest) truly succeed on delivering a fun popcorn horror night full of jump scares (although cheap, they're fun if you know what you're getting into) and a variety of special effects. Admittedly, this $1.5 million direct-to-DVD films scares may not compare to the jumpy fun or scare-ticipation of Lights Out (2016), but it does a solid job of mixing things up. I was especially surprised (and pleasantly so, given the low budget) with the scene of the monster emerging from the womans stomachand I was so glad they went with practical effects. Additionally, however hokey, I enjoyed the scarecrow decapitation scene towards the end.

This film has earned a small cult following. You know what? I think its deserving. It aims high and features a broad cast of before-they-were-stars.

One may be annoyed that nothing about the haunting, the monsters or their form are explained. But whatever. Its dumb and fun.",1526428800,3,odditi star lot beforetheywerestar aim high low budget deliv dumb fun romp full cheap jump scare enjoy alabama 1863a gang bank robber littl trust among spend night abandon plantat estat soon wade corn field ensur hous truli vacant encount shoot strang eyeless rel hairless monster pas sort anim shortli thereaft one men disappear anoth vision horrifi littl boy hous clearli threat supernatur intellig natur say hous plot sound overli basicand lot like feast 2005 tale crypt demon knight 1995but end deliv someth like haunt creatur featur actual watch learn one michael shannon shape water bug earli film notic familiar face cast includ isaiah washington ghost ship nicki aycox joy ride 2 jeeper creeper ii patrick fugit gone girl henri thoma gerald game fire sky ouija origin evil mark boon junior 30 day night halloween ii vampir despit low budget film ambiti special effect open scene depict rather gori bank robberi complet blow someon head clean see monster closeboth first 15 minut gunshot slash wound almost entir cgi much like walk dead least onscreen appreci effort feel look good enough entertain director alex turner red sand writer simon barrett your next blair

The weird promo at the beginning of the DVD had me thinking I'd been given the wrong DVD or someone had hacked it and put the wrong movie filled with an infomercial. 1-900-976-JUICE was the number. It threw me off. I thought it was real.

Seeing four people destroy themselves thru mindless drugs did not do much for me. In and of themselves these characters are not that interesting. I also find their descent into destruction to be atypical of the average drug user. I've known many drug users and only one of them ended up stealing from their parents and later ending up in rehab. This film shows the worst possible fate that can occur to one in every single situation. Amputation, institutionalization, incarceration and prostitution. I find that unrealistic and a major flaw in the film.

I have decided to remove this from my DVD shelf. While an interesting independent film, I felt it lacked enough understanding and concentrated too much on the graphic nature of addiction. But perhaps that was the whole point. Three and a Half Stars (Rounded Down). Buy it and you may or may not like it. I'm the 1559th person to review this film on Amazon.

47025,5567,4389,"When I set this DVD up in my DVD player I thought there had been some kind of mistake. The weird promo at the beginning of the DVD had me thinking I'd been given the wrong DVD or someone had hacked it and put the wrong movie filled with an infomercial. 1-900-976-JUICE was the number. It threw me off. I thought it was real.

Seeing four people destroy themselves thru mindless drugs did not do much for me. In and of themselves these characters are not that interesting. I also find their descent into destruction to be atypical of the average drug user. I've known many drug users and only one of them ended up stealing from their parents and later ending up in rehab. This film shows the worst possible fate that can occur to one in every single situation. Amputation, institutionalization, incarceration and prostitution. I find that unrealistic and a major flaw in the film.

I have decided to remove this from my DVD shelf. While an interesting independent film, I felt it lacked enough understanding and concentrated too much on the graphic nature of addiction. But perhaps that was the whole point. Three and a Half Stars (Rounded Down). Buy it and you may or may not like it. I'm the 1559th person to review this film on Amazon.

Keats fine poetry notwithstanding and Abbie Cornish being a fine actress whom I enjoy but just was hard to watch her so cloistered in this film even though she was the only one who gave it spark and carried the interest in the film at all (though the little girl sister was very cute and enjoyed her as well). The countryside and scenery was lovely as were many of the sets. Just not my 'cup of tea' ..., the boring restrictions and proprieties of the late 1800 England.
