There are some glaring errors (why is the trunk of the Saab incredibly hot but the hood is cool, why doesn't the Beach Patrol SUV have a radio, why did the one chick think it was okay to lie on her boyfriend's stomach where all the acid was, where is there any beach in California that is deserted 24/7, etc.) but it works. Could it have been a better movie? Yes, definitely.

47109,5180,2709,This series really brings me back to my younger days when it used to air weekly on sci fi channel.  The protagonist of the story finds himself on the adventure of a life time and meets a lot of strange aliens and attempts to find his niche in this group.  It has some good humor and some great adventure and sticks to the classic style of sci fi of exploring ideas and meeting strange life.  If you are young may not be used to this brand of entertainment as sci fi is not the same anymore and tends to be about pushing sjw ideology with maybe a slight dash of pretentious entertainment.  This throws the pretentiousness out the window and attempts to immerse you in a bizarre universe that is willing to take risks.  Some risks seem to fall flat but others really take off and you get to see the characters evolve.  Some episodes may even seem to go slowly but there is this weird thing called character development that people don't seem to be used to anymore.,1526515200,5,seri realli bring back younger day use air weekli sci fi channel protagonist stori find adventur life time meet lot strang alien attempt find nich group good humor great adventur stick classic style sci fi explor idea meet strang life young may use brand entertain sci fi anymor tend push sjw ideolog mayb slight dash pretenti entertain throw pretenti window attempt immers bizarr univers will take risk risk seem fall flat other realli take get see charact evolv episod may even seem go slowli weird thing call charact develop peopl dont seem use anymor

47219,2262,2264,"Chick flicks and science fiction should be on opposite ends of the entertainment spectrum and should never be allowed to approach one another, much less merge into a bastard hybrid...and this film proves my point.

Don't be fooled, ""Another Earth"" is a ponderously, even torturously slow chick flick about a promising teenage astronomy student who destroys an innocent family by her stupid decision to drive drunk.  Her identity concealed (because she's legally a minor at the time of the car crash), she is incarcerated for four years and comes out a humbled soul whose dreams are so dashed that she seeks only the most menial labor as a school janitor.

Desperately needing to apologize, she seeks out the man whose pregnant wife and 5-year-old son were killed in the car crash that she caused.  Yet, when she sees that the widowed husband is even more emotionally damaged than she is, the young woman can't bring herself to confess her guilt.

So, instead, she becomes his housekeeper...and they fall in love.  But there is persistent tension throughout the film because you KNOW the cruel truth cannot remain hidden: ""I love you.  And, by the way, I'm the one who killed your wife and son.""

Yes, THAT is the main plot of this film...It's a tragic-romance chick flick.  So, you may be scratching your head and wondering where the ""science fiction"" comes into play.  Well you may ask.

As a badly-conceived subplot, a duplicate Earth is suddenly discovered not only within our solar system, but nearly in the same orbit as our Earth.  Same planet, same oceans, same continents, same climate, same cities and same human population with the same exact level of civilization.  It's a parallel-reality Earth, in fact, a mirror image world just a stone's throw away (but nobody ever noticed it before).

What. The. Hell...does all of this have to do with the chick-flick plot?

Well, at the very beginning of the film, the sensational discovery of this doppelganger Earth causes our promising teenage astronomy student to celebrate a little too heavily, which precipitates her car wreck.

After that, the parallel-Earth subplot recedes far into the background, such that we only occasionally hear about it through televised news reports.  So, the miraculous existence of a duplicate Earth becomes nothing more than an increasingly-stupid McGuffin for the rest of the film.

Science-fiction, space-fantasy and parallel-universe fans will wince and groan at the preposterous ""science"" that is sparingly offered, not to mention the laughable visual effects.  The other Earth, for example, is depicted as dominating our skies (easily 50X the size of a full moon), so close to us that it would cause cataclysmic gravitational effects on our planet as well as theirs.  This also suggests that the identical moons of the identical planets have overlapping orbits, adding their combined gravitational forces to the disastrous equation.

But, no, there are no mega-earthquakes or super-volcano eruptions or tsunamis, and our planet's atmosphere is not affected in the least...the monstrous duplicate Earth in our sky is just a piece of eye candy for mildly-curious spectators (and gullible audiences).

When the science-fiction subplot directly collides again with the chick-flick main plot (at the very end), writer/director Mike Cahill goes for a perplexing surprise ending.  In the process, however, he creates an enormous plothole: If the widowed husband (from our Earth) is reunited with his wife and family (who survived on the other Earth), then WTF happened to the OTHER husband on the other Earth?  Either there are two pissed-off identical husbands on the other planet, or somebody got some 'splainin' to do.

The cinematography is very good, as is the acting; but the snailpace of the poorly-conceived story and its plodding heartstring-tugging soundtrack are punishing.

47229,5437,5573,"I love this show.  It has beautiful settings beautifully photographed, interesting stories, interesting characters and fine acting all around.  I love it for the same reasons I love Midsomer Murders.  Being from America, I find the accents, the mannerisms, the surroundings--everything--so quaint and different and overwhelmingly attractive.  I also love Julia McKenzie in this role.  It's difficult to replace an established character, but she has done it marvelously.  I like her every bit as much as Geraldine McEwan, and perhaps even more.  There is something so attractive about her, I find it a pleasure just to look at her.  A kindness, a shyness coupled with a gentle assertiveness--it's perfect for this character.  It makes her able to blend very comfortably into all the scenarios in which she finds herself--always on the periphery, quietly in the background, receiving minimal notice, but taking everything in, shrewdly observing--I love the way she engages in apparent innocent conversation with the other characters, and gently guides the conversation to find out things, or merely gets them to open up and reveal confidences to her.  She makes this seem natural and believable.

This is a purely entertaining series without any overt displays of political correctness which infects so much of everything these days.  I'm too old to be inculcated any more, and find shows attempting to do it totally boring, for it's most often done at the expense of entertainment.

47279,2262,4622,"Here's ANOTHER slow, convoluted and dull Mike Cahill film that attempts to hybridize tragic chick-flick romance, science fiction and metaphysical claptrap, with predictable results.

In a nutshell, a ""scientist"" with a grudge against spirituality and creationism endeavors to prove his theory of eyeball evolution, but instead proves to himself that reincarnation is real.

Actually, that synopsis sounds ten times better than the movie itself.

While this film's contrived technobabble may at first appeal to atheist viewers (who enjoy mocking intelligent design and deriding those who endorse it), the fact remains that the pseudoscientific premise is flawed.

See, the ""scientist"" is manipulating genes so as to CREATE hybridized chimeras that support his evolution hypothesis.  In other words, the scientist is playing God in his laboratory and is only proving that mutations result from intelligent design (the scientist's intelligent design), rather than from chaotic evolution.

Judging from a few of the reviews for this movie, this glaring contradiction leaves a bad taste in the mouths of atheist viewers (and rightly so, because atheists aren't very receptive to or tolerant of glaring contradictions in their own narrow view of existence).

The contradiction is, in fact, pointed out to the scientist himself early in the film by his true-love interest, a sort of mysterious metaphysical chick with distinctive iris pigmentation and a belief in reincarnation.

Unfortunately, she is killed in a ridiculous elevator accident, leaving the scientist devastated...but not TOO devastated, because he hooks up with his lab assistant soon after the tragedy.  Still, he continues to grieve the loss of his first love for the rest of the movie.

Seven years later, the scientist and his wife (former lab assistant) have a baby; and, while adding the child's iris-scan to a medical database, they are puzzled to learn that the baby's iris-scan is already on record, belonging to an elderly fellow who died months earlier.  This development brings them in contact with another scientist who is researching a link between duplicate iris-scans and reincarnation.

Using the iris-scan database, a link is subsequently established between the deceased metaphysical girl (remember her?) and a 7-year-old child who currently resides in India, and......

Yes, you are correct, the plot has spiralled completely out of control at this point.

These weaker-than-weak twists and turns (and there are plenty of them) are NOT deep and they're NOT clever and they're NOT thought-provoking.  Rather, they play out on the screen like a desperate and futile attempt to lash together fragments of bad ideas into a story where there really is no story.",1526601600,1,here anoth slow convolut dull mike cahil film attempt hybrid tragic chickflick romanc scienc fiction metaphys claptrap predict result nutshel scientist grudg spiritu creation endeavor prove theori eyebal evolut instead prove reincarn real actual synopsi sound ten time better movi film contriv technobabbl may first appeal atheist viewer enjoy mock intellig design derid endors fact remain pseudoscientif premis flaw see scientist manipul gene creat hybrid chimera support evolut hypothesi word scientist play god laboratori prove mutat result intellig design scientist intellig design rather chaotic evolut judg review movi glare contradict leav bad tast mouth atheist viewer rightli atheist arent recept toler glare contradict narrow view exist contradict fact point scientist earli film truelov interest sort mysteri metaphys chick distinct iri pigment belief reincarn unfortun kill ridicul elev accid leav scientist devastatedbut devast hook lab assist soon tragedi still continu griev loss first love rest movi seven year later scientist wife former lab assist babi ad child irisscan medic databas puzzl learn babi irisscan

47283,580,2883,"The beautiful sentiment behind The Outsiders will move any audience. Your heart will break when you hear the character Johnny utter ""Stay gold, Ponyboy."" That line alone has stayed with me my entire life. The Outsiders will change your life forever in a way only a truly great film can.

Francis Ford Coppola directs yet another masterpiece of cinema with his 1983 coming of age classic film The Outsiders. I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it as a kid. It not only holds up, but I appreciate it more each time I watch it. It is a realistic testimony to childhood, poverty, gang life, friendship, and family. Coppola crafts each scene with a tender care and understanding for these characters. The result is every single scene is iconic. Coppola can claim he elevated the novel The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton to new heights as this is likely the greatest adaptation of a book ever.

The Outsiders is a landmark movie for its star cast, clever cinematography, apt framing, exhilarating soundtrack, gorgeous score, emotional story, and emotive acting. Every teenager needs to watch The Outsiders. I guarantee they will relate to someone in the movie.

Now, the director Coppola must be commended for his inventive camera work in The Outsiders. Whether someone is running across a field and the camera pans along with them or gentle still shot lingers on an emotional moment, Coppola always frames every shot to perfection. Practically every second of The Outsiders can be taken out of context as immortalized as one of the most iconic pictures in cinema history. The whole movie is gorgeous. I absolutely love the scene with the sunset shining on Ponyboy and Johnny's faces while they appreciate nature. Their silhouettes and monologues are burned lovingly into my memory. Some of Coppola's finest directing is woven into the thoughtful blanket of empathy that is The Outsiders. You must see this film!

The Outsiders features perhaps the most well cast collection of actors ever assembled. The entire ensemble delivers acts their hearts out. C. Thomas Howell gives the greatest performance of his life as Ponyboy Curtis. He is the movie character I relate to the most out of anyone. He feels so real. Howell acts rather resolute to hide his pain while revealing his emotions through his expressive eyes and face. I wish Howell's acting career was longer.

Likewise, Ralph Macchio lays down the most emotive performance from a child actor in memory as the lovable Johnny. Matt Dillon is perfect as the rough mug Dallas that wishes life were different as you start out hating him, then you feel sympathy for his character by the end. I remember Dillon most fondly for this film.

The Outsiders contains my favorite Patrick Swayze role ever as well. Swayze nails Ponyboy's stern oldest brother Darrel. He is tough, but clearly wishes the best for his youngest brother. Swayze is astoundingly cool and sympathetic here. Rob Lowe is so sweet as Ponyboy's middle brother Sodapop. He is as likable as I recall and gives a brilliant monologue at the end.

Additionally, The Outsiders boasts a fun performance from Emilio Estevez as Two-Bit Matthews. He is a blast to watch as Estevez eats up the scenery every time he is on screen. The Outsiders is also notable as one of Tom Cruise's first roles on film. He is already charismatic here. Cruise's future was already in motion as you are drawn to him when he is present. Diane Lane similarly engages the viewer deeply in one of her earliest roles too.

Musically, the score is one of cinema's most beautiful. Carmine Coppola composed the most gorgeous theme for The Outsiders. The rest of the soundtrack is a series of old rockabilly tunes and surf rock selections that dazzle and thrill you. There is always something nice to listen to while you watch The Outsiders.

In all, The Outsiders remains one of my favorite films. It is a must see movie for all teenagers and adults. Francis Ford Coppola bestowed us with another amazing adaptation of a novel like his Godfather Trilogy. I highly recommend The Outsiders.

47299,1386,460,"""And Then There Were None"" is a 2015 BBC adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1939 novel of the same name. It originally aired in three parts for a total running time of 3 hours. This is a dreary, flat, and unattractive adaptation by screenwriter Sarah Phelps and director Craig Viverios. It begins with a heavy, ominous score and grey, drab visuals before anything has happened, out of line with the mood of the characters at that point. The score and visuals are sullen throughout, leaving no opportunity for any change in mood once someone dies, or the characters realize that they are being hunted, or as they begin to fear one another out of desperation. These people must be terrified, yet the film can build no suspense.

Eight guests of Mr. and Mrs. Owen travel to Soldier Island, invited under different pretexts: Vera Claythorne (Maeve Dermody), a schoolteacher, has taken employment as Mrs. Owen's secretary for the summer. Justice Lawrence Wargrave (Charles Dance) expects to meet a friend. Young Tony Marston (Douglas Booth) thinks there is a party. General John McArthur (Sam Neill) is to be interviewed by Mr. Owen, a military historian. Philip Lombard (Aiden Turner) is a soldier of fortune hired to ""handle situations"". Religious spinster Emily Brent (Miranda Richardson) expects Mrs. Owen to contribute to ""the education of girls of the lower order"". Dr. Edward Armstrong (Toby Stevens) has been asked to care for Mrs. Owen. ""Davis"" (Burn Gorman) is not who is says he is.

The guests are attended by Mrs. Ethel (Anna Maxwell Martin) and Mr. Thomas Rogers (Noah Taylor), the housekeeper and butler. In each bedroom, there is posted a copy of the nursery rhyme ""Ten Little Indians."" After dinner the first evening, a voice from the gramophone accuses each guest of being guilty of murder. Shortly thereafter, they begin to die, one by one.

Ethel and Thomas Rogers are overacted to the point of the grotesque. Some histories have been changed from the book to make the ""murders"" of which the guests are accused less ambiguous and more brutal. In the book, the accused were beyond the reach of criminal law, guilty of wrongdoing that resulted in someone dying but not literally of murder, leaving the reader in a moral quandary. Once the General dies, I found the culprit to be obvious. I read the book long ago, but I recall thinking that it was not possible to guess the identity of the murderer from the clues provided. Of course, the characters do foolish things to advance the story, like go off alone with a killer on the loose. But this adaptation never manages to evoke any mood except gloomy.",1526601600,3,none 2015 bbc adapt agatha christi 1939 novel name origin air three part total run time 3 hour dreari flat unattract adapt screenwrit sarah phelp director craig viverio begin heavi omin score grey drab visual anyth happen line mood charact point score visual sullen throughout leav opportun chang mood someon die charact realiz hunt begin fear one anoth desper peopl must terrifi yet film build suspens eight guest mr mr owen travel soldier island invit differ pretext vera claythorn maev dermodi schoolteach taken employ mr owen secretari summer justic lawrenc wargrav charl danc expect meet friend young toni marston dougla booth think parti gener john mcarthur sam neill interview mr owen militari historian philip lombard aiden turner soldier fortun hire handl situat religi spinster emili brent miranda richardson expect mr owen contribut educ girl lower order dr edward armstrong tobi steven ask care mr owen davi burn gorman say guest attend mr ethel anna maxwel martin mr thoma roger noah taylor housekeep butler bedroom post copi nurseri rhyme ten littl indian dinner first even voic gramophon accus guest guilti

47303,2349,4434,"Fairy Tail... Figured I give this show a try.... But ya this show isn't very impressive. Don't get me wrong, the blu ray quality is fantastic with that 5.1 audio too, not being in a stupid 4x3 screen size either since this series isn't that old.

 So we we have these people who are in this amazing strong guild called the fairy tail, filled with the strongest wizards around. I thought they were going to be a group of badasses, turns out most of them are a group of drunks. Fairy Tail tries to have series moments but it throws humor so much that I can't really take this show seriously even on the supposedly sad moments in the show. It's like if in the final fight with naruto and sasuke all they were doing for every 5 minutes is make a joke, it just kills the momentum. It doesn't have any badass serious moments like one piece or naruto than can masterfully handle its slapstick humor masterfully while telling a serious tale. Fairy Tail is like one piece in a way that it doesn't have any proper arks, just small side adventures and on to the next adventure. I guess the only plot going around here is the main characters gradually getting stronger as the series progresses so they can kick more but as they go. The blond chick who joins fairy tail at the start of the series is particularly usless. You think having a title like celestial wizard sounds pretty cool, but turns out her spirits are far from it. She just overall feels like she gets in the way of the actual wizards.

But hey this is only the first collection. I haven even started to get into the meat of the series, or it's movies and OVA's.

I do think it's a buy but at your own risk. People have different tastes in anime and I say if you don't enjoy that typical anime comedy then your probably not going to enjoy it as much as someone who does. Hopefully the rest of the series picks up momentum in it's tone. Less jokes, more action please.",1526601600,4,fairi tail figur give show tri ya show isnt impress dont get wrong blu ray qualiti fantast 51 audio stupid 4x3 screen size either sinc seri isnt old peopl amaz strong guild call fairi tail fill strongest wizard around thought go group badass turn group drunk fairi tail tri seri moment throw humor much cant realli take show serious even supposedli sad moment show like final fight naruto sasuk everi 5 minut make joke kill momentum doesnt badass seriou moment like one piec naruto master handl slapstick humor master tell seriou tale fairi tail like one piec way doesnt proper ark small side adventur next adventur guess plot go around main charact gradual get stronger seri progress kick go blond chick join fairi tail start seri particularli usless think titl like celesti wizard sound pretti cool turn spirit far overal feel like get way actual wizard hey first collect even start get meat seri movi

Then we are introduced to just about everybody's back story right up front. There is funny people, creepy people, and a variety of other characters. It makes you want to kick somebody and get this thing started!

We get some turbulence; is this it? Is the plane going to go down before we even get started? No wait there is more. The creepiest character gets dispatched any most graphic way.

I understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid $2 more for M-Disc, a burnable disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.  The video and audio quality is excellent on the disc.

These are great murder mysteries. If you like Sherlock Holmes you will love these movies also. Many of them featured dogs in a prominent way. The dogs at humor at appropriate moments. I wish Hollywood still knew how to make these kinds of great movies.
In one of the movies you will see the dog Toto from The Wizard of Oz fame.

At the same time, though, the performances by the talented actors and actresses in the film make it all feel mostly worthwhile. 'Age of Ultron' gets sadly settled with a gigantic number of plot points that it both needs to carry on from previous movies as well as set down to establish for future releases. What it does excel at, though, are the fascinating moments where Paul Bettany, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader, and others get to reflect on why they do what what they do.

The guys at RedLetterMedia put it well when they stated that the movie came off like a gigantic double-cheeseburger from a middling restaurant.

In this movie we really get to see the Avengers together in action scenes throughout the entire movie. Something that hasn't been done yet in other films. We seen them working together in creative ways which I think is really cool.

This movie also really sets the tone for so many movies to follow as it shows the fears and misgivings that will slowly break the team apart. You see Thor and Hulk going their own ways. You see Tony Stark worrying so much about protecting the world and he ignores the potential dangers. Hawkeye gets his best character arc to date.

I don't know why so many people complain about the quality, Viz did a GREAT job restoring 1992 animation! Not only is it more sharp and crisp, it is also brighter, and there is more of the image that fits on the screen. This release is also apparently the first English Uncut release for the series, so you get episodes that were never released before, and new lines and scenes.

The box for this set is wonderful, and the artwork on it is perfect. The included booklet has a handy episode and character guide, as well as art of the tv series. The box has small holographic details on the corners, and Usagi's transformation broach on the back. It has a light shimmer, and is perfect for showcasing the series.

People need to stop being so picky, they should actually be grateful to Viz for this release. The voice acting fits everyone perfectly for their personality, and many of the voices are a definite upgrade to the originals. This is the perfect release that the series deserved from the start.

47561,2860,5400,"I loved the film, having recently stumbled on it. This is a micro-budget, independent film, but the two leads are both credible in their roles as naive, but conflicted, young Mormon missionaries. RJ is a bit awkward, adding to the realism and charm.

RJ is an innocent and idealistic young man, a product of his strict upbringing. While he has known that he has gay leanings, his church has taught him that ""same sex attraction"" is a choice, and a sin. He sincerely believed his mission would turn him into a spiritual powerhouse. And that it would make him straight.

As RJ begins his mission with a more experienced companion, Chris, he soon learns that sharing the gospel is not as easy as it seems. Few people are interested in it. The days are long and boring, knocking on doors. Chris keeps his cool, showing RJ the ropes, until an ""investigator"" verbally ambushes the young men with inconsistencies about church history.

At that point, Chris has a change of heart. He suddenly begins to experience a great deal of doubt and confusion. Then the pair are physically accosted by a couple of drunken rednecks.

As the missionary companions confront a hostile world together, and an emotional bond develops. The slowly growing attraction seems natural, and makes this movie captivating.

The young men struggle against their desires, but they eventually consummate their relationship. They abandon all pretense of being on a mission, and enjoy each other's company until they are caught a few weeks later.

RJ is sent home, where he nobly informs his parents and the church leadership that he is gay, and not ashamed of it. Chris remains to finish the few remaining months of his mission due to his father's influence. The lovers are in touch by snail mail.

The ending was left deliberately ambiguous, but hopeful, as funding for a second film was uncertain. Fortunately, we get to see the lovers in two more films.
Some of the story line was a stretch. Chris was an experienced missionary by the time he confronted the investigator who accused Joseph Smith, founder of the church, of being a pedophile. By that point in his mission, he must have encountered dozens, or hundreds, of people with negative views of the church. It doesn't seem plausible that the incident would have had such an effect on him.

It didn't seem plausible that the two would just stop doing their missionary work after starting a sexual relationship without talking about it. It didn't seem realistic that they would start smoking pot with an investigator.

RJ would have been formally excommunicated, I am fairly sure, although the church view has been evolving in recent years. You can be gay. as long as you are celibate.

Despite plot holes, and occasional stilted dialogue, Ferrucci and Farmer are extremely convincing as two young men in love. Their chemistry is amazing, and the music score adds to the effect. This is a haunting and poignant tale of forbidden first love.

47571,2320,5662,"A Burstyn diamond, good story, a historical period piece of depth and dignity. Having endured tragedy in my own young life, the story was very easy to relate to in terms of all the characters. The film drops in deep and slow allowing all the actors, including the incredible young ones, especially the one who played Lou, plenty of time to flesh out their moments,.There is also lots of action. A wishing well, a wishing you well, a good solid drama with lots of subtexts, downright homespun wisdom that deals with issues still active in our times. It made me a bit nostalgic for a childhood in which I could be outside running around doing whatever without adult supervision, safely playing in the woods. The scenery was beautiful.

Takashi Miike's entire filmography is pretty much composed of ultra-violent, over the top films, and this one is one of his best known films for a reason. The scenes of gore will make anyone cringe. The violence is very imaginative, you have to give it that. There were scenes of violence and torture so shocking, even I was taken aback and couldn't resist cringing.

47588,2118,781,"Father Brown Set One, 1974 film

Gilbert Keith Chesterton wrote fifty-one short stories in the early twentieth century. Father Ignatius Brown is a parish priest and also an amateur detective whose observations and psychological insights are used to unravel mysteries. Chesterton was a master of paradox (truth standing on its head to attract attention) with his witty stories. He was inspired by a remark about priests, where auricular confessions can reveal many crimes to a parish priest who learns about the sins of people. Fr. Brown is a most unlikely detective compared to other detectives of fiction (Sherlock Holmes, Philip Marlowe, Hercule Poirot, etc.). These stories are taken from the five volumes of short stories.

Disk 1.
1) The Hammer of God. A Colonel is brutally murdered in a manner where there are no likely suspects. Fr. Brown solves the crime.
2) The Oracle of the Dog. After he decides to change his will a Colonel is killed. The family dog helps Fr. Brown to identify the murderer.
3) The Curse of the Golden Cross. When an archeologist is threatened, who did it? Fr. Brown uses his knowledge of medieval history to solve the mystery.
4) The Eye of Apollo. A woman suffers from following the leader of a pagan cult. Fr. Brown investigates.

Disk 2.
5) The Three Tools of Death. A philanthropist is murdered but not by any of the three weapons found nearby. There is a confession, but Fr. Brown decides if it is true.
6) The Mirror of the Magistrate. A man makes news by exposing German spies in London, then is found shot. Fr. Brown exonerates the prime suspect.

47594,5771,1850,"**some spoilers I guess?  Maybe?**

Something odd about the way this film was shot made it feel low budget, but it engaged in some very compelling bits of subtle, paranoia-laced horror early on, particularly with the way people continuously stared at Jennifer, in a way that could easily just be normal yet when amplified through the uncomfortable eyes of the protagonist, come across almost paranormal in how unsettling it is.

When it does start up with its Haunted House Shenanigans, it tends to do so in a way in some rather straightforward ways, with noises and shadows and visual hallucinations, all done in a style to make it rather unclear as to whether its an actual haunting or all in Jennifer's mind. Certain physical feats (such as a broken wooden door) seem too extreme to just be in her head, but are extremely plausible to actually be just in her head (the door was old and likely damaged from mildew and humidity).

The film does a great job despite its low budget look and feel at hooking you in and keeping you as perpetually tense and paranoid as Jennifer. There seems to be a breakthrough with the character Walter at one point which further adds to the mystery as to whether this is even some manner of ""ghost"" or some other inexplicable phenomenon.

Where it completely falls apart is near the end, in a conversation/expo-dump with Walter, where he goes and explains that it isn't an actual ghost haunting but... ""Energy""

Namely, Jennifer's ""energy"" is like, just so intense, you know, so it, like, manifests in spooky ways.

You see, like, her like ""energy"" like interacts with other people's ""energy"" and other thing's ""energy"" and that causes Jennifer to savagely beat herself up and destroy everything. Because since she wants to not live in the house, her ""energy"" is causing her to self destruct and destroy everything around her in a fitful desire to move out of the house.

Leaving aside the fact that energy doesn't work that way, this pseudo-science ""magic"" feels extremely close to astrology, with the idea that people's ""energy"" or more accurately ""midichlorians"" vibrate in some magic way that cause actual physical effects in the world, which in turn also has magic that interacts with them.  If this were the case, everyone's magic energy would be blinded, deafened, and drowned by the overwhelming nuclear ""energy"" of the sun every single day.",1526774400,2,spoiler guess mayb someth odd way film shot made feel low budget engag compel bit subtl paranoialac horror earli particularli way peopl continu stare jennif way could easili normal yet amplifi uncomfort eye protagonist come across almost paranorm unsettl start haunt hous shenanigan tend way rather straightforward way nois shadow visual hallucin done style make rather unclear whether actual haunt jennif mind certain physic feat broken wooden door seem extrem head extrem plausibl actual head door old like damag mildew humid film great job despit low budget look feel hook keep perpetu ten paranoid jennif seem breakthrough charact walter one point add mysteri whether even manner ghost inexplic phenomenon complet fall apart near end conversationexpodump walter goe explain isnt actual ghost haunt energi name jennif energi like intens know like manifest spooki way see like like energi like interact peopl energi thing energi caus jennif savag beat destroy everyth sinc want
47595,193,1100,"Excellent movie and introduction to a reimagined Star Trek universe. It is to the original Star Trek like the Battlestar Galactica reboot was to that original. J. J. Abrams rocked the new version.

Here is what I like:
+ much more fully formed than the original
+ a darker take with faster pace that is compelling
+ excellent casting, especially Spock (all 3 - young, adult and alternate universe), Bones and Scotty
+ I am very happy that Leonard Nimoy appears here and ties this so well to the original
+ how this universe came to be vs the original is explained (kind of a twist on the original ""mirror mirror"" episode)
+ the sets and effects are very well done by today's standards but keeping a sense of the original.
+ there seems just the right amount of humor to keep the mood from going too dark
+ J. J. Abrams did a fantastic job balancing his style with the essence of Star Trek

Here is what might have been better:(but this is pretty nit-picky)
- The Nero and the Romulan crew seem a little ""over the top"" for this new take
- Some things didn't make sense - like old-Spock seeing Vulcan from another star system like he was on a moon

I didn't expect to like this reboot of the original star trek much, but I really do. The sequels (into darkness and beyond) do not seem quite as good to me but certainly very enjoyable. With the passing of Anton Yelchin (plays Pavel Chekov) I wonder if there will be any more sequels. I hope so.

If you are open to a reboot (I was prepared by the Battlestar Galactical one) that honors the original well you'll probably will enjoy this take on the Star Trek universe. It's younger and more hip (am I giving away how old I am?) than the original and TNG variations and exceeded my expectations. I think it deserves 5 stars for sure.

47736,2323,2685,"Granted, I haven't actually read the book that this this movie is supposedly based upon. However, I can't believe that the screenplay is adapted very well from the book series seeing how successful it was vs how horrible this movie turned out to be.

I've seen a lot of Left Behind knockoff movies, as well as a great number of other Christian-themed films. Some of them are very uplifting. Some are just boring and preachy. Others just plain sucked. This one definitely falls into the latter category. Not only is the movie not uplifting, it doesn't even seem to take religion all that seriously. For example, try counting how many times you hear the name Jesus Christ in the movie. I did. It appeared exactly ZERO times. How does a movie that is supposedly based upon the New Testament manage to go 90+ minutes without a single mention of Christ? It really blows my mind when I think about it.

Nic Cage seems to really be phoning in his performance here. There is nothing special about it as compared with the rest of his movie catalog. Most of the rest of the cast is equally unconvincing. There are a lot of really stupid and unconvincing actions by the main characters. Honestly, I started giving up on the movie as soon as the ""rapture"" scene ended and I knew that all of the characters remaining were going to hell anyway. I hope that isn't considered a spoiler, but I'm assuming that most people know what is going to happen going into this film just based upon the title.

47742,2823,4365,"From what I can see, this film was released in 2017 by Sony. It is now having a re-release under Lightyear.

I generally review musicals or mysteries or PBS series here on Amazon but since Im also a CPA (Certified Public Accountant), it peaked my interest just from the title.

Itd a black comedy that is not unlike Coen Brothers films (O Brother Where Art Thou comes to mind.) Its a caricature of southern farmers who are trying to keep their farm. The film  which won an Oscar for best short fiction film  is just 38 minutes so I won't tell you much. The accountant in the title is more of a financial advisor who arrives to help two brothers who are losing their farm to the large mortgage companies and might have to do SERIOUS things to keep them from losing it. Actor Ray McKinnon (who was in O Brother) wrote, directed and stars in this film. His wife is actress Lisa Blount (who Executive Directed it and designed the costumes!).

It took a while to get into it but then I started laughing. It is funny and quirky.
Be aware that there are no bonus features. There are chapter stops but not a chapter menu.

The DVD does have a trailer for another McKinnon film, but I found that one just stupid. The Accountant is worth seeing.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I enjoyed the heck our of watching Bruce Campbell play Michael Doneger's dad. And I hope there are more scripts coming from Doneger. He is talented (and cute, and athletic, and smart, yadda, yadda).

Above all, I think this film is a love letter to L.A. from an East Coast kid.

I started by purchasing Jurassic Park on release day of the original laser disc years ago and have seen varying transfers through the years with ascending formats. I was hesitant when I preordered this set for fear I would be disappointed with the transfer as I am with the 4K release of Die Hard. But I would absolutely recommend anyone to upgrade their collection without fear. Jurassic Park is truly remarkable in its 4K presentation. We all must remember that 4K does not magically change a transfer beyond what the original film maker desired and in this case, Mr. Spielberg does not disappoint. It contains a DTS-X sound  track as well. I viewed this on a 4K 65 inch OLED display and have no hesitation to say to anyone sitting on the fence about this, you will not be disappointed.  I do not say this lightly as I am not a fan who says I love it, no matter what and it's 4K so it has to be great. That said, I have zero regrets and finally have a near demo quality version for my collection. You will find no better version of any movie of this age than this 4K Jurassic Park release.

47842,2860,4443,"My least favorite of the Falls trilogy, due to plot holes. Still a very good film. Spoilers here.

After seeing the first film, I was very invested in RJ and Chris. I am neither gay nor Mormon, just a hopeless romantic, but I really hoped true love would prevail for the star-crossed lovers. I was sold on their romance- it seemed so real.

It is 5 years later, and much has changed. Chris is married to a woman, and RJ is out of the closet, with a steady boyfriend, Paul, but still Mormon-ish. He vacillates between pride and shame. Ferrucci does an excellent job portraying the religious conflict in a subtle way, and his one-sided relationship with Paul.

There is some interesting symbolism woven into the plot. Chris is now a pharmaceutical sales rep, and doing fabulously well, judging by his mansion. Yet pharmaceutical sales in recent years has become notorious for unethical business practices, to say the least. Chris is both selling a lie, and living a heterosexual lie with his wife, played by Hannah Barefoot, a perfect Mormon/Stepford wife. All is not what it seems.

When Rodney, the Iraq veteran, dies the funeral becomes an excuse for Chris to see RJ again. Why else would Chris attend, when he hadn't kept in touch with Rodney for 5 years? Chris is now very conflicted, as he has been through ""reparative therapy"", and is married to a woman. He rebuffs RJ, who returns home with a lot on his mind. RJ realizes he has never gotten over Chris, and he comes clean with Paul, breaking off their relationship.

Shortly thereafter, RJ impulsively shows up uninvited at Chris' front door. Considering that Chris did not respond to his months of calls and letters years ago, and now is married, would RJ really do that? This film is not as fresh and natural as the first.

RJ confronts Chris about being in a fake straight marriage. He is still seeking closure for Chris dropping out of his life after their mission. Chris remains in denial, but after seeing RJ, he cannot function sexually with his wife.

Chris calls RJ. There is a night of passion, and Chris' wife catches them in the act. He then comes out to his immediate family, inviting RJ to be present, which didn't seem very believable. Later, RJ crashes an anniversary party, and plants a passionate kiss, while dozens of aghast friends and family members look on. A little stalker-ish.

There were some excellent performances from RJ's lover, Paul, and Chris' wife, Emily. Both spurned partners really make us feel their pain and confusion..

Despite the weak spots, and occasional stilted dialogue, the chemistry between the two leads is good enough that I'd watch them mow the lawn! Once again, Ferrucci and Farmer shine in their portrayal of two men who long to be together, but are kept apart by their conservative religion.

If youve seen a trailer watch one now if you havent. you can tell it looks a bit like a Cowboy Bebop clone set in the south Asia seas or whatever they say in the show.

But the lead guy isn't some badace bounty hunter, hes an office worker that roped in purely by chance. If you buy and like this, be sure to buy Cowboy Bebop too if you haven't already. Its very similar but was made long before and is set in space.  Anyhow, this show mainly presents stories as multi-episode arcs.  Here a group of mercenaries complete odd jobs while getting into some of the craziest gun fights youll probably ever see, nuff said.

47890,1864,1076,"First of all, I don't know anything about the show on which this movie is based. I went in hoping it would be a solid, meat and potatoes vigilante movie, and for the most part, it delivers. Denzel Washington plays Bob, a mysterious but good-hearted loner and Home Depot...sorry, Home Mart employee. When his friend Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a prostitute employed by the Boston division of the Russian Mob, is horribly abused by a client, Bob takes on her employers in true vigilante fashion. In addition to its immaculate look and feel - cinematographer Mauro Fiore (Avatar) does some very impressive work here - the other quality of this movie that really kept my attention is its skilled character building. From his devotion to his friends to his Inspector Poirot-like precision when it comes to arranging his silverware, Fuqua proves that showing character building is much more compelling than expositing about it. The movie is predictable to a fault - so much so that my interesting took a nosedive at the beginning of the third act - and while watching Bob do what he does to bad guys is compelling as it is gruesome, his near-invincibility makes suspending disbelief difficult and dilutes the stakes. All the same, I still recommend it, especially if your diet of bloodless superhero movie action has left you hungry for the good stuff. It's also worth watching to see David Harbour's pre-Stranger Things turn as a corrupt cop.",1527033600,3,first dont know anyth show movi base went hope would solid meat potato vigilant movi part deliv denzel washington play bob mysteri goodheart loner home depotsorri home mart employe friend teri chloe grace moretz prostitut employ boston divis russian mob horribl abus client bob take employ true vigilant fashion addit immacul look feel cinematograph mauro fior avatar impress work qualiti movi realli kept attent skill charact build devot friend inspector poirotlik precis come arrang silverwar fuqua prove show charact build much compel exposit movi predict fault much interest took nosed begin third act watch bob bad guy compel gruesom nearinvinc make suspend disbelief difficult dilut stake still recommend especi diet bloodless superhero movi action left hungri good stuff also worth watch see david harbour prestrang thing turn corrupt cop

This is not a terrible movie. It's not an excellent movie.
It's a cute move though.

This can be an entertaining movie. It has some good acting and it has moments where it has terrible acting. The plot is ok but it's easy to see who the bad guy is right from the beginning almost. There is a little bit of a romance but it's hard to 'feel the sparks flying' and at the end your not quiet sure why the fell in love since there is so minimal talking between the two.

It has the feel of a fun family flick but then right at the beginning, there is a scene of man making out with three women and right after that a topless woman. This means it's not a family movie that you can sit with Grandpa and the kids and watch it without being embarrassed. Sadly, this is all that stops it from being a fun movie to watch with the family. The violence is minimal, there is no blood, and no swear words.

47925,817,3495,"In fulfillment of the persistent pleas of a viewer, Turner Classic Movies graced its airspace with the three films directed by Ernst Marischka romanticizing the life of Austria's last Empress, Elisabeth, affectionately known as Sissi, in these paradigms of the Heimatfilms(Home films) that were popular with audiences in postwar Germany and Austria. For many years, the airing of these films on television was a Christmastime tradition in several European countries.  Amid  an expressive score by Anton Proved,this endearing saga of a remarkable, tumultuous,(and sadly, ill-fated) life begins.  We observe the home life of Sissi's family at Possenhoven Castle on the shores of Bavaria's Lake Starnberg. Duke Maximilian Josef(Gustav Knuth), and Princess Ludovika(Magda Schneider) preside over a merry brood of eight children , the eldest daughter of whom is called Helena, and affectionately known as Nene( Uta Franz).  Our first sight of 16-year-old Sissi(Magda Schneider's daughter, Romy in her star-turning role,and proving herself to be a fine actress even at a tender age),jumping fences on horseback to her father's amusement and admiration. But we also see how awkward, girlish, and impulsive the  young beauty is.  Still, the girl accompanies her mother and older sister to the north Austrian town of Bad Ischl where Ludovika and her sister,the Austrian Archduchess Sophie (Vilma Degischer) hope to arrange a match between Nene and her son, Emperor Franz Josef(a cleanly handsome Karlheinz Bohm).But an accidental meeting between the Emperor and young Sissi changes the course of history.  After the initial encounter, Franz Josef says he envies the man who will marry Sissi,and ultimately decides to be that man. Before the Kaiser's birthday gala, in which he will announce his choice of bride, Sissi expresses her apprehension because she does not wish to betray her sister. Sophie believes the calmer and more pious Nene would be a better Kaiserin for Austria.  But the young Kaiser prevails, and amid beautiful and stately scenes that complement the loving nature of the stunned and reluctant Sissi, we view the reconciliation of the sisters after Nene, who left home for a while, returns with a new suitor, Prince Maximilian Anton von Thurn under Taxis. After Sissi greets her new subjects warmly on a steamboat ride down the Danube to Vienna, she and the Kaiser marry in a beautiful and solemn wedding mass.  The second film, an entry in the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, Sissi, the Young Empress, finds our restless young heroine struggling to adapt to her new life,and dealing with her difficult mother-in-law,who lays claim to Sissi's first child,Archduchess Sophie, after naming the infant for herself. The Emperor's mother feels the teenager too young and inept to raise the child, and that Sissi belongs with her husband on his tour of the Empire. A potential scandal occurs when Sissi returns to her family home in Bavaria, although she initially hides the reason for her return from her mother. The young Kaiser follows her and convinces her to return, and her influence with her husband strengthens.  Together, the Imperial couple tour Hungary,and Sissi supports the cause of equal representation in the Austro-Hungarian Empire advocated by Count Gyula Andrassy(Walther Reyer).In an event tha actually took place a decade later,we see Sissi crowned Queen of Hungary.  The final film, entered in the 1958 Cannes Film Festival, is the 1957 release, Sissi-The Fateful Years of an Empress. Here, we find a slightly more mature Sissi enjoying her visit to Hungary, and while cherishing the political alliance with Count Andrassy, she responds to his confession of love for her by returning to Vienna (although history suggests otherwise). Back home, the Kaiser remains in his office while his mother still limits Sissi's access to her daughter.  After the Imperial couple meet halfway between Austria and Hungary, they vacation at Bad Ischl. But Sissi contracts tuberculosis, managing to comfort her heartbroken husband before being sent to the warm  climate areas of Madeira and Corfu where her mother joins her and helps nurse her. Archduchess Sophie, in the meantime, now has a legitimate excuse for keeping Sissi's daughter out of her grasp, which threatens her will to recover.  Following the optimistic pattern of glad reunions with her husband,the couple reunite in Italy after Sissi recovers. They deal with a less-than-amiable reception in Austria's remaining possesions in northern Italy,Milan and Venice.  At the opera house of La Scala, the Italian nobles send only their servants dressed in formal attire to greet the couple as an insult. But another glad family reunion will melt and win Italian hearts.  Josef Meinrad plays Major Bockl,Hans Zuglr plays Dr. Seeburger,Sonia Sorel is Henriette Mendel, Klaus Knuth appears as Prince Ludwig, Albert Ruprecht plays Archduke Ferdinand Max,Walter Regelsberger plays Count Windish-Graetz,  and Erich Nikowitz played Kaiser Franz Karl.  A 1962 composite film, Sissi-Forever My Love,with English dubbing and a theme song performed by Jane Morgan was released in the United States, further enhancing the myth of this beautiful, enigmatic, complicated, but charitable woman.  Those unfamiliar with Sissi's story can defer the unhappy actualities for another time, and just savor the beauty of this sentimental confection of a trilogy paying tribute to a star-crossed beauty who innocently and unintentionally won the heart and hand of an Emperor over a century ago.",1527033600,5,fulfil persist plea viewer turner classic movi grace airspac three film direct ernst marischka romantic life austria last empress elisabeth affection known sissi paradigm heimatfilmshom film popular audienc postwar germani austria mani year air film televis christmastim tradit sever european countri amid express score anton provedthi endear saga remark tumultuousand sadli illfat life begin observ home life sissi famili possenhoven castl shore bavaria lake starnberg duke maximilian josefgustav knuth princess ludovikamagda schneider presid merri brood eight child eldest daughter call helena affection known nene uta franz first sight 16yearold sissimagda schneider daughter romi starturn roleand prove fine actress even tender agejump fenc horseback father amus admir also see awkward girlish impuls young beauti still girl accompani mother older sister north austrian town bad ischl ludovika sisterth austrian archduchess sophi vilma degisch hope arrang match nene son emperor franz josefa cleanli handsom karlheinz bohmbut accident meet emperor young sissi chang cours histori initi encount franz josef say envi man marri sissiand ultim decid man kaiser birthday gala announc choic bride sissi express apprehens wish betray sister sophi believ calmer piou nene would

Can't criticize the acting when they were dealt such a bad card of a script.  From scene to scene there is often pure nothingness... nothing moving the story forward, just one poor directing decision after another.  You can literally list out 3-5 holes, awkward dialogue lines and more per scene, every scene.  I love to give films a chance to entertain... doesn't matter if they have a budget or not, bad acting or not, horribly photographed or not, but when the story is impacted whether in script, editing etc in a such a way where it could have been avoided then I have no choice but to rip it apart.

47988,2118,4004,"Sherlock Holmes, A Game of Shadows, 2011 film

It is 1891, there is conflict in the Continent and bombing in England. A woman walks alone, men follow her. Then they attack Sherlock Holmes, who defeats them. The woman delivers a package, it has an infernal machine inside! Holmes neutralizes it, then leaves. He finds a man dead from a poisoned needle! Later Irene Adler dines with a man in a restaurant. Her services are no longer required. There is a view of late 19th century London, then Holmes lodgings. Dr. Watson visits Holmes to tell of his marriage. Holmes talks of James Moriarity. Holmes leaves in disguise. They meet Holmes brother who works for the Foreign Office. Sherlock meets a fortune teller. There is an attack that is defeated. [This adds action.] Next day Watson weds in an outdoor ceremony. Moriarity sends an invitation to meet Holmes. They talk.

Watson and his wife take the train. A man attacks them but it thrown out. There is shooting in the corridor! [There is quick action that is hard to follow. Does this make sense?] Then they travel to Paris. They meet people and dine on hedgehog goulash. A woman shows her drawings. There is a wine cellar where anarchists meet. Mrs. Watson meets Sherlocks brother Mycroft. Holmes and Watson and the fortune teller look for her brother. Claude no longer has need for his pistol. The three escape through a secret passage to the street, then to a theater where they are performing an opera. There is an explosion in another building where businessmen meet. Holmes deduces where a rifle was fired. Holmes tells about the sale of a cannon business. He deduces which train Moriarity will take to Berlin. Holmes party will ride horses across the border. Holmes visits a factory and is captured! Moriarity is behind the conspiracy.

A sniper shoots at Watson while Moriarity and Holmes converse. A cannon hits the building. Watson comes to help Holmes. There is a chase and gunfire! Another cannon knocks down a wall. There is a running gun battle. Another cannon fires at the fugitives, who hop on to a train to escape. Watson revives Holmes! They discuss the events with Mycroft, who asks for proof. There is a conspiracy to assassinate a politician and cause a war. Holmes attends a ball and tries to figure out the plot. Holmes and Watson dance without attracting attention! [Unbelievable even as a joke.] Then Holmes and Moriarity talk and play chess. The attempt fails! Will that man survive? Holmes tells Moriarity about the theft of his notebook and its decipherment in London. They fight and fall over the railing into the cold water! Watson sees this. There is a memorial service. Watson types this story, then opens a parcel. Who brought it?

Was this one of the worst Holmes movies? Compared to the classic movies where Basil Rathbone acted as the greatest consulting detective in fiction? The story seems confusing at times. John Buchans The 39 Steps remains the classic story about a conspiracy. Alfred Hitchcock filmed this story many times: The 39 Steps, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Foreign Correspondent, North by Northwest. Any of these are better.

I almost rated only a 4 because of the subject matter of American torture and waterboarding and trying to create a crisis over those accusations.....meanwhile nothing is of concern about the radicals cutting off people's heads. But the reality is that the leftists have effectively used these accusations for their political end and it is honest to acknowledge that fact. It is more of a movie about political enemies and how far those enemies within a government will go to eliminate their political opponents...How can your opposition be politically eliminated...and the use of the media in doing so?. It is a low key movie without explosions, automatic weapon fire, car chases and wrecks....and I like that fact. It is more of a verbal movie about relationships and attitude. It is about trust and the lack of trust. They carried that trust thing just a little too far when the hero accepted the neighbor girls friendship without much of a question....but then we do know that government employees are subject to this.",1527120000,5,interest movi polit english polit also could easili american polit almost rate 4 subject matter american tortur waterboard tri creat crisi accusationsmeanwhil noth concern radic cut peopl head realiti leftist effect use accus polit end honest acknowledg fact movi polit enemi far enemi within govern go elimin polit opponentshow opposit polit eliminatedand use medium low key movi without explos automat weapon fire car chase wrecksand like fact verbal movi relationship attitud trust lack trust carri trust thing littl far hero accept neighbor girl friendship without much questionbut know govern employe subject

I saw a real good film biography of the real guy that Cruise is playing in this, and the movie is quite historically accurate.  The actor who played Hitler did it so well  - it took place around D-Day, and he was crazed (not screaming-crazed) and shaky, as we've learned he was in the last part of the war.

The ending was a surprise but I must watch the film again because at the first viewing I sensed that something was amiss.

Set in the outskirts of Ireland, which the show goes to great lengths to remind the viewer (quite effectively I might add) that though it's beautiful, there's a history of suffering, and profound poverty.  The locals, especially the young people can feel isolated and perhaps trapped at times.

This is great story telling in my opinion.  None of the characters are over the top good, or bad.  Seems more like real people.  Most small town cop shows exaggerate the amount of pure violence taking place, to make it more interesting for the viewer.  But this show doesn't fall into that trap. It's more about personality conflict, and the problems of growing up in a town where everyone knows everyone else's business.

Add Danny Trejo's character (the token character in Robert Rodriguez's movies) and no explanation of who or what dropped these characters onto this planet, and you have a mundane recipe for a mediocre Predators movie that pales in comparison to the original Predator film and the Alien vs. Predator franchise.
However... there were several elements of this movie that made it a cut above the original Predator film and the Alien vs. Predator franchise. First, there's a surprise appearance by Laurence Fishburne who dons a Predator mask along with the vade mecum cloaking capability. This was unexpected, but a welcome addition. Second, the concept of predators (criminals, gang members, mercenaries, etc.) being hunted by Predators is interesting and brilliant (though the writers did not sufficiently explain in detail about this). Third, having a new breed of Predators was another unexpected but interesting concept.
The latter scenes of this movie copy scenes and dialogue from the original Predator movie, and for that this movie shines but ultimately flounders.
Would I recommend this movie?

48142,1441,638,"Let's face it, Claude Rains is probably elegant even when he's on the crapper. He's one of my favorite character actors of all time. In 1947 he starred in THE UNSUSPECTED, a murder drama that's more suspense than mystery. We know very early on the identity of the killer, and it's Claude Rains. He plays Victor Grandison, a ""renowned writer, art collector, and teller of strange tales."" Grandison is the ""genial host"" of a popular murder mystery radio show (sponsored by United Motors Company, if you were wondering). Observe and absorb Grandison's timing and cultured elocution as he regales his rapt audience with yarns of the macabre and the sinister and of ""the calm and often smiling mask of the unsuspected.""

Perhaps he's so good at his job because he's had experience germane to the subject of homicide. For, you see, Victor Grandison is himself a murderer. In the opening scene, we bear witness as he eliminates his secretary, makes it look like a suicide, never mind that hanging one's self off a chandelier is damn elaborate and tricky thing. If only he'd stopped there, they would've had nothing on him.

For me, one more irresistible draw is Joan Caulfield whom I remember very well for her part in the sparkling, criminally underappreciated DEAR RUTH, one of my favorite comedies. But there's nothing funny in her role in THE UNSUSPECTED. She plays Matilda Frazier, beautiful heiress and Grandison's ward. Matilda is worth millions, so imagine how vigorously them vultures must've circled when it's learned she died on the freighter that burned at sea last month.

And then there's Grandison's penniless niece, Althea Keane (Audrey Totter), who resides on Matilda's grand estate, along with her uncle. Upon learning of Matilda's passing, Althea promptly demonstrates she's no sentimental sob sister. She wastes no time moving into Matilda's bedroom.

One by one, we're introduced to the other participants in this murder drama. The only one left whom I've still to mention is Steven Howard (Michael North). Howard, probably more than any other character, is responsible for driving the narrative. He fosters his own hidden agenda. But who in this movie isn't?

Well, I guess Matilda isn't. She's the most uncomplicated person in this story, and the most oblivious, and, therefore, the most uninteresting. The movie makes it so that her resting mood is that being perpetually distraught. Good thing Caulfield is such a stunning looker.

Honestly, the two most interesting characters are Grandison and Althea, courtesy of Rains and Trotter' knack for adroit habitation of their roles. I already knew Rains was the consummate performer, with his velvet voice, flawless urbanity, and unflappable pulse lending a chilling element to his being the serial murderer. But it's Audrey Totter who knocked my socks off with how catty and loose-moraled and disillusioned and brittle she was. Whenever she was on screen, it was seriously entertaining. Althea Keane made it her mission to each time be the life of the party. The poor girl, it's her way of compensating for what she lacks: money, love, companionship, self-worth... Anyway, Totter is terrific.

It's expertly directed by Michael Curtiz. He makes it effortless to keep up with the twists and turns of the plot - and there's a heap of twists and turns. Just because we already know who the killer is doesn't mean we still can't be kept biting our nails, nerves all jangled up.

I have two nitpicks in what otherwise would be a flawless film. One is that I didn't quite buy the romance that springs up and felt that it required more screen time to develop. The other is that it seemed to me that Grandison's stooge panicked for no reason. All guy had to do was stay calm and drive normally and he would've gotten away okay.

And there's always a twin frisson of nostalgia and, I dunno, regret that surges thru me when I watch these old movies and I see things that aren't around anymore. Case in point, the Pan American World Airways jet that Matilda boards. I remember PanAm!

Now that I've finally gotten to see it, I have mixed feelings. The first two-thirds of the movie are fine. As others have mentioned, however, I feel it loses its way in the last 30 minutes or so.

Some reviewers have objected to the overuse of CGI, but it isn't used as often as one might think.

The character of Mama is played by an actual person by the name of Javier Botet. He's 6'7"" and weighs less than 100 lbs. This is due to his having Marfan Syndrome, a disorder that also allows him to move his body and limbs in very unnatural ways. Just Google his name and/or search for it on YouTube and you'll see what I mean.

Yes, some digitizing was necessary to enhance Mama's appearance -- most notably, her hair. I don't know that it could have been done using practical effects. CGI is also used elsewhere for effects that, IMO, couldn't have been achieved any other way. But I never felt the movie was clobbering me with it.

There are jump scares, although none of them actually made me jump. I was never really scared, either, although Mama's ""voice"" and Lilly, the younger daughter, pretty much creeped me out.

Despite its flaws, I recommend Mama to anyone who enjoys horror and the supernatural.

His mother however has a different opinion. If you are a Christian you will probably find this very amusing. I laughed several times and really enjoyed how cute this was.

In this film the parents are fools and the children figure everything out, and tell the parents off.

48297,248,3048,"Well, the bottom line is that this updated version of the original five season, blockbuster Upstairs Downstairs does not hold a candle to the original. After watching season one of the new update, other than Eileen Atkins' absolutely stellar  performance, I found season 1 to be rather disappointing in terms of the script. So, I was disheartened to learn that Ms. Atkins would not be returning to star in season 2, due to a disagreement with the turn the scripts were taking.

Well, Ms. Atkins was correct in her assessment. Despite excellent performances by the talented cast, the scripts were leaden and lacking incoherent storytelling or any  real character development. In fact, many of the characters were not particularly likable. To add insult to injury, the script was laden with twenty first century social mores overlaid on a 1930s England. This served up a total lack of  authenticity of time and place, despite the beautiful sets. This updated series is simply one hot mess, and I was not surprised to discover that season two is its last.",1527379200,2,well bottom line updat version origin five season blockbust upstair downstair hold candl origin watch season one new updat eileen atkin absolut stellar perform found season 1 rather disappoint term script dishearten learn m atkin would return star season 2 due disagr turn script take well m atkin correct ass despit excel perform talent cast script leaden lack incoher storytel real charact develop fact mani charact particularli likabl add insult injuri script laden twenti first centuri social more overlaid 1930 england serv total lack authent time place despit beauti set updat seri simpli one hot mess surpris discov season two last

48323,2715,643,"The Da Vinci Code was one of the most anticipated movies of the 2000s, and upon its hyped release, was met with lukewarm reviews. For a filmmaker who constantly pushes his heroes to the breaking point, Howard does not go easy on Hanks in the sequel, and in turn creates one of the most satisfying follow-ups to a disappointment. Whereas The Da Vinci Code was a murder mystery, Angels & Demons is a ticking-time-bomb thriller with more energy and an eerie level of macabre.

Tom Hanks/Robert Langdon is just the smart man in the prequel, yet in Angels & Demons the Catholic Church gets to challenge him back. Additionally, the casting of Ayelet Zureh tags a subliminal romantic tension for Langdon  which is often a narrative vantage point which Howard uses in flushing out his characters. Digging into Langdons character lends more for the audiences to invest in; similar to A Beautiful Mind and Frost/Nixon, the more desperate the situation becomes, the more we see the characters develop.

Furthermore, the Robert Langdon films owe a debt of gratitude to the masterful score of Hans Zimmer. The music and songs of Howards films are essential to the tone, particularly the spirited themes in the finales (few of Howards films ever quietly fade to black). Zimmers requiem Gregorian chants for The Da Vinci Code are ideal, yet in Angels & Demons he outdoes himself, setting the film on a higher plateau from standard popcorn flick.",1527465600,4,da vinci code one anticip movi 2000 upon hype releas met lukewarm review filmmak constantli push hero break point howard go easi hank sequel turn creat one satisfi followup disappoint wherea da vinci code murder mysteri angel demon tickingtimebomb thriller energi eeri level macabr tom hanksrobert langdon smart man prequel yet angel demon cathol church get challeng back addit cast ayelet zureh tag sublimin romant tension langdon often narr vantag point howard use flush charact dig langdon charact lend audienc invest similar beauti mind frostnixon desper situat becom see charact develop furthermor robert langdon film owe debt gratitud master score han zimmer music song howard film essenti tone particularli spirit theme final howard film ever quietli fade black zimmer requiem gregorian chant da vinci code ideal yet angel demon outdo set film higher plateau standard popcorn flick

48362,3435,62,"Until Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) mutates into the burn-victim look-alike, physically regenerative, superhero (who, nevertheless can not regenerate healthy looking skin) there is a lot of male eye candy for those so interested---nothing terribly frontal,sadly, he almost always has a lumpy sweater on, but lots of male eye candy just the same.  Then, he morphs and has to wear the suit.  At this point his gay voice takes over---apparently straight, married, and with children, Reynolds still has a great gay voice (here) which goes on and on and on as the babbling, can't stop talking, narrator for a character who isn't exactly tight with words himself, at least before the mask---to the annoyance to those who are trying to kill him.  And sometimes to the annoyance of the viewer.

The question is, IS Deadpool supposed to be gay?  In other films Reynold's is in I've never seen him in the mile-a-minute-motormouth mode, and he doesn't come across as particularly gay on or off screen, even as one might have said of Jack Benny for example.  So is this characterization meant to convey a gay Super Hero, or is the gay sounding patter not meant to be gay sounding?

A minor consideration, other than for the fact it's near constant.

The film is gory in the extreme.  People don't just get whacked, they get whacked and as they do they spew, spurt, gush, and spin off bloody bits and pieces.

Over all, in an era when every third movie is a Super Hero movie, I'm well over the form and this one did little to restore my enthusiasm.  Then again, the twisted history within ""Wonder Woman"" didn't do much to that end either.  I'm just not a Super Hero fan, and this to me is not that funny (one of the selling points I heard) or all that entertaining, even with all that near nudity on Reynold's part.

From the dialog you would not realize that the actors can and are acting. As the programs progress the stories get weirder to holds your attention. There are also several notable guests including Robbie the Robot that always outsmarts ""The Robot"" (Bob May) The Robot's voice is Dick Tufeld.

We all know the basic story of a saboteur Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris) is too smart for his own good and his sabotage backfires from the start throwing the spaceship into who knows where with him trapped inside. What is worse is he never learns from episode to episode. Prof. John Robinson (Guy Williams) is the good guy father that is always giving one hope of being found or getting back. Maureen Robinson (June Lockhart) is the stereotypical motherly type and is caught occasionally stopping John from beating Zackary's brains out. We have mischievous kids always wandering off to discover the new trouble. And a watered down love interest between daughter Judy (Marta Kristen) and Major Don West (Mark Goddard).

I'm not Catholic but this is bashing Catholics, right there I begin to doubt how factual it is. The ""narrator"" sound like it's computer generated because every sentence has the same rhythm which gets annoying.  A lot of the ""acting"" is very amateurish, in the level of those films done by a small church.  I don't mind an amateur film if it's true.  Because I don't watch most mass marketed violent films,  I frequently end up watching independent films etc.  Just when you add all this together, it doesn't add up to a quality film, which leads me to doubt it's ""experts"" etc.  It reminds me of those You Tube films that twist all kinds of facts.
  I watched almost 2 hours out of 2h 58m over several days.  At this point I quit,  I can't trust anything it says to be true.  It's just a waste of time.

This isn't the only movie that, by the very pronouncement, elevates a particular act to a level that is inappropriate.  You have to wonder why Hollywood is so keen on this kind of promotion.  Are men so suddenly wanting to have the same done to them?  I very much doubt it.  But it would follow that the point is to avoid acknowledging relations with a person.  If you don't see the face, then there is less risk.  Why not, then, use a blow-up doll.

Bother characters are emotionally and sexually dead.  The superbly done tango scene must be from another movie.  These two couldn't have carried it off.

And, there is something pretty sick about the restaurant scene in which the young boy gets ahold of the remote control that operates the vibrating panties, and causes her to have an orgasm.  Pay attention boys, this is how you're being taught to enjoy robotic sex.  (what is the rating on this movie, anyway.  No one under 25 should see it - if anyone should see it).

She should stay in her office and act like a normal secretary. She's miscast in this series anyway. They need a younger woman. She keeps sticking her nose in everything...giving her opinions. And her clothes are horrible...looks like she's wearing cotton housedresses...to her job  as secretary to a top notch lawyer. And lastly, I did receive all the correct discs, though I had to arrange in correct order. But the cases were badly broken and the outer case was torn badly. I tried to tape back the best I could.

48510,54,5001,"It's a Quality Production, but there were a couple of key casting weaknesses, and the Plot was pretty much Laughable.
They try to make it seem like this wistful romantic tale, but it just comes off as lame.

It had potential, but the main guy they cast, to tell the story, was absolutely the wrong man for the job.
Hearing this guy reminisce was unimpressive.

That was enough to deal a killing blow to this film, but what really sunk this ship was the ending.
I won't spoil it for anyone, here, but it was the worst possible way to end the movie, and it made absolutely Zero Sense.

They try to play it off as this romantic, too-cool-for-school sort of farewell, but it was just outrageous.
Preposterous, I tell you, Preposterous! xD

I will also touch on the music, because I think, for a movie that is completely focused around the Music of the Early 20th Century, I found it disappointing.
Don't get me wrong, because Ennio Morricone is one of the greatest film composers of the last century.

If I recall, he did ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"", ""A Fistful of Dollars"", and ""The Mission"", among other things.
All very noteworthy, to my recollection, and the theme from ""The Mission"" was especially moving.

This, however, simply did not Shine.
A lot of busy music, and nothing that really got my attention, but the weird thing was that they always talked about it, in the movie, as though it were spectacular, when it was really very plain.

Not to say that this isn't a movie worth watching, but rather that it was a movie with a lot of quality elements, and a few poor choices that brought it down in big ways.

We are dedicated Insidious fans, but not sure of some of the elements that evolve women. Without going into detail, I prefer not to watch the "" Helpless and victimized"" women movies, Elise is a strong woman, and that's why we love her, and some were not in this movie. I am not sure why the writer had to go here? Then it also went to the young teenager female, as many movies do , which totally sucks, because Elise has earned my respect, and her age is timeless.

48559,2179,5304,"I often tell my wife this is the best police procedural drama ever on TV, and she thinks that opinion is absolutely bizarre. Let me tell you why it's so good:

1. The storyline continually evolves into personal relationships apart and within the police procedural element. Nothing new there, but the writers rarely go for the easy resolution or interaction that the audience wants. I'm not talking about just milking the typical unrequited-love trope (though it's here as well), but all the human relationships that are created. They are nuanced and strong, and each one matters in its own way without suddenly taking over the whole series.

2. The acting is superb, from the recurring characters to the one-hitters.

3. Oddly enough, this series lasts eight season without ever truly jumping the shark. Usually when certain love relationships are resolved or a specific big evil enemy is vanquished, a series completely craters. The writers never gave up on this show, all the way to the end, and it shows.

4. It's funny. And there are plenty of tricky adult (naughty) metaphors tucked within normally dry procedural dialogue.

5. It never strays too far from its main purpose. All the wonderful branching-off aside, the police procedural element is still always there.

6. People they add on later in the series are fun, smart, quirky, and either truly likable or unlikable in quite complicated ways. With great acting again.

7. I've found that some series with throw in some odd things that happen in order to tie in a specific story element, then fail to explain how something preposterous could make sense. CASTLE uses this approach dozens of times, but when a crime scene investigator somehow doesn't use a glove on the scene, for instance, we later find out why. In one episode, it's necessary for Castle to care for a child in the custody of child welfare services, which seems unlikely until we realize that it's Thanksgiving (or Christmas) and that Beckett is a cop so she technically can be a temporary guardian of the child. All this is done without a big glaring sign to tell us so. It's just slipped in quietly.

All in all, an absolutely tremendous series and one of my all-time favorites in any genre.",1527638400,5,often tell wife best polic procedur drama ever tv think opinion absolut bizarr let tell good 1 storylin continu evolv person relationship apart within polic procedur element noth new writer rare go easi resolut interact audienc want im talk milk typic unrequitedlov trope though well human relationship creat nuanc strong one matter way without suddenli take whole seri 2 act superb recur charact onehitt 3 oddli enough seri last eight season without ever truli jump shark usual certain love relationship resolv specif big evil enemi vanquish seri complet crater writer never gave show way end show 4 funni plenti tricki adult naughti metaphor tuck within normal dri procedur dialogu 5 never stray far main purpos wonder branchingoff asid polic procedur element still alway 6 peopl add later seri fun smart quirki either truli likabl unlik quit complic way great act 7 ive found seri throw odd thing happen order tie specif stori element fail explain someth preposter could make sen castl use approach dozen time crime scene investig somehow doesnt use glove scene instanc later find one

48608,5437,3267,"I watched this movie solely for the special effects, as they seemed so highly touted.  And they were
good, but were too overdone, to the point of diluting excitement and awe.  They ramped up into
what I call ""finale mode"" much too quickly.  By the time Washington DC or Paris, etc.,  fell to annihilation,
it seemed fairly blase.  I mean, once you've seen a major metropolis engulfed in balls of fire, or sloughing off
into the ocean, you've seen them all.  That's the frame of mind I fell into too early in the film.  And the
dangers the protagonists encountered were WAY too close, way too over-the-top and ridiculous to be anything
but cartoonish.  It so completely put a distance to any sort of reality, that tension and suspense suffered as a result.

I won't go into all the defects of writing and predictability, which other reviewers have already pointed out.
I am just disappointed that a film with this budget and tech talent could not do more with it.  It was merely
your basic, any-scale disaster story with completely unoriginal characters and dialog.  All the standard
""tug at the heart"" scenes were included; all the bland and expected ""moments of humor""; everything we've
seen a hundred times before, and even if we haven't, it still felt like it.  There should have been a greater sense
of the momentous, a different atmosphere conveying the horror, the awe of such unprecedented events;
but it somehow only conveyed a localized sense of urgency occasioned by any immediate danger.

There are a few things I'll mention, just to illustrate.  Several major areas of earth have been decimated;
no doubt billions are already dead.  And heads of state are reluctant to ""go public"", for fear of creating
panic and anarchy?  Sorry, guys, but I think you're out of the loop by this point.  And so many, many
minor points of near-impossibility that it becomes a major mass in the way of credulity:  people still
able to opportunely communicate on cell phones; everybody managing to get to China in what seems
a couple of hours; one of the main characters calls his estranged son in the midst of this global chaos,
and the ringing phone wakes him & his family from a sound and apparently blissfully unaware sleep.
I mean, only someone on a Mars colony could have been ignorant of what was going on in the world
by that point.  The one line in the whole film which was gratifying to me was when one of the lead
scientists confronts a wealthy industrialist as they were boarding the ""ark"", and lectures him on the
morality of ""buying"" his way onto the ark, while millions of poorer folk were to be left to die.  And the
industrialist says ""You can give your own tickets to them if you want, I don't care,"" and continues to board,
leaving the moralist looking befuddled, then meekly following industrialist onto the ship.  It showed the
hypocrisy which is rampant in the world today, and I'm surprised it was included in any film made in
the past decade.  I guess they just figured few people would notice it.

I will give it 3 stars, for I was able to watch the whole thing, the acting was completely adequate, and
the technical aspects were professionally done.  It was just the triteness of the story, the unoriginal
character types, the overwhelming feeling I'd seen all this before even though the scale of the setting
was so much larger--just the sameness and lack of anything substantially new--kept me from rating
it higher.",1527724800,3,watch movi sole special effect seem highli tout good overdon point dilut excit awe ramp call final mode much quickli time washington dc pari etc fell annihil seem fairli blase mean youv seen major metropoli engulf ball fire slough ocean youv seen that frame mind fell earli film danger protagonist encount way close way overthetop ridicul anyth cartoonish complet put distanc sort realiti tension suspens suffer result wont go defect write predict review alreadi point disappoint film budget tech talent could mere basic anyscal disast stori complet unorigin charact dialog standard tug heart scene includ bland expect moment humor everyth weve seen hundr time even havent still felt like greater sen moment differ atmospher convey horror awe unpreced event somehow convey local sen urgenc occas immedi danger thing ill mention illustr sever major area earth decim doubt billion alreadi dead head state reluct go public fear creat panic anarchi sorri guy

48629,157,39,"The Thing (2011) is a nice prequel to the The Thing (1982) which itself was a remake of a film from a few decades before that.  In fact the end scenes of this film are the opening scenes of John Carpenter's film.  This film is more like a remake though, although it's probably more authentic that the Norwegian base would have the same sort of equipment (flamethrowers and so forth) that the American one had so they would cope with the same threat the same way.  But you can't help but think when seeing characters do the same thing, that gee it would have been nice to come up with something new.  But saying that this is still enjoyable.  The creature in this one seemed to be a bit more intelligent or smoothly able to pretend it's one of the crew than it could at the American base.  I wondered in this one why no one tries having a conversation with it, reasoning with it to spare them and they'll help it with its needs.  Where as the 1982 version it was simply a wounded creature trying to survive, masking it's predators so it could wipe out this threat to itself.  The CGI is heavily used in the prequel, which I think takes away some of what made the original the cult classic it is. They should have invested in robotic puppets.

You can see why this prequel wasn't more successful.  It called itself the exact same title, confusing many that it was a remake and we all know how some people automatically pan remakes, not giving them a chance, even though they've never seen them because it's somehow going to ruin the original, even though that makes absolutely no sense.  It doesn't have A-list actors as a draw card.  The ones do a perfectly adequate job.  But if you're a fan of the 1982 film, you should definitely check it out.  If you haven't seen that, you should watch these back to back.",1527724800,4,thing 2011 nice prequel thing 1982 remak film decad fact end scene film open scene john carpent film film like remak though although probabl authent norwegian base would sort equip flamethrow forth american one would cope threat way cant help think see charact thing gee would nice come someth new say still enjoy creatur one seem bit intellig smoothli abl pretend one crew could american base wonder one one tri convers reason spare theyll help need 1982 version simpli wound creatur tri surviv mask predat could wipe threat cgi heavili use prequel think take away made origin cult classic invest robot puppet see prequel wasnt success call exact titl confus mani remak know peopl automat pan remak give chanc even though theyv never seen somehow go ruin origin even though make absolut sen doesnt alist actor draw card

48658,93,2910,"Wow! All I can say is if you get the chance to own THIS 4K set of the first 4 Jurassic Park movies, invest in it!
I just watched the first 2 today and they are incredible. The first one is flawless, meaning that it still looks fabulous 25 years from the making of it. There is no dirt at all throughout the film. I have a 55"" Ultra 4K and kudos to Universal for THIS box set!
I think it is much better in design overall than the white Blu-ray version that has been out for the 4 movies.
Some reviews have been attached to this BOX SET below and you can see what I am talking about.
**** The slipcover of the 4K set is actually embossed with the Jurassic Park logo. Very nice touch. The foldout inside has the discs in their own individual sleeves with nicely done graphic photos throughout the ""book"".
THIS IS THE SET TO GET folks! With 4K taking the center stage now in home video viewing, these movies have renewed life in the Ultra Format.
The difference now is the color spectrum that comes with Ultra 4K and the picture is superior to previous releases.
As with any discs housed in sleeve type cases, handle with care is the standard procedure. The inside of the sleeves that house the discs are coated and slick, so it looks as though they should never scratch any surface for years of enjoyment.
Another reviewer says that part 4 in the series doesn't look that good. Well, it does and it is an improvement over the standard blu-ray that's been out for a few years. 4K is the way to go on this series.

48724,5378,5676,"Absolutely a 5-star movie.
 I read some of the other reviews and I see that some people felt this drama was great too. Others found it boring or did not like to be given a morality lesson. Personally I was riveted to my chromebook every minute - that is after the opening scenes where the fat, cigar-smoking Limey capitalist and his proper, well-to-do family indulged in being fat, liquer-drinking, proper English capitalist blood-sucking oppressors of the disenfranchised - as the inspector insolently brought the upper-class ivory-tower dwelling, selfish, self-righteous, smug individuals down to the earth that most of us millions of poor people live in.
He stuck to the point, which was to get each member of this family to face their culpability in the death of a young woman, not letting them distract him from the inquiry with their airs of privilege and superiority .
Each member of the cast - all of them unknown to me - was perfect for the character he-and-she played and each one was brought down to harsh reality when confronted by his/her part in the tragedy.
The ending, though, well it was mysterious all right. I read that some critics thought the inspector himself was a ghost. A ghost? That didn't help clear up the mystery for me.
It was pretty clearly black-and-white, right-vs-wrong to me until the inspector left them.
Then it got murky and the fat, cigar-chomping, capitalist oppressor thought maybe they were off the hook - so? He was in danger of losing the life-altering lesson that they all had just learned - had jammed down their throats by the inspector - that with privilege comes responsibility. But the young man of the family and the daughter too,  remained shocked by the horror of their crimes and maybe could grow to be decent human beings despite being members of British upper-class.
And then the ominous dramatic phone call that brought them all clashing down again: the young woman went through with what the inspector had said - I don't want to give the story away too much so
I won't.
Easy to criticize rich, irresponsible, greedy people for being so callous and indifferent to the sufferings they visit on unimpowered people because of their short-sighted, self-righteous attitude, but in the end
I could relate to them all too, mostly the son who was seemingly the most guilty and certainly the most shocked by the harm they had caused.
And in my own small way, on a lesser scale, being poor and unempowered, I am ashamed to think that I have done the same kind of harm.
As the inspector says we are all part of this humanity and we all must have empathy for each other and take care not to do harm to each other - or else God help us.",1527897600,5,absolut 5star movi read review see peopl felt drama great other found bore like given moral lesson person rivet chromebook everi minut open scene fat cigarsmok limey capitalist proper welltodo famili indulg fat liquerdrink proper english capitalist bloodsuck oppressor disenfranchis inspector insol brought upperclass ivorytow dwell selfish selfright smug individu earth u million poor peopl live stuck point get member famili face culpabl death young woman let distract inquiri air privileg superior member cast unknown perfect charact heandsh play one brought harsh realiti confront hisher part tragedi end though well mysteri right read critic thought inspector ghost ghost didnt help clear mysteri pretti clearli blackandwhit rightvswrong inspector left got murki fat cigarchomp capitalist oppressor thought mayb hook danger lose lifealt lesson learn jam throat inspector privileg come respons young man famili daughter remain shock horror crime mayb could grow decent human be despit member

48726,580,724,"Hanna is a truly blistering espionage thriller by director Joe Wright. Hanna is probably my favorite film from Wright to date. It is fast paced, exhilarating, and interesting. Wright has crafted a wholly original spy movie that oozes creativity. Every scene has cool shots and wonderfully executed panning shots. Impressive sequence after sequence line every scene of Hanna. You will be amazed and entertained by this movie for sure. Wright perfected the action film with Hanna.

Acting wise, Hanna has a delight cast of characters that emote their respective figures with surrealistic zeal. Saoirse Ronan makes for a deadly killer and a sweet heroine. She is fierce and believable as a spy, while also conveying Hanna's childish nature. Eric Bana is at his best as Hanna's tough, yet kind father. He is very cool as a spy. Cate Blanchett and Tom Hollander are two of the creepiest villains in film history. They will unsettle and threaten you. All in all, Hanna has a well cast ensemble.

Musically, Hanna is exciting and loud with a fresh electronic score from The Chemical Brothers. The bass will blast, the synths will reverberate, and the themes will soar into your ears. Hanna's soundtrack is quite memorable. I have not felt such thrills in a spy thriller since The Bourne Trilogy.

In short, Joe Wright's innovative direction focuses this neat narrative into a non-stop feature. The lovely Saoirse Ronan will captivate you throughout Hanna. You will root for her to triumph. Sit back and enjoy the music, action, acting, and direction.

This was the highest grossing Swedish film in 2015, so that gives you a good feel for what you get. The plot is pretty well defined, the 100 year old man, played by Robert Gustaffson, climbs out a window and disappears. We follow him and his exploits, and they are exploits. Very funny is places, and the bumbling characters we meet along the way are often hysterical. The film is in English, somet8mes in the language of the country that Allan is visiting. The film is never dull, and the acting by all is excellent. The storyline flows along, and can be compared to Forrest Gump at times, but I enjoyed this film so much more.

I watched the entirety of the seasons available, which was thru Season Five, I think. You never like to see main characters, whom you've grown attached to, get taken out. It's a tragic thing but that's in the last one I viewed. Terrible let down. Overall, DCI Banks was a great series and has the edge to continue on, but highly unlikely. Acting wasn't so good and DCI Banks' character seemed to be off the wall with his temper, most times, as if he'd have a stroke. Overkill in his character representation. His dark haired CI agent was probably the most believable character in this entire series with her ""stick to the rules"" methods, calm and cold at times manner. This actress is very good.

Well, maybe there were 3 things... I dunno why the hell she married that 3rd one, he was a real psycho. Anyway, it's not as bad as some of these reviews would have you believe.

Something hatches from a slimy, nasty egg that two geniuses find near the beach where a party is in progress being promoted under ""Vegas rules"", meaning that what happens on the Beach stays on the beach, so the WIC (wiseass in charge) collects all the phones and locks them in the trunk (big problem). We never see the creature (until the last few moments, and then only a part), but that is not unusual, (not optimal, but not unusual). However, in this case, one cannot even imagine what the creature looks like, or how it manages to occupy what is perhaps an acre of land occupying only the interstitial space between the tiny grains of sand, or how it manages to produce carnivorous hairs, or why it eats birds, people, and hot dogs. Perhaps I am overthinking this.

Now the good. - the girls are beautiful, the beach is beautiful, the creature is beautiful (glowing and fluorescing), even the boys are beautiful. the only exception is Gilbert, a rather plump fellow, who spends is stuck in a trash can.

48831,580,1838,"My favorite espionage film!

Director Tomas Alfredson crafted the ultimate slow burn spy thriller. Whispers and traitors are around every corner in this Cold War tale that is chilling. The crystal clear shots and cinematography transport you to another time. The period accurate outfits and makeup create a verisimilitude to the time.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a thoughtful take on complex spy narrative. Filled with political intrigue if you are willing to follow along. The music from composer Alberto Iglesias wrote the most beautiful and understated score for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. There is sweet jazz and lots of delicate piano melodies to listen to while you watch.

Notably, the acting from the entire ensemble is excellent and nuanced. You get the greatest Gary Oldman performance in his career as the ever observant spy Smiley. Oldman's use of his eyes and face to act make for a rather understated role, but he is brilliant all the same. You are constantly wondering what he is thinking. It is a master class in reserved acting.

Furthermore, Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy give their most reserved acting showing their versatility. Colin Firth, John Hurt, Simon McBurney, David Dencik, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Ciarn Hinds, and Stephen Graham all deliver intricate performances to put you off who the mole is really. Svetlana Khodchenkova has a nice smaller role as a Russian informant that you will undoubtedly sympathize with by the end. All in all, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is well cast down to the smallest role.

In short, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is an espionage film like no other. Clever and twisting through the spy world. You will certainly have to think to understand this well written plot, but the process is enjoyable to the end. I love this film and I hope more viewers will get the opportunity to experience it.",1527984000,5,favorit espionag film director toma alfredson craft ultim slow burn spi thriller whisper traitor around everi corner cold war tale chill crystal clear shot cinematographi transport anoth time period accur outfit makeup creat verisimilitud time tinker tailor soldier spi thought take complex spi narr fill polit intrigu will follow along music compos alberto iglesia wrote beauti underst score tinker tailor soldier spi sweet jazz lot delic piano melodi listen watch notabl act entir ensembl excel nuanc get greatest gari oldman perform career ever observ spi smiley oldman use eye face act make rather underst role brilliant constantli wonder think master class reserv act furthermor benedict cumberbatch tom hardi give reserv act show versatil colin firth john hurt simon mcburney david dencik tobi jone mark strong ciarn hind stephen graham deliv intric perform put mole realli svetlana khodchenkova nice smaller role russian inform undoubtedli sympath end tinker tailor soldier spi well cast smallest role short tinker tailor soldier spi espionag film like clever twist spi world certainli think understand well written plot process enjoy end love film hope

Ryan was lonely and trying to struggle with being in the closet in a religious environment. That's a well worn theme, but having it take place in a seminary was different.

48866,7300,4443,"Wow - after reading all of those dreamy 5-star reviews, it is clear why most marriages end in divorce and why gay male relationships are so difficult. The first 40 minutes of this film were really great. Things went over a cliff, however, when RJ flies to Salt Lake City and shows up on the doorsteps of his married ex-boyfriend's home. Clearly unwelcomed, he gets himself invited to dinner and becomes an overnight guest. Then he meets up with this married man, gives him his number, and restarts an ""affair"" that ended 5 years in the past - when they were 20yo. I left out the part about him leaving a good-looking well-adjusted man who is out of the closet and in love with him -- and who had just met his parents days earlier. So, yeah, I don't have much empathy for RJ. I actually felt sorry for Chris. The closet is awful; being in a fake marriage is awful; but who needs a stalking ex lover to ""rescue"" you from your bad choices? No one.

48868,2198,5477,"Anyone who is a fan and lover of animation has (and should) seen at least one film by Studio Ghibli, and its acclaimed writer and director, Hayao Miyazaki. His beautiful and stunning movies are known the world over, and has inspired artists everywhere. Although Miyazaki wasn't in the director's chair this time around, director Isao Takahata presents us a beautifully animated story, and considering this was the last film he directed before his passing, it's an amazing film to ""go out on"" as it were.

A bamboo cutter is out working the fields when he discovers a miniature girl inside a glowing bamboo shoot. Believing her to be a divine presence, he and his wife decide to raise her as their own, calling her ""Princess"". The girl grows rapidly and conspicuously, causing her parents to marvel and earning her the nickname ""Little Bamboo"" from the other village children.  The girl lives a happy, carefree childhood, until her father comes upon gold and fine cloth in the bamboo grove in the same way he found his daughter. He takes these as proof of her divine royalty and begins planning to make her a proper princess. He relocates the family to the capital, forcing her to leave her friends behind. Soon, the girl,  now named ""Princess Kaguya"", begins to struggle with her self-identity as she's unwillingly groomed for royalty....and the more her supernatural powers start to emerge, the more she realizes she'll have to confront the reasons she came to Earth to begin with...and the forces coming to take her back.

The visuals and animation, as per usual in a Ghibli film, are utterly breathtaking to look at and watch. The amount of sheer detail put into every background and character movement is incredible, and it makes scenes come alive in such a way that the lines between fantasy and reality become more and more blurred. What makes this film stand out even more from Studio Ghibli's other movies is the art style. Rather than traditional animation, it takes the form of a moving watercolor painting---giving the film a very unique feel, as if we're watching a storybook come to life.

As for the story, it's apparently based off one of the oldest stories in Japanese folklore, ""The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.""  And after researching it, the film is actually extremely faithful to the old story. Without spoiling much, it could also be seen as one of history's first science fiction stories, and I can agree with that opinion, considering that I was constantly drawing parallels to Superman throughout watching this (being from another world, lands on Earth, raised by a kind couple on a farm, has superpowers, etc.). Kaguya herself is a very likeable character, and despite her supernatural origins, anyone could still relate to her and her struggle to figure out her place in the world. Though her father is well meaning and just wants what's best for her, it's clear that Kaguya grows exponentially miserable when she isn't allowed to do the things that truly make her happy. And when her supernatural origins finally catch up with her, she's left with the difficult choice of either remaining on Earth or returning to her people.

With amazing animation, this is an interesting take on one of the earliest fairy tales ever written, and even though the story is so old, it still holds up even to this day, with important lessons in staying true to yourself, learning what true love really is, what it means to be human, forging a family no matter where you come from, and that for all the bad things in the world, there's an equal and even greater amount of good.",1528070400,4,anyon fan lover anim seen least one film studio ghibli acclaim writer director hayao miyazaki beauti stun movi known world inspir artist everywher although miyazaki wasnt director chair time around director isao takahata present u beauti anim stori consid last film direct pas amaz film go bamboo cutter work field discov miniatur girl insid glow bamboo shoot believ divin presenc wife decid rais call princess girl grow rapidli conspicu caus parent marvel earn nicknam littl bamboo villag child girl live happi carefre childhood father come upon gold fine cloth bamboo grove way found daughter take proof divin royalti begin plan make proper princess reloc famili capit forc leav friend behind soon girl name princess kaguya begin struggl selfident she unwillingli groom royaltyand supernatur power start emerg realiz shell confront reason came earth begin withand forc come take back visual anim per usual ghibli film utterli breathtak look watch amount sheer detail put everi background charact movement incred make scene come aliv

That's a word that shouldn't be thrown around lightly but in this case I feel that it's more than appropriate in describing this excellent Australian crime drama. Simply put, ""Janet King: The Enemy Within"" is a very well written, complex story that focuses on a number of social issues ranging from malfeasance in office to the often too cozy relationship between police and judges; from the hard choices parents must make when raising children to the difficulties women often face in the workplace where they are seldom taken seriously despite their education and experience.
And it asks the question, just how many rules should law enforcement bend or break in pursuit of ""the greater good.""
An excellent cast led by veteran actor Marta Dusseldorp does justice to some really fine writing throughout the series and the direction is smooth. The pacing of each episode is such that viewers have a real opportunity to invest in the characters and their struggles as King, a crown prosecutor, attempts to figure out what's going on after a senior police official who has been charged with a crime is murdered.
The verdict, your honor, is that ""Janet King: The Enemy Within"" is guilty of being an excellent series.",1528070400,5,intens that word shouldnt thrown around lightli case feel appropri describ excel australian crime drama simpli put janet king enemi within well written complex stori focus number social issu rang malfeas offic often cozi relationship polic judg hard choic parent must make rais child difficulti woman often face workplac seldom taken serious despit educ experi ask question mani rule law enforc bend break pursuit greater good excel cast led veteran actor marta dusseldorp justic realli fine write throughout seri direct smooth pace episod viewer real opportun invest charact struggl king crown prosecutor attempt figur what go senior polic offici charg crime murder verdict honor janet king enemi within guilti excel seri

48908,1608,5676,"An Inspector Calls began as a morality play and has been well received several times. It is now a film, and without much fanfare I discovered it on Amazon Prime.

We find the world of 1912 and meet the Birling family, who are celebrating their daughters engagement. After dinner,an unexpected caller, Inspector Goole, played by David Thewlis. Remember him from the most recent Fargo series on television, he is as good in this film. Inspector Goole has come to ask the family questions about a young womans suicide. Each member discovers their part in this event, and it is something to behold.

Ken Stott, plays the insufferable Mr Birling and Miranda Richardson, is his smug insufferable wife. Their daughter, her fianc, and the unhappy son of the family, all come to play a part. The Inspector is unnerving, and is able to question them all with unstinting honesty. This is a wonderful film to see in these amoral times. A tale of morality and how we treat each other is the message,and it was well done and well received.

48909,2260,1834,"At its core, good science fiction must have the same elements that good mysteries do.
That is to say it needs well-thought-out characters, interesting plots, and a few twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing, which, in turn, helps to keep its audience invested in the narrative.
""Dark Matter"" has all three of those elements plus a fourth: When they are rudely awakened from stasis because of a life-threatening on-board  emergency, its crew members cannot remember who they are or why they are on a mysterious spaceship cruising through the galaxy on a course to an unknown destination.
Why they have a collective case of amnesia is a mystery; what their mission is, and how they came to be together are also mysteries.
It's an intriguing concept; one that helps make ""Dark Matter"" a cut above many other sci-fi programs that have come along in recent years.
That's a tribute to the writers who, throughout the season, do a very good job of gradually revealing who the crew members are and what their original mission was. The writers also do a good job of balancing action scenes with scenes that allow viewers to get inside the heads of the main characters. As a bonus, they also have added just enough humor to balance out those action and introspection scenes.
The writers have also done a pretty good job when it comes to creating a universe in which gigantic corporations essentially run things unchecked by any governmental agencies. These corporations have their own armies and run roughshod over anything or anyone who gets in their way. Given the current state of affairs on Planet Earth, that's a believable scenario.
The series falls a little short, however, when it comes to the continuity of the narrative. I won't discuss that in detail because to do so would probably reveal too much about that narrative and, thus, spoil the experience for those that have not yet seen the show. I will say, however, that there is a surprise twist in the cliffhanger ending to this season that left me shaking my head because it felt like the writers had decided that they needed something to shake up the narrative even if it meant introducing a whole new storyline.
Despite that, this is very good science fiction and worth 4.5 stars.",1528070400,4,core good scienc fiction must element good mysteri say need wellthoughtout charact interest plot twist turn keep viewer guess turn help keep audienc invest narr dark matter three element plu fourth rude awaken stasi lifethreaten onboard emerg crew member cannot rememb mysteri spaceship cruis galaxi cours unknown destin collect case amnesia mysteri mission came togeth also mysteri intrigu concept one help make dark matter cut mani scifi program come along recent year that tribut writer throughout season good job gradual reveal crew member origin mission writer also good job balanc action scene scene allow viewer get insid head main charact bonu also ad enough humor balanc action introspect scene writer also done pretti good job come creat univers gigant corpor essenti run thing uncheck government agenc corpor armi run roughshod anyth anyon get way given current state affair planet earth that believ scenario seri fall littl short howev come continu narr wont discus

As a child, the man who would become George VI, expected his older brother to sit on the throne.  He shrinks from leadership and develops a stammer.  Unable to perform royal responsibilities, he seeks treatment from the best doctors, to no avail.  Eventually, his wife finds an unorthodox speech therapist who is convinced that the problem is psychological.  But kings don't have troubles and if they do, they don't tell them to commoners.  The film is about the relationship between kind and therapist and about the power of therapy, even for kings.  Since George VI (with his Prime Minister, Churchill, of course) was able to provide the leadership that sustained England during WW II, the suggestion here is that therapy saved the western world.",1528156800,4,even king problem seem live high expect famili abus sometim must reli subject common child man would becom georg vi expect older brother sit throne shrink leadership develop stammer unabl perform royal respons seek treatment best doctor avail eventu wife find unorthodox speech therapist convinc problem psycholog king dont troubl dont tell common film relationship kind therapist power therapi even king sinc georg vi prime minist churchil cours abl provid leadership sustain england ww ii suggest therapi save western world

Last year, I tried to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godspell/dp/B003PWZDF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godspell</a>&nbsp;again, and ended up turning it off long before the end.  This movie I watched to the end, but spent much time laughing and cringing.  While its not a comedy, its certainly laughable and cringeworthy.  It actually starts off really well, though, if you basically disregard the main characters.  They are fleeing China during a revolution in the 1930s, and are hijacked for unknown reasons; leaving them crashed in the snow in the Himalayas, and eventually being rescued by a group of men from a land called Shangri-La.  The end of the movie also is not bad, if, once again, you basically disregard the main characters.

Its what happens in-between the beginning and the end of the movie that is so laughable. Many claim its the soundtrack that killed the movie, but I would argue its actually the soundtrack that makes the movie watchable and memorable . . . well, as memorable as this movie can possibly be.  Not all the songs, mind you, but some are quite good.  What killed the movie was the mismatched cast and all the ludicrous dancing. Peter Finch, too, does not come across like a man who is tired of the outside world, a man who is tired of the sound of guns pounding in his ears.  He comes across like a man whos not really fazed by anything, and thinks a place like Shangri-La is a terribly nice idea.  Sometimes he also comes across like Captain von Trapp.  Moreover, other times he looks like a man who belongs in a 1950s or 60s western.  Who dressed those people and why?

And why did I so love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-Horizon/dp/B01A1LLNBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost Horizon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godspell/dp/B003PWZDF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godspell</a>&nbsp;as a teenager?

49037,2262,5285,"I've always enjoyed Lance Henriksen in sci-fi and space fantasy and horror flicks over the decades, but I can't rally behind this film.  It's incredibly slow and not very imaginative, revisiting science fiction notions of time travel, causality, alternate timelines and Fate that were original and thought-provoking 60 years ago, but that seem banal and boring today.

A young psychotherapist is jolted by a final session with an elderly patient who not only claims he's from the future, but who claims he personally destroyed human civilization in the future through the invention of a time portal.  Apparently, this enigmatic old guy has nobly traveled back in time to avert the decline of humanity.

Aaaaand, you guessed it, the elderly patient actually IS the young psychotherapist, trying to warn himself away from time-related experimentation.  Hey, it's not a spoiler if you can already predict the entire plot (including its ""surprise ending"") only 20 minutes into the film, okay?

As mentioned, I can always appreciate Lance Henriksen, with his expressive features and low-key acting style, in any role; but this mopey, dialogue-driven fantasy drama (devoid of special effects, by the way) is like an overly-talkative ""My Dinner with Ray Bradbury,"" featuring a lengthy and superficial discussion on the dangers of tampering with the space-time continuum.

Frankly, this long-winded cautionary tale feels like it was written by a 13-year-old in a creative writing class...and I think it was.  But at least it's pleasant to hear Henriksen's voice droning on, even though he actually says nothing.",1528243200,2,ive alway enjoy lanc henriksen scifi space fantasi horror flick decad cant ralli behind film incred slow imagin revisit scienc fiction notion time travel causal altern timelin fate origin thoughtprovok 60 year ago seem banal bore today young psychotherapist jolt final session elderli patient claim he futur claim person destroy human civil futur invent time portal appar enigmat old guy nobli travel back time avert declin human aaaaand guess elderli patient actual young psychotherapist tri warn away timerel experiment hey spoiler alreadi predict entir plot includ surpris end 20 minut film okay mention alway appreci lanc henriksen express featur lowkey act style role mopey dialoguedriven fantasi drama devoid special effect way like overlytalk dinner ray bradburi featur lengthi superfici discus danger tamper spacetim continuum frankli longwind cautionari tale feel like written 13yearold creativ write classand think least pleasant hear henriksen voic drone even though actual say noth

49064,2138,2508,"I went into this film really wanting to like it, being a lifelong fan of classical music, and a fan of Philip Seymour Hoffmann to boot. But I just could not warm up to what seemed too often to be a tawdry soap opera-esque art house flick that never took off. This movie could have been great, but it fell way too short. But it still has it's moments.
  To start, it's about a famous string quartet, Hoffmann, Mark Ivanir, Catherine Keener and the one and only Christopher Walken. Now Chris may have been an odd choice to play the cellist who suffers from Parkinson's disease, and I never could get out of my head the idea that this could have been an unused SNL skit from years ago. There's even a scene when Walken learns he has the dreaded disease and does his famous ""Wow! Wow!"", from The Continental. Plus a shot of him on a treadmill hooked to some form of apparatus only made me laugh, when I knew laughter was not wanted. Walken is a brilliant actor, but maybe this was a bad bit of miscasting. Perhaps John Lithgow instead?
  Also, the quartet is threatened when PSH and Mark Ivanir refuse to switch first and second violins in an effort to keep the group going on a fresh and new level. It may have worked for R.E.M. way back when but not here. And Catherine Keener finds out that PSH is cheating on her with another woman (gratuitous sex scene included that wouldn't have been out of place on Mozart in the Jungle, which this film often reminded me of). And then Keener's daughter, played by the lovely Imogen Poots, takes up with Ivanir and creates more tension. Next thing you know, it's The Beatles in 1969. Basically the only thing that saves them is their bond for each other as people and the music they play, namely Beethoven's 13th quartet which is featured prominently. But I never ended up caring for these people, and felt a bit akward watching this, which bordered on the tawdry far too often.
  But as I said it still had it's moments. Hoffmann, who was taken from us far too soon, proves that he could shine in a subpar film on almost any day of the week. His scenes with Keener are very good. Chris Walken has one great scene in which he relates an anecdote about Pablo Casals to his students that is very funny and probably the best thing in the movie. And Imogen Poots is lovely and luminous, with beautiful big eyes that remind me of Amanda Seyfried. Plus genuine acting talent to boot, but just not here. If she were to get the right role, don't be suprised to see an Oscar nomination come her way one day. The 4 actors do make the concert scenes seem authentic, you may even be fooled into thinking that they are playing Beethoven themselves. But it's not enough. And I hated the cameo from Anne Sofie von Otter as Walken's late wife in a flashback scene, complete with a Korngold aria. You know this was just a shameless plug for the soundtrack or the latest album from ASvO. I wouldn't be surprised if the cameos from Hillary Hahn, Daniel Barenboim and Lang Lang were left on the cutting room floor in order to make room for more ""who's sleeping with who"" dramarama.
  I really look forward to a nice, intelligent film about classical music (in some form) to be released one day. Right now we only have Mozart in the Jungle stuff, which is nothing more than high-art-concept Empire or Nashville. I guess the idea that classical music people can do the backstabbing, sleeping around, nighttime soap opera stuff as good as the FAR more popular music genres is all that carries weight right now. A Late Quartet is a film that carries little weight, but it could have if it took time to ""explore the space"".------------PEACE",1528243200,2,went film realli want like lifelong fan classic music fan philip seymour hoffmann boot could warm seem often tawdri soap operaesqu art hous flick never took movi could great fell way short still moment start famou string quartet hoffmann mark ivanir catherin keener one christoph walken chri may odd choic play cellist suffer parkinson diseas never could get head idea could unus snl skit year ago there even scene walken learn dread diseas famou wow wow continent plu shot treadmil hook form apparatu made laugh knew laughter want walken brilliant actor mayb bad bit miscast perhap john lithgow instead also quartet threaten psh mark ivanir refus switch first second violin effort keep group go fresh new level may work rem way back catherin keener find psh cheat anoth woman gratuit sex scene includ wouldnt place mozart jungl film often remind keener daughter play love imogen poot take ivanir creat tension next thing know beatl 1969

49082,5085,3380,"DC keeps making great superhero movies.  This particular series, focusing heavily of Damian Wayne's Robin is super.  Robin in particular is just about perfect in all aspects, character, animation and voice acting.  The story line is pretty good and mostly true to the comics.  It is definitely not a kids movie, with some very violent moments.
The negatives in this movie are Batman and Nightwing.  They aren't bad, but not really true to their essence.  Batman is portrayed as pretty slender, youngish man with an oddly bull-terrier like face.  Seriously, what's up with the close set ice.  His extremely gruff demeanor with Robin makes a lot of sense though.
Nightwing is very underutilized and is a throwaway character.  In other movies in this series, he is portrayed as one of the best fighters in the league, very close to Batman in ability, as he is in the comics.  But just about anyone beats him in this movie.  Robin and Nightwing are matched up fairly well, but a 30 year old Robin is beaten unconscious by a 10 year old Robin?
He is particularly purely used in his fight with Talon.  He poses no threat at all, and is beaten extremely easily.  Batman pretty much owns Talon, however, as does Robin.  I'd rather they didn't use Dick Grason at all, instead of making him an expandable comic relief",1528243200,4,dc keep make great superhero movi particular seri focus heavili damian wayn robin super robin particular perfect aspect charact anim voic act stori line pretti good mostli true comic definit kid movi violent moment neg movi batman nightw arent bad realli true essenc batman portray pretti slender youngish man oddli bullterri like face serious what close set ice extrem gruff demeanor robin make lot sen though nightw underutil throwaway charact movi seri portray one best fighter leagu close batman abil comic anyon beat movi robin nightw match fairli well 30 year old robin beaten unconsci 10 year old robin particularli pure use fight talon pose threat beaten extrem easili batman pretti much own talon howev robin id rather didnt use dick grason instead make expand comic relief

49165,670,5717,"Pretty much anything surrounding the ""Virginia Woolf"" period and you can guarantee an underlying despair. It's too bad that heartbreak and its constant need for a lustful release is what we have to deal with here. That and the world of artistic license and what we know of the intellectual mores of these people at a time when their world insisted on one kind of modern progress -- or dying in so called dismal mediocrity. They created their own vain Bohemia and I think even their own children began to see it. I wonder whose idea it was for their children to call them by first names, ""Nessa"" instead of ""mother.

49189,2525,5698,"First, to distinguish and identify the film,  this is the 2015 remake, this screenplay written by Adrian Hodges, adapted from the same 1953 novel by LP Hartley.  Leo, the protagonist, is first seen as an elderly version of himself (Jim Broadbent), with a pained expression, picturing his young self seated across from him.  Young Leo (Jack Hollington), is invited by his upper-crust schoolmate to spend a holiday on his family estate. The schoolmate suddenly quarantined, Leo is immediately expensively suited-up and enthusiastically entertained by the older sister Marian (Joanna Vanderham).  She has an agenda, and all the attention is a ruse.  Shes having an affair with Ted (Ben Batt), a tenant farmer, and Leo is manipulated into carrying secret notes between them.  Marians mean mom (Lesley Manville) demands she marry Hugh ( Stephen Campbell Moore) for reasons of class and money.  Leo, an adorable and kind, sad-eyed, diminutive, almost-13-year-old, whose father died, is very vulnerable.  Nervous, but more fearful of losing favor, he reluctantly accedes. The consequences will be enormous. The piece is well-done, solidly acted (Jack Hollington is fabulous), beautifully filmed (Felix Wiedemann), edited (Stuart Gazzard), directed (Pete Travis) , scored (Christian Henson)- all of it top-notch.  But theres so much dialogue about this affair, with virtually no representation of it.  To be clear, the piece screams for, at least, a modicum of sex, lust, even sensuality.  But the really powerful overarching theme of the damaging and long-lasting effects of deception and exploitation, makes Leos story a compelling one.",1528329600,4,first distinguish identifi film 2015 remak screenplay written adrian hodg adapt 1953 novel lp hartley leo protagonist first seen elderli version jim broadbent pain express pictur young self seat across young leo jack hollington invit uppercrust schoolmat spend holiday famili estat schoolmat suddenli quarantin leo immedi expens suitedup enthusiast entertain older sister marian joanna vanderham agenda attent ruse she affair ted ben batt tenant farmer leo manipul carri secret note marian mean mom lesley manvil demand marri hugh stephen campbel moor reason class money leo ador kind sadey diminut almost13yearold whose father die vulner nervou fear lose favor reluctantli acced consequ enorm piec welldon solidli act jack hollington fabul beauti film felix wiedemann edit stuart gazzard direct pete travi score christian henson topnotch there much dialogu affair virtual represent clear piec scream least modicum sex lust even sensual realli power overarch theme damag longlast effect decept exploit make leo stori compel one

We have an early-20th Century boy who can time travel to the 19th Century (or is he a ghost or are they ghosts? Who knows Who cares?)

It takes the occasion to twist minds by representing a young escaped African slave boy as the pinnacle of morality, goodness, bravery, and charm. Just totally superior to every single other person in this film. Especially white males. See?

He talks like an American-accented, modern street kid, where in reality he would have had a British accent, being a denizen of 18th Century Virginia, lately a British colony.

An impassioned speech by his captain-adopted, white dad about slavery, ignoring that it was the British themselves who bought, sold, and used slaves in America.

Kids, this is how they twist your brain and wash it and paint it with the colors they allow you to have inside. They make you see what they want you to see. Thats the film industry. Its what they do.

Anyway the film stinksexcept for the part where they manage to work in some soft porn as the young, nubile girl is silhouetted in her sheer negligee against candle light and they let you see she is really hot underneath her clothingboobs, hips, and All.

They seem to always work in their sickness and porn.

The premise(s) is/are stupid and annoying. Totally lackluster performances by allawful actingas if they are asking, What am I doing here? One of the physically ugliest cast ensembles ever glommed together. Especially the grandmother matron.

Indeed.

It was pretty standard fare on the order of a SyFy channel movie or thereabouts. I can see updating Carter to a modern soldier since many people are unfamiliar with the Civil War these days. I can easily see Hollywood being too craven to cast a Confederate Army officer in the role of hero in the Age of Political Correctness as well, and they probably didn't have nearly enough money to fill in all the book's events and scenery to fill up 90 minutes.

49292,102,5154,"RELEASED IN 1983 and directed by Hal Needham, ""Cannonball Run II"" is a car chase comedy about a second Cannonball Run race from the West Coast to the East Coast. The teams include JJ & Victor (Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise), Blake and Fenderbaum (Dean Martin & Sammy Davis Jr.) with other teams involving Jackie Chan & Richard Kiel in a submersible Mitsubishi Starion and Mel Tillis & Tony Danza accompanied by an orangutan. There are at least a dozen other notable co-stars in various roles: Jamie Farr, Telly Savalas, Sid Caesar, Tim Conway, Foster Brooks, Ricardo Montalban , Charles Nelson Reilly, Don Knotts, etc.

This is a fun turn-off-your-brain flick with an incredible all-star cast thats worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, the script needed a rewrite with better jokes but the producers obviously didn't want to blow the money. As it is, too much of the humor falls flat, but Cannonball Run II is still leagues better than comparable junk like Smokey and the Bandit Part 3 (1983). And theres a worthwhile sequence where Dom does an amusing Brando impersonation.

Moreover, the movie scores good marks on the female front with Catherine Bach jaw-dropping in form-fitting blue spandex during the first half, teamed with her Amazonian-ish partner Susan Anton (whos no slouch in the beauty department). Bach's buttocks looks like it was sculptured by God Himself. In addition, theres Marilu Henner and Shirley MacLaine, who catch a ride with JJ & Victor, masquerading as nuns before revealing their real identities. Maclaine was 48 during shooting but still had a great figure.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot in Nevada (Las Vegas, Henderson), Arizona (Tucson, Bisbee) and California (Redondo Beach).

The entangling alliances and spread of international rivalries caused by long simmering personal conflicts, leader after leader sharing family connections through the United Kingdom's Queen Victoria, wound up tearing apart the lives of millions. This fascinating documentary takes a detailed look at the complex, often contradictory lives of Europe's royal families up to and during the war.

It's hard to deny how much family squabbling wound up making things far, far worse than they'd otherwise have been, even with the jockeying for political power typical of the age. The only real flaw is that the film focuses a great deal on the psychoanalysis of various figures, particularly that of the partially disabled Kaiser and his issues, to the expense of looking at other factors.

49364,7300,2604,"I generally liked this film. There were some very touching moments -- and some very realistic (brutally) moments. The kid dealing with homophobia and parental rejection; the college students dealing with the closet as an impediment to a relationship; the 30-something year old couple dealing with infidelity; and the older man lusting the young man. Of all the stories, the older man was the most farcical. He was a caricature, and the rushed ""happy"" ending for him was very contrived and unrealistic. The other stories involved rushed happy endings as well -- except for the 30-something couple. Despite these flaws, I found it very entertaining. PS: Antonio Velasquez is one of the finest men ever.

As the story draws on, we find out - along with how greed, spite, lust, and righteousness can ruin another's life.

49396,2663,3772,"Based on an historical novel of the same title by Meaghan Wilson-Anastasios and Andrew Anastasios, this superb drama tells the highly fictionalized story of Joshua Connor, an Australian outback farmer whose three sons (according to this story) all went into the battle at Gallipoli and were reported to have died on the same day.

Four years later, his wife can no longer stand their absence and the fact that none of them are coming home and apparently walks into a pond and drowns herself. Before doing so, however, she asks her husband to go to Turkey and find their remains and bring her boys home.

With nothing less to lose, Connor boards a steamship for Istanbul and upon arrival finds himself unwelcome and rebuffed at every turn.

Not to be dissuaded or discouraged, however, he hires a fisherman to transport him to Gallipoli and there proceeds to do the seemingly impossible.

This film offers beautiful cinematography alongside a lovely screenplay full of hope and strength of character.

It is fiction of course. But it does at least hint (for those previously uninformed) at the horrors of the 10 month campaign at Gallipoli. The film speaks of 70,000 Turks lost and 10,000 Britains. In fact, Britain lost 161,000 dead and more than 90,000 sick and injured evacuees; Turkey's sole victory of World War I cost that nation roughly 250,000 dead.

Still, the film is not an encyclopedia. It is art. And as such, it is very fine indeed.",1528588800,5,base histor novel titl meaghan wilsonanastasio andrew anastasio superb drama tell highli fiction stori joshua connor australian outback farmer whose three son accord stori went battl gallipoli report die day four year later wife longer stand absenc fact none come home appar walk pond drown howev ask husband go turkey find remain bring boy home noth le lose connor board steamship istanbul upon arriv find unwelcom rebuf everi turn dissuad discourag howev hire fisherman transport gallipoli proce seemingli imposs film offer beauti cinematographi alongsid love screenplay full hope strength charact fiction cours least hint previous uninform horror 10 month campaign gallipoli film speak 70000 turk lost 10000 britain fact britain lost 161000 dead 90000 sick injur evacue turkey sole victori world war cost nation roughli 250000 dead still film encyclopedia art fine inde

Sadly, it isn't until something horrific happens that people try to put the pieces together, and understand the story. And, as this movies shows, even then, we may never truly know. I get that when loss this profound happens in the world, we NEED someone to blame, we NEED answers, and more than that, we need answers WE can live with. I think sometimes it isn't so much the crime, event, or person/persons responsible in the end, it is what we need to tell ourselves and believe, so we can move on.

49454,2205,2642,"Based on another reviewer's advice I stuck with this thru the 2nd episode. Wished I hadn't. There are so many things wrong with this production I hardly know where to begin. Let's take a look at our prison system. Recent movies/series would have us believe that everyone released from the slahmmer is: muscular (very likely true), can steal a car and out race a pursuer thru mid day traffic in NYC without maiming/killing any pedestrians, then then hop on a motorcycle and make a get-away. Do we now give bike riding classes in our lock-ups. We also have to believe that the gun man chasing our ex-con can miss shooting him 20 feet away with a frontal shot.

Then we have to go along with the ex-con happening to meet a stranger that is on his way to be sworn in as the new sheriff in the town of Banshee. Fortunately for the story line this person gets killed so our ex-con can assume his identity in the town he wants to to. Talk about blind luck. He should be buying lottery tickets.

Then, at the police stations, as the ex-con is being introduced to the police staff, a feisty, female deputy hauls in a local miscreant all by her little old self. Can we guess who she will be boinking sometime in the future?

And speaking of boinking. The ex-con waists no time in finding someone to boink. Not saying that a guy that's been inside for awhile wouldn't jump the first female he encounters, but I don't need to see the details. They are nothing unusual, in today's productions and don't further the story in any way. There quickly follows other incidents of the sexual kind that are as explicit as allowed but not necessary for any reason. I'm pretty sure we all know what prostitutes do and the various ways people can have sex.

In conclusion, I don't care about any of these characters and see nothing new to learn about them. There are some good cops, some bad rich people, a few people who are trying to hide their pasts and a smattering of towns people. A native American father and son were introduced but I'm not going to stick around to find out what their purpose, if any, is in this plot.",1528588800,1,base anoth review advic stuck thru 2nd episod wish hadnt mani thing wrong product hardli know begin let take look prison system recent moviesseri would u believ everyon releas slahmmer muscular like true steal car race pursuer thru mid day traffic nyc without maimingkil pedestrian hop motorcycl make getaway give bike ride class lockup also believ gun man chase excon miss shoot 20 foot away frontal shot go along excon happen meet stranger way sworn new sheriff town banshe fortun stori line person get kill excon assum ident town want talk blind luck buy lotteri ticket polic station excon introduc polic staff feisti femal deputi haul local miscreant littl old self guess boink sometim futur speak boink excon waist time find someon boink say guy that insid awhil wouldnt jump first femal encount dont need see detail noth unusu today product dont stori way quickli follow incid sexual kind explicit allow necessari reason

The film mocks Sarah Palin and more generically conservatives. It mocks marketers. It mocks all politicians as liars. It mocks North Korea. It mocks Nazis. It mocks military leaders.

You have to be a thee right frame of mind (or perhaps absence of mind) to enjoy this senseless movie.

It is simple and a bit vaudevillian.

49488,787,5676,"Wonderfully written, directed, and acted!  A great twist on the typical murder mystery and well worth watching.  The reviewers who can object to the ultimate message of the story are showing themselves to be morally barren.  Beware possible spoilers:

The play/movie's idea isn't to unilaterally condemn the wealthy, but to show that each person's actions impact others.  We live in a world where power and social class are closely aligned with wealth and when a person is in a position of *power* they have a greater impact upon the fates of others.  That's not the same as condemning the wealthy for having money, which is something certain political groups refuse to acknowledge as a means of avoiding an honest debate about social equality.  JB Priestley was condemning those in a position of power for not using their influence to lift others up, or at least refrain from pushing them farther down to maintain their own status.  The movie makes it clear that Thewlis is intended as a righteous god, more interested in exposing each character to the others and to themselves than any kind of worldly justice.  Many of the characters, particularly the son who is the only one who would stand trial according to the father, could lie to the real inspector without getting caught.  But thanks to Thewlis they will all have to face themselves.  Even as an atheist, I didn't mind the god aspect of justice in the movie; it was a good literary device.  After all, where better to place a god than in a work of fiction.  Five stars!

No man is an island,
Entire of itself,
Every man is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thy friend's
Or of thine own were:
Any man's death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind,
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
It tolls for thee.

49499,670,5698,"A worthy film and story. The ways in which these 2 different classes used the boy, with at times, no real regard for his feelings was sad. Through reckless maneuverings, he was being exploited and neither especially the woman failed to see the emotional toll it was having on him. He was a sensitive and intelligent child on the edge of puberty and trying to figure out things in the adult world, at a time when propriety and class was at a premium. He began to see the disaster that lay ahead and tried to keep it from happening. Sadly, at a time when women of this class were very much controlled by their ability to attract the right marriage.,risking it all was always a dangerous option. Really the only decent person in this movie is actually the man who wanted to marry her in the first place. She deserved far less for what she did, not so much in falling in love with someone else, but of thinking of nobody else but herself.. Her own mother was an iron lady who didn't help the situation and treated her grown children with little regard for their emotions...but again, during this time, it was expected that a young woman of this class and status would do their part toward keeping the families respectability. The long term outcome all of it had on the little messenger, the go between, the visiting child - had far reaching impact. Very sad, but in the end...we see the child (now, Jim Broadbent) all grown up, a man, and ""Marian""...elderly Lynn Redgrave, a beauty, if there ever was one. The word ""spooning"" comes up a lot in the film.

Red Dawn is a fun, but overly long war film. It takes on the 1980's style camp tone with one note communist villains. You are engaged by Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey, but no one else. However, Harry Dean Stanton delivers a neat monologue towards the beginning. Red Dawn tries too hard to be democratic and ends up feeling like propaganda.

Red Dawn is worth a single watch for that fun and creative '80's vibe wherein children can take on the entire Russian army. If you can suspend your disbelief, you'll have a good time. Otherwise, it becomes tedious and unbelievable with each new situation. At least, there are consequences eventually.

As an 81 year old codger, he has given me hope that I can retain my ability to learn and to do good things for the rest of my life.

Although their are Dirty Harry aspects to the hero, in fact he is much more complex than Harry, really not at all like him once you get past the tough guy image Eastwood portrays so deeply.

As the priest says, this movie will teach you a great deal about life and death and a little bit about Hmong culture.

49586,2179,4627,"I love this show. It has lots of action, the supporting characters are super strong, and the human elements are solid. I love the character development and the way new characters are introduced. The cast of this show is probably the best of any on TV right now.

The show has a few negative elements, though they're relatively minor. Most are typical, in that they fail to portray real life accurately:

1. Some people may be irritated by the tiny masks that the characters wear, which really don't hide their identities at all. But that's a typical comic book setup and doesn't bother me at all.

2. The characters often hide secrets from each other even though in real life they would likely reveal those secrets to those who are really closest to them. Again, understandable as a plot device, but the writers sure seem to use this a lot. Almost to the point of sitcom-like dependence.

3. Some situations show no research by the writers at all. For instance, in one scene, a doctor starts rattling off medical history about Sara to her sister, Laurel, before Laurel visits her at the hospital. In real life, no doctor would do this due to confidentiality laws. It's done in especially sloppily on the show, because Laurel could have noted the same medical conditions by just seeing her sister with her shirt off (which she does in the same scene).

4. Another huge gaffe is when a supervillain takes control of Queen Consolidated. Even though the Queens own 50% of this multibillion dollar corporation, the takeover supervillain somehow manages to ""dilute"" all of the Queens' holdings to the point that they're basically worthless. Everything about the takeover, the ownership thereafter, and the dilution makes no sense, even to a high school business student. Further, it never made sense that Oliver Queen kept hanging around at the company rather than just selling everything to the takeover artist when he didn't know that she was a supervillain. And did the Queens have the worst estate-planning advice ever in the history of rich people? What, now they're broke? They don't have trust funds? The entire fortune is tied up in 50% of the stock of a Fortune 500 company rather than being diversified even a tiny little bit? They don't sell stock over time and put the cash into trust funds in unrelated assets? This is not at all like real life.

But if you can get past some of the silly fails in business and legal knowledge shown by the writers (I did), this show is quite good.",1528761600,4,love show lot action support charact super strong human element solid love charact develop way new charact introduc cast show probabl best tv right show neg element though theyr rel minor typic fail portray real life accur 1 peopl may irrit tini mask charact wear realli dont hide ident that typic comic book setup doesnt bother 2 charact often hide secret even though real life would like reveal secret realli closest understand plot devic writer sure seem use lot almost point sitcomlik depend 3 situat show research writer instanc one scene doctor start rattl medic histori sara sister laurel laurel visit hospit real life doctor would due confidenti law done especi sloppili show laurel could note medic condit see sister shirt scene 4 anoth huge gaff supervillain take control queen consolid even though queen 50 multibillion dollar corpor takeov supervillain somehow manag dilut queen hold point theyr basic worthless everyth takeov ownership thereaft dilut make sen even high school busi

I didn't realize until after the movie ended and I research it further that it is the movie that was panned by many people as being unrealistic, propaganda, and exaggerating or changing details of events. The funny thing is, the ""revised"" version of events that I've read in various places does not seem truthful at all. This movie, on the other hand, does. The incompetence of desk personnel and their coverups of that incompetence are laid bare in this film, and though it's sad to see such idiocy at such high levels, anyone who lives in the real world should expect that.

Enough editorializing about the general state of stupidity. This movie manages to humanize the men in it. They are shown with their weaknesses and strengths equally exposed. People sometimes forget that just because some guy is a badass in battle, does not by default mean that he's a one-dimensional idiot. This movie does a good job of showing all aspects of these men's lives. It also exemplifies how messy the world really is, especially in times of war and conflict.

49638,1441,5249,"If Meghan Markle weren't starring in this movie, I would've skipped it. When Sparks Fly is a Hallmark joint from 2014, and it's not one of the best ones. Even with Meghan in it. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

Some spoilers.

Meghan is Amy Peterson, an aspiring journalist who grew up in Lakeside, Washington. Seven years ago, in Lakeside, during the 4th of July celebration, Amy's boyfriend, Hank, was about to propose except she beat him to the punch with her own thunderbolt news, that instead of interning with the nearby Seattle Observer, she's accepted a job with the Chicago Post. Hank, poor soul, ended up tucking away that ring.

Seven years later, we hook up again with Amy who is still in Chicago and still with the Post. But the luster's gone. She hasn't been stoked about her job in a while now. And she's not simpatico with her current man, Phil (the toothy Lochlyn Munro). Phil is a sophisticated world traveler who eats fancy dishes where Amy would rather enjoy a burger.

Uh-oh, circulation is down for the Post, and the editor can't emphasize enough the need for relatable human interest stories so as to drum up business.

With the 4th of July holiday looming, Amy happens to mention that her parents operate a fireworks business. Her editor smells a story and promptly assigns her to write a piece about her family and her family business. So, there's Amy heading back home to Washington, not only to write her article but, also, because her best friend Sammie (Kristina Pesic) is getting married and Amy's the maid of honor.

But Amy is in for a shock. Sammie is marrying Amy's ex, Hank. Sammie was nervous divulging this bit of news, but Amy takes it well. It's been seven years, after all. Now, me, it was right around there that I started judging the movie. What kind of bestie would keep it in the dark that she's dating - let alone, marrying - your old flame?

One day Hallmark will present a whole new sack of tropes, but that day's not today. When Sparks Fly rolls out the same predictable elements. Yes, there is some sort of holiday event going on. Yes, there is an ex that was left behind. Yes, the current boyfriend will drop in to escalate the tension and generally make things awkward. And, yes, the family business is in trouble. Amy comes home to hugs and kisses from her parents, but it's up to her to figure out that Peterson Pyrotechnics is not doing so well. But, hey, at least, the water main won't break and the city council won't have to call an emergency meeting and cancel the 4th of July celebration so that the city's funds can be reallocated to repair that busted water main...

What is up with Sammie? I normally like bubbly side characters but Sammie is insanely over-the-top. She is a bridezilla and then some. Her taste runs towards the bold - some would say garish. She opts for a 4th of July wedding theme, and there's nothing that says subtle about that. Sammie's already gone thru two wedding planners, and it's looking like there's about to be a third victim, especially when Marie, the latest wedding planner, counsels her to tone down her ""pops of patriotism."" And there's Amy trying to be a good friend, but maybe she should've been the plain-speaking friend and just told her the truth, that Sammie's notion of an in-your-face 4th of July themed wedding is tacky as all hell.

I wish I cared more about the romantic bits. I don't. Christopher Jacot plays Amy's ex, Hank Lyons, and he's boring. Hank is an attorney-at-law, except I can't see him in court swaying a jury. Hank makes vanilla bored. Anyway, no surprise, Amy and Hank run into each other a bunch of times and feelings that were dormant for seven years get all stirred up. Whatever.

The movie does offer up one pleasant surprise. Amy's current boyfriend, Phil, ends up being a good guy from start to finish. It's nice that, for once, the big city slicker doesn't show up at their significant other's little hometown and snidely makes fun of things. And maybe the best thing that happens in this movie is the very graceful way Phil exits. But then they ruin it by having him come back.

The last 10 minutes of the movie is a masterclass in how to leave a bad taste in the viewer's mouth. It's not a good look that they don't even wait long enough for the dust to settle, and for Sammie to get over her grief, and for Phil to get over his, before Hank proposes to Amy and Amy giddily accepts. And it bugs me that a lively career woman would suddenly resign so that she could stay home and do what? Start a new job marketing her parents' fireworks business? Seems to me Amy sacrifices a lot but Hank doesn't lose anything. Meghan Markle reportedly was so dismayed with When Sparks Fly that, right then and there, she vowed to marry a prince so that she doesn't have to anymore get stuck doing stupid movies like this one. But I may have made up that last bit.

49640,1608,5650,"Marcella season one introduced us toAnba Friel who plays Marcella a tortured detective. It is at times difficult to know who the murderers are and who are the police. I have never seen someone as messed up, with such problems as Marcella. The closing episode does not leave us much room for hope or redemption.

Season 2 of Marcella is the most depressing and dark series I have seen. Marcella is trying to get to the bottom of her dark days where she lashes out and hurts. Her husband has left her, she shares custody of the children with her ex husband, and that is not going well. Work is all Marcella has, and the investigation she is involved with is more depressing than her life. Children are abducted and killed. How much more can we take, well I will tell you, this series is more than I can take. I had to fast forward through some scenes, and the closing is not good, not at all.

49643,7401,4385,"THE WONDER YEARS: Easily the best show about nostalgia since Leave It to Beaver (which of course only became nostalgic in reruns), The Wonder Years chronicled the life and times of late sixties kid Kevin Arnold, played to wide eyed perfection by Fred Savage. Punctuated by the era's pop classics and Daniel Stern's warm voiceovers, Kevin dealt with a no nonsense Dad, doting Mom, free spirit sister, despicable older brother, and his best friends, geeky Paul and crush-worthy Winnie Cooper. Plot lines in the laugh track-free series walked a tightrope between hilarious and serious, making liberal use of flashbacks and fantasy sequences, with stellar acting by every cast member. Nothing quite like The Wonder Years had ever graced television before its 1988 debut...there's been nothing like it in the three decades since.

So nice to see the Canadians are just as shallow.  The Russian of course plays chess, can execute a perfect pirouette, and subsists on vodka and caviar.  The cleaner is of course hispanic and has 6 kids and 1 grandkid (while looking only 35).  All the men are dumb and bumbling.  All the women are fawn over the Russian no matter how rude he is.  The head of security is a gruff antagonist, but even he goes soft on the guy.  And of course the camera shakes when they're in his security office to remind us of NYPD Blue or something.  Lines are spoken as if they read them off a card.  There isn't even an attempt at acting here.  The interior shots of the hotel are really stylish at least.  Production values are high (hey, when you don't have to pay writers, you can spend a lot on production!).  Fun if you're not looking for anything challenging.  All happy endings.

49659,2525,3863,"An exciting film, uplifting, as it follows an unlikely twosome mastering adversity.  A mostly-drunk, acting-out Dan (Mark Ruffalo), whos pretty much exploded his career, hears the song and guitar of Gretta (Keira Knightley), a half-hiding performer in a dimly-lit bar.  He imagines, and its wonderfully depicted, a fantasy orchestra accompanying her. Hes got to record her. Shes on the verge of being dumped by Dave (Adam Levine), her ostensible soul mate and partner in songwriting, as he advances from performer to superstar, with all the attendant female swooning. Much of the film focuses on the exciting collaboration of Gretta and Dan as they collect diverse musicians along the way, record in subways, on rooftops, and all sorts of unheralded natural venues   NYC, en plein air sometimes fleeing just ahead of the cops or bribing kids to either stay quiet or join in.  The ambient sound becomes part of the music . Relationships, both failed and hopeful, are naturally explored, with little fanfare.  The themes of honesty, loyalty, and fairness, are taken seriously.  Resilience is modeled.  The music is superpunk meets pop.  James Cordens performance is outstanding.  James Carney does an impressive job as writer/director, as do Gregg Alexander,music; Yaron Orbach, cinematography; and Andrew Marcus, editing.

49682,102,176,"RELEASED IN 2012 and written/directed by Rob Zombie, ""The Lords of Salem"" is a witchcraft/horror flick starring Sheri Moon Zombie as a DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, who is sent a wooden box containing a mysterious record dubbed ""gift from the Lords. The creepy music thereof triggers flashbacks of her town's infamous past. Is Heidi going crazy or are the witches taking revenge on Salem?

The ambiance, mood, directing, music, locations, sets and cast are all top notch, showing that Zombie has developed into a quality director since his first shot eleven years earlier with House of 1000 Corpses, which was shot in 2000. This is serious haunting horror as opposed to the campy black comedy of 1000 Corpses (not that theres anything wrong with that, lol). The movie mixes elements from ""The City of the Dead, aka ""Horror Hotel"" (1960), Suspiria (1977), Rosemarys Baby (1968), The Wicker Man (1973) and To the Devil a Daughter (1976). If you like any of these movies, The Lords of Salem is as good or better.

Usually when you see old hag witches in movies its kinda eye-rolling; not so here. Rob gives us the real deal and its not pretty, although I admit to busting out laughing every time the witches hailed Satan. Speaking of which, modern Wiccans won't like how the films mixes Witchcraft with Satanism (the truth hurts). Interestingly, theres almost as much Christian imagery as there is Satanic.

One things for sure, Zombie doesnt paint witchcraft/Satanism in a positive light. Its similar to The Witch (2015) in this respect, where converting to witch-dom meant becoming a baby-slaughtering, blood-bathing, family-destroying, goat-sucking, friggin pedophile hag with the illusion of youth. When the Devil eventually appears in Lords, its anything but a positive image.

The story seems to perpetuate the myth that those condemned at the Salem Witch Trials in 1692-1693 were burned to death. Actually, 19 people were hung, another slowly crushed to death, and over 150 imprisoned.

Sheri makes for a strong protagonist, but shes the extant of any eye candy on the female front. As noted earlier, the witches are all hideous hags and look even uglier with their clothes off. Meg Foster surprisingly appears as the lead witch. Meanwhile, Judy Geeson, Patricia Quinn and Dee Wallace are on hand as a dubious trio in modern Salem. Speaking of whom, they have a great (hilarious) tea scene with Bruce Davison, who plays an expert on witchcraft.

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 41 minutes and was shot in Salem, Massachusetts; Sable Ranch, Santa Clarita, California (witches dancing around fire); and the Los Angeles Theatre (opera house).

Sadly if you want the complete Arrancar arc, you will have to purchase this set for the last few episodes on here. I'm sure Viz cut the DVD's the way they did so that there was canon in every set. Because I can guarantee they would have lost a lot of revenue from people refusing to buy the filler arc sets.

We see Jon Snow come into his own. Little Finger is causing trouble as always.

Cersei has her most successful and malevolent triumphs to date, and oddly, you will find yourself rooting for her at times.

The Ironborn divide into factions, and everyone's favorite, Tyrion, rises to an appropriate and fun position.

The CGI is masterfully done, and the big battle scenes are simply amazing.

What pushes this boxed set over the top is the wonderful extras!

I loved the look behind the scenes.  It is stunning just how many people are involved in the production of Game of Thrones.

Just to close the loop, the TV Series has entirely left the GRRM book plots at this point.  There were some lingering scenes that intersected with the last published book, Dances with Dragons, and very few of the scenes and plot-lines followed the book.  So, when GRRM does finally complete the last book, it will be the conclusion to an entirely different series.

49876,4346,5597,"""DCI Banks"" is a well-done BBC police procedural, featuring DCI Alan Banks as the head of an investigative team in Yorkshire.  Banks as played here by Stephen Tompkinson is a good cop, blessed with a dogged persistence in his work, but sometimes all too human in his reactions to criminals and victims.  His counterpart in the series is Andrea Lowe as DS Anne Cabbot, good-looking and very ambitious, whose intriguing relationship with Banks is part of the interest of the series.  Season One presents four two-part murder mysteries, chock-full of suspects and clues.  The series is terrific for binge-watching and viewers may be challenged to solve the cases ahead of the detectives.  Highly recommended and highly addictive.",1529107200,5,dci bank welldon bbc polic procedur featur dci alan bank head investig team yorkshir bank play stephen tompkinson good cop bless dog persist work sometim human reaction crimin victim counterpart seri andrea low d ann cabbot goodlook ambiti whose intrigu relationship bank part interest seri season one present four twopart murder mysteri chockful suspect clue seri terrif bingewatch viewer may challeng solv case ahead detect highli recommend highli addict

49899,102,447,"RELEASED IN 2013 and directed by John Moore, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" is the Third of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Moscow to aid his unruly son, Jack (Jai Courtney), only to discover that Jack is an undercover agent. Father & son team-up to stop a nuclear weapons heist. Sebastian Koch is on hand as a focal point in the heist.

The Die Hard flicks fill the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean ""dumb"" in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond ""genuinely good people may be flawed and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil."" Thankfully, this installment throws in some entertaining father/son character development in between the wild action sequences. McClanes daughter also appears for good measure (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).

The story isn't quite as engaging as ""Live Free or Die Hard"" (2007), but it was good enough and the action scenes are out of this world, including a long vehicle chase in Moscow in the opening act. Director Moore ups the ante with quick-editing for this one. Some parts are eye-rolling absurd, but everything's done with a quasi-realistic tone, which sorta helps the viewer go along with the ridiculousness rather than tune out.

The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's ""The Gauntlet"" where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns."" Thankfully, ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" pretty much evades that ditch by giving us entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story. Speaking of the story, one of the highlights is the infamous Russian location of the final act. Another highlight is hottie raven-haired Yuliya Snigir.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 38 minutes and was shot in Budapest, Hungary, with the Chernobyl scenes done at Old Soviet Air Force Base, Kiskunlachza, Hungary, along with establishing shots of Moscow. WRITERS: Skip Woods.

Some times many parents don't know what to do with their children and instead of helping them, they do the contrary. I consider the family should take care of  Kevin""s behaviors since he was born, even though one doctor told the mother that he hasn't AUTISM, she should consult for a second opinion. This is an excellent film where society can learn how parents deal with the emotional distress raising a child with a mental illness.( Even though the mother didn't know )
Early intervention is the best for children in any level of misbehavior . Is the parents don't do anything, how they can spectate not to have legal issues with their children in the future?

What I will say is that the plot makes little to no sense when taking into consideration the other movies.  This movie is one nonsequitor after the next, honestly you need to leave your expectations at the door with this movie and the other ""new"" star wars movies.

There are some people who enjoy it, and good for them.  Honestly I somewhat liked it but I left the movie thinking ""so much of this didn't make any sense.""  After the nostalgia wore off I realized how bad the movies really are.

There have been so many of these (no offense to any directors, but most of them in recent years have been terrible), so I almost skipped this one. But this flick actually has a believable storyline (something a little bit different from the typical, run-of-the-mill vamp theme), along with beautiful European scenery and very good special effects. The last half hour (or so) for me was when I decided that a 3-star rating should be bumped up to 4-star: it all sort of came together at that point. Overall it was good, because it was different and it didn't follow the 'same-old same-old' formula that so many movies of this genre (sadly) seem to be falling into these days. I admire writers, and actors (in this case the two lead actors also wrote the script, which was interesting) who work to push that 'let's think outside the box' concept in modern horror movies. This particular genre could certainly use some 'fresh blood', that is for sure!

and the real cheryl in the book is on set  while this movie was made,
cheryl lost her mother at a young age and  and her and her brother had no one else,
after her mother( laura dern) passed, cheryl went through the some really hard and bad times,
she was shooting drugs,  having sex with any man that would have her and other bad things,
you will see in this movie, only to decide she needed to find herself and  she decided to hike
1100  miles over the pacific crest, she  went through a lot to just make it day to day , but with
her flashbacks of her life with her mother and all the reminders and advice her mother had given her over  her years
 and being able to live those things and meet some good and bad people on the trials along the way
she was finally able to make it  and she was alive and well and  what happened to afterwards was even better,
watching this movie , may make you think of your past life and how  you could have done better  or maybe do better in the future
and you can pass this this on to your kids or whoever, but if you watch this movie, after the show itself is over
watch the credits , you will get to see  some of the pictures of the real cheryl  as she was hiking,
and  there is  the extras you always see  at the start of most movies, after the movie , go back and watch it,

Cinemablend's ""To 3D or Not"" scale ranks Gravity 35 out of 35, but their reviews are of the film seen in a theater. The only thing I can assume here is that the blu ray is different. There is nearly NO 3D in most of this movie. (LG OLED65E6P) There are a few scenes of Sandra Bullock floating through narrow corridors and debris flying toward you that offer some good 3D, but that's 5 minutes. The vast majority of the film on this blu ray appears flat. Removed my glasses several times and saw nearly no separation between images on screen. Didn't see this one in the theater, so I can only judge the blu ray.

49998,248,5672,"This period true crime mystery is based upon a beautifully written and well researched book by Kate Summerscale that details the murder investigation that surrounded an appalling murder that occurred in England in 1860. It is a fascinating true crime story, and this film does it justice.

When three-year-old Saville Kent was found murdered, his throat savagely cut in the outhouse at the home of his well-to-do parents, suspicion immediately fell upon the family and their servants, as it happened during the night, when the child was sleeping, and nothing was taken from the house. After all, who else  might've murder this innocent child? This murder outraged the public and generated much press coverage throughout England. When the incompetent local police came up empty-handed, Scotland Yard stepped in, sending their best detective, Jonathan Whicher, to spearhead the investigation.

What Whicher surmised from his investigation was that, indeed, one of the family members was responsible.  Though he eventually formally accused one of them, the evidence proved insufficient to bind the accused to trial and provoked a public outcry against Whicher, effectively ending his career. Years later, he would be vindicated by an amazing turn of events.

This period true crime drama is simply terrific, with an authenticity of time and place. The acting is excellent and, coupled with a compelling story that stays pretty true to the book upon which it is based, those who love true crime,as well as period dramas,  will be riveted. I most definitely enjoyed it!",1529193600,5,period true crime mysteri base upon beauti written well research book kate summerscal detail murder investig surround appal murder occur england 1860 fascin true crime stori film justic threeyearold savil kent found murder throat savag cut outhous home welltodo parent suspicion immedi fell upon famili servant happen night child sleep noth taken hous el mightv murder innoc child murder outrag public gener much press coverag throughout england incompet local polic came emptyhand scotland yard step send best detect jonathan whicher spearhead investig whicher surmis investig inde one famili member respons though eventu formal accus one evid prove insuffici bind accus trial provok public outcri whicher effect end career year later would vindic amaz turn event period true crime drama simpli terrif authent time place act excel coupl compel stori stay pretti true book upon base love true crimea well period drama rivet definit enjoy

after her mother( laura dern) passed, cheryl went through the some really hard and bad times,
she was shooting drugs,  having sex with any man that would have her and other bad things,
you will see in this movie, only to decide she needed to find herself and  she decided to hike
1100  miles over the pacific crest, she  went through a lot to just make it day to day , but with
her flashbacks of her life with her mother and all the reminders and advice her mother had given her over  her years
 and being able to live those things and meet some good and bad people on the trials along the way
she was finally able to make it  and she was alive and well and  what happened to afterwards was even better,

This amusing and heartwarming movie succeeds where Doctor Dolittle (1998) barely gets by. Its also more relevant to adults in light of the romantic shenanigans, albeit still family friendly. Everything hinges on whether or not the movie can pull off the animals as (talking) characters while keeping you invested in the drama. And it does, incredibly. I actually found myself caring about one of the animals in particular. As always, James makes for a likable every-guy protagonist. And Dawson is winsome.

50128,2525,5676,"In a 1912 fictional English industrial town, a well-to-do middle-aged factory owner is over-the-moon.  He excitedly anticipates his own potential knighthood and the merger of his future son-in-laws family business with his own. The maid unexpectedly announces the arrival of an Inspector Goole (curious that). Hes deadly serious, as he announces the suicide of a young woman.  And one-by-one he interrogates all members of the Birling family and the fianc, Gerald Croft, as he eerily links each with the cause of her undoing.  He speaks as if enduring the most bitter of bites. This is a clever drama, revived and reincarnated many times, since its premiere in Moscow in 1945, as a 3-act play by author J.B.Priestly. The location for its dramatic debut is not accidental, in light of the playwrights political inclination. The piece is loaded with intrigue, a hefty dose of wonderfully British melodrama, a few surprising twists and turns, and some predictable ones. Its suggestive of a latter-day morality play, with a stern reprimand for those privileged, who neglect or dishonor those in genuine need.  This 2015 version of Priestleys memorialized play is impressively adapted, directed, and acted. The mysterious Inspector Goole provides the most baffling whodunit of all, and his identity has been the subject of endless speculation for decades.

50151,345,5721,"... of the first penal colony in Australia is different, but the situations and scenarios are very likely since human nature is no different now than it was then.  To the point, there was no governor in NSW at the time.  He didn't arrive there for many years.  There was no major commanding the Royal Marines.  A Royal Navy captain set up the colony.  But as in the series, the marines were all volunteers and the ratio of soldiers to convicts is not that far off and some marines were particularly sadistic.  The floggings, hunger, chain gangs and other difficulties noted in the series were fact based as well, however, hangings were rare.
The characters, especially the main 3 are fleshed out quickly, and there is little development past that, one spending most of his time crying, and the other 2 spending their time sacrificing some part of themselves for the other, the major takes particular advantage of his position, and the reverend takes it upon himself to speak for everyone's god in all matters moral or anything else.  Some of the characters could have added some depth to the series by being further developed and other things could have been less focused upon.  Entirely too much film was dedicated to some, and not enough to others, however the directing, capability of the actors, the very well done backlighting at night, the particularly well shot studio scenes and excellent editing carried me all the way through the series.  In fact, I'd watch another season of Banished if some other production company picked it up.  All the aforementioned considered, the series is watchable, the leads need some depth and range, and a little more attention to historical detail would put the icing on for me, but then, I have a predilection for things Australian anyway.",1529452800,4,first penal coloni australia differ situat scenario like sinc human natur differ point governor nsw time didnt arriv mani year major command royal marin royal navi captain set coloni seri marin volunt ratio soldier convict far marin particularli sadist flog hunger chain gang difficulti note seri fact base well howev hang rare charact especi main 3 flesh quickli littl develop past one spend time cri 2 spend time sacrif part major take particular advantag posit reverend take upon speak everyon god matter moral anyth el charact could ad depth seri develop thing could le focus upon entir much film dedic enough other howev direct capabl actor well done backlight night particularli well shot studio scene excel edit carri way seri fact id watch anoth season banish product compani pick aforement consid seri watchabl lead need depth rang littl attent histor detail would put ice predilect

This film is not for everyone. It's low-key and moves slowly at times. I had no problem with this. But if you want a lot of action, you need to look elsewhere.

I kept thinking I knew who the killer was, but my suspicions kept bouncing all over the place. She did it; no, he did it; no, it was really that person; no, wait, it was this character over here. I was wrong on all counts.

The script is very clever and held my interest throughout. Just when I thought I knew what was going on, the story threw me a curve ball. I love that kind of thing.

If you like courtroom dramas, an engaging narrative, and don't mind a slow pace, you might want to give this movie a try.",1529452800,5,id never heard movi like keanu reev courtroom drama decid give tri film everyon lowkey move slowli time problem want lot action need look elsewher kept think knew killer suspicion kept bounc place realli person wait charact wrong count script clever held interest throughout thought knew go stori threw curv ball love kind thing like courtroom drama engag narr dont mind slow pace might want give movi tri

50189,476,1917,"Two young girls lose their parents and spend five years in an isolated cabin. Their uncle Lucas spends down to his last penny and finally finds them. The girls have gone feral so naturally they wind up in government care. They show signs of recovery. The shrink working with them wants the girls to have a stable home life to continue the improvements. Lucas is an artist and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) plays guitar in a rock band. They are not exactly model parents, especially when another aunt wants custody. The shrink recommends for Lucas and Annabel after cutting a deal where he can continue to observe the children. His practice offers them a normal suburban house to live in where they uneasily set up their new family. Too bad the supernatural entity that took care of the kids in the cabin came with them to the new home. And is jealous, very jealous, of the girls' affection.

The movie spends a lot of time and effort on the set up. Instead of making the story slow, they created interesting characters and a believable enough situation that viewers naturally want to find out what's going on and what's going to happen. The actors do a great job, making the movie more compelling and interesting throughout. It's a well-crafted and well-acted horror film.

The whole movie emphasizes atmosphere. A lot of the terror is created through the sound effects--the sounds of the ghost, the evocative music, etc. The visuals are effective because they are restrained. The spiritual entity Mama is, like the shark in Jaws, not really seen until the end. One or two of the jump scares are telegraphed too much, robbing them of shock value. Otherwise the film is very well crafted and thrilling. The gore is very minimal and probably why the movie is rated PG-13 (though it is more like 13 going on 21--not at all kid-appropriate unless your kid likes to have nightmares).

While season 2 isn't *as* strong as the first, it's still really great, and the new characters are pretty complex. In my honest opinion, I feel like the 2-part OVA Ciel in Wonderland makes this release worth the buy, but perhaps that's just because I'm a huge Alice in Wonderland fan. The other OVAs are good, too, despite the fact that they're basically fillers.

Season 2 itself is definitely a good watch. The main character opposite Ciel is the new boy Alois. He has become one of my favorite characters of all time, and his backstory is just as dark as you would expect. I like that there's a reason as to why he's so crazy and messed up, rather just being an edgy character for the heck of it. The other characters from his mansion are also pretty unique, and while Claude at first seems too similar to Sebastian, you soon find out just how different the characters are.

At the end of the day, I'm really sad that this main season only lasted 12 episodes, as the characters and story were good enough that they definitely could have added a lot more content without making it drag on. But, if you're a Black Butler fan, you absolutely need to own this.

Why rent a ""soft porn"" film and then complain about the sex in it?  Ridiculous!  That being said, yeah, this is erotica. I wouldn't call it ""porn"" - it's about sex, after all - that's kind of a big part of the story.  The story is a nice idea - woman conquers her fears in the bedroom during an exploration of some kinky stuff, and therefore learns something about her own power.  As someone who experienced something kind of similar, I totally get that.  This isn't a film about sex at all really (so people who are shrieking that it wasn't sexy enough need to just stop). It was about dealing with the difficult parts in life - like other people pushing you around and not quite knowing how to confront that - both in yourself (why do you allow it?) and in them. As a professional writer and editor, I liked the story. It was a bit simplistic, but it worked.  It's a B-movie, a bit amateurish. The leads were quite competent, and it was never less than interesting. It isn't going to win any awards, but it has something interesting to say and it says it well.

Near the end of WW II, by an Englishman, J.B. Priestley, on a tiny island nation that suffered tremendously during that war.  ""we're all responsible for each other"" is what got them through that war and it was the prevailing attitude of the population at that time - it is why Churchill was not re-elected Prime Minister.

A revenge film with high octane action and plenty of kills, Colombiana was pretty ground breaking at the time. While the hyper speed pace remains, the superfluous jump cuts are quite dated. Colombiana remains a fun action thriller like no other.

Zoe Saldana leads the charge as the highly skilled assassin that is equally sexy and lethal. Colombiana persists as my personal favorite Saldana film. She is cool and clever as this heroine. Saldana made for the perfect action star in Colombiana.

Unfortunately, Oliver Megaton is not a great director, so his style muddles Colombiana overall. The movie is quick paced, but overly simplistic. The performances are believable, but the dialogue from Luc Besson is rather underwritten. The edits are way too frequent ruining otherwise interesting shots. The music is exciting, but feels melodramatic at times. The explosions and gunfights are very cool, but overblown.

50346,6332,161,"This is an extremely disturbing film about post war Bosnia and the human trafficking that prevails in that country.  The inhumane, savage treatment of young women is so painful to watch.  Young girls in their early teens are forced to engage in sexual acts.  If they resist in any way, they are tortured in such ways that are unspeakable.  The Bosnian men, on the whole, are crude, brutal, insensitive clods.

Kathy Bolkovac, a Nebraskan Police Officer, goes to Bosnia as a Peacekeeper and is confronted with the horrors of human trafficking which she desperately tries to do something about.  To compound the issue many of her fellow American Peacekeepers are involved in the sex trafficking and are receiving payoffs from the brothels, and are in cahoots with the corrupt police. And the U.N. refuses to do anything to protect these young women.

Ms. Bolkovac is summarily escorted out of Bosnia because of her investigation into the sex trafficking.  However, she does get to eventually report what she has learned to the BBC.  Yet, the sex trafficking still goes on in Bosnia.

This story is based on actual events.  Rachel Weisz as Kathy Bolkovac is outstanding.

He is helped by his General - also weak - who cannot seem to find a job and so ends up playing house ""wife"" to his leader.

50405,2323,4532,"I have to say that this is one of the darkest, twisted movies I have seen in quite a long time. Even after having watched thousands of horror movies over the years, there were still scenes in this film that made me cringe. It definitely does not come across as your average low-budget horror film I have almost become used to. Production values seemed excellent, considering the confines of the plot. Special effects were minimal but realistic. The acting was unusually good with some veteran actors, albeit most of their careers having been of the b-movie variety, putting in some outstanding performances.

If I had to choose one word to describe this film it would probably be ""realistic"", unfortunately. It depicts just how low man can sink when stripped down to their primal instincts. The characters start going ""crazy"" a bit sooner than I think most people would, but the timeline is otherwise realistic. It's definitely not a family friendly film, with plenty of gore, blood, nudity, sex, rape, profanity and plenty else to help this film earn an R rating. I was rather surprised to see Rosanna Arquette doing multiple nude scenes at her age, but I don't want to give too much of the plot away.

My biggest gripe with the film is the lack of coherence in the overall plot and the amount of loose ends left over at the end of the movie. It really leaves you scratching your head wondering why many of the elements of the plots happened and who they involved. The entire background about how this supposed nuclear war broke out and who was behind it delve pretty deeply into the science fiction realm before ultimately being ignored in the end. It definitely is not what you would call a feelgood movie.

50409,405,3729,"Put a swastika on anything and it turns into click-bait. I still don't understand what she did that was so special, other than having brown skin and an exotic name. Seriously? She deserves this kind of recognition because of that?  Many other vanilla skinned men and women died doing the same thing, yet they get no special recognition.

In our evolving globalist zeitgeist, the expansion of multi-culturalism seems to have created a need for portraits such as this. Because after all, we wouldn't want non-whites to feel left out of the greatest historical event in contemporary history. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful idea to highlight subjects like Muslims serving under the swastika, French African colonial troops defending Paris, black American units that saw combat (and Japanese Americans), etc. Some of these stories are known more than others, like the Native American code-talkers serving in the Pacific theater. However, certain topics (like this woman's story) are just sensationalized melodrama. It creates an urban legend simply because she was different...not because she did something extraordinary. The dramatic cover doesn't help much either.

Let's be real: she withstood Nazi interrogation for three weeks, likely without any form of torture because she was a woman. That alone does NOT make her a hero. Besides, she ultimately failed her mission. We are told that she had strong spiritual beliefs and refused to lie. That almost sounds more like arrogant insubordination, or what we now call the 'snowflake' syndrome. And it goes without saying that sometimes being stubborn, self-righteous, or head-strong can be confused with heroism or being 'patriotic'.

I'm not going to deny that she did her duty, but I don't think she deserves this level of attention. The production value is good, the reenactments are decent, and the interviewees are obviously sympathetic to her.

50416,694,2414,"Id never heard of this series until season 3 came my way but Im glad it did. What I found was that the series is one of the driest and funniest shows to come from British TV.

The show revolves around two main characters. Andy Stone (Mackenzie Crook), an agency worker with a degree in archeology thats going to waste, is married with a child, forced due to his work situation to live with his mother-in-law (Dianna Rigg). Lance Stater (Toby Jones) is a forklift truck driver and amateur musician. The two are best friends and both part of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club (DMDC).

Living in Danebury near Essex the main plot of the show is what takes place in their lives and how it revolves around their hobby which is being detectorists. Now Im not saying detectives but detectorists, someone who uses a metal detector trying to find treasure or historical items. With season three I gathered that theyve were granted permission to go over the same piece of land for some time now, with little luck to date.

This season finds Lance no longer living alone as his daughter Kate (Alexa Davis) has moved back in with him. Shes inconsiderate of his home and life, leaving the place a mess not cleaning up after herself and uncaring of any time he wants to spend in his own home with his girlfriend Toni (Rebecca Callard). The pair could spend time together at her place except that she lives in a houseboat and the waves make Lace seasick, the focus of one episode.

Andy on the other hand has found his dream job, working on a crew checking excavation sites in the hopes of discovering ancient relics. That comes crashing down around him when he discovers one, a set of tiles that excites him. Until the foreman tells him to ignore them and the next day he shows to work to find them covered over. It turns out the company he works for is more inclined to satisfy the clients who employ them by ignoring things like this to sign off that construction can continue without fear of disturbing anything.

What brings the pair together is their scouting the farm in search of artifacts when time allows. Moving meticulously across the countryside they scan for anything and begin to find bits and pieces though nothing major. But that comes into question with this season as the farm has been sold and the detecting is opened with their fiercest competitor trying to home in on the farm.

Worse yet is that we the viewers are shown that the pair are nearing what could be a tremendous discovery, a set of ancient coins that would not only be a major discovery but worth something as well. If it weren't for the magpies.

The series was a hit and also an award winner. Why, in a world where hit shows from other countries are revamped for American audiences, this one hasn't been adapted yet is beyond me. Fortunately with the series on disc it gives those of us here a chance to watch and enjoy the adventures of this unlucky duo.

But its not just their search that offers the charm of the show. Its their entire lives from their love lives to their home situations to their odd friends in the DMDC. They each have a charm that makes you care about each of the characters here and want to know what happens next. I found myself in the throes of binge watching once I began here, unwilling to stop because I was having such a good time watching and waiting to see what would happen next. That the series only lasts 6 episodes was disturbing as I wanted to watch more.

So take the risk and give this series a look. The performances by both leads is so low key and wonderful that you won't be able not to cheer them on with each methodical step they take on the farm. And youll root for something to happen to change their fortunes. These two everymen are a welcome addition to the world of comedic television and are worthy of your time.",1529798400,5,id never heard seri season 3 came way im glad found seri one driest funniest show come british tv show revolv around two main charact andi stone mackenzi crook agenc worker degre archeolog that go wast marri child forc due work situat live motherinlaw dianna rigg lanc stater tobi jone forklift truck driver amateur musician two best friend part daneburi metal detect club dmdc live daneburi near essex main plot show take place live revolv around hobbi detectorist im say detect detectorist someon use metal detector tri find treasur histor item season three gather theyv grant permiss go piec land time littl luck date season find lanc longer live alon daughter kate alexa davi move back she inconsider home life leav place mess clean uncar time want spend home girlfriend toni rebecca callard pair could spend time togeth place except live houseboat wave make lace seasick focu one episod andi hand found dream job work crew check excav site hope discov ancient relic come crash around discov one set

50424,405,5070,"Archaeology is NOT an exact science. 60-70% is the practice of educated guessing and intuitive interpretation. That being said, it is also a highly politicized field. Not surprisingly, the guy that is demonized as a racist (Reisner?) is not very different than the two archaeologists presenting their slanted views today. They all have their personal biases, whether it be old views of race potential, or modern dogma about 'oppression' and how everyone but themselves may distort or conflate something. Progressive arrogance. I would go so far as to say that the two men presenting have their own issues with oppression (perhaps homosexuality?) that colors their view of how others in their profession interpret data. To sum up, the field is too politicized for me to take very seriously. Then and now.

The rest of the content focuses on trying to justify that black pharaohs actually did exist, something that the American pan-African 'We Wuz Kangz' crowd has been insisting on for years now (often along with the notion that all whites were 'cave people'). Interestingly, the conclusions these diggers arrive at is that the Kushites temporarily controlled Egypt, but that the Kushites (dark-skinned Africans of modern-day Sudan) were disliked and treated horribly by the Egyptians (lighter-skinned Africans of modern Egypt and possibly Libya). Some of the art depicted Egyptians beating the Kushites and treating them horribly (like slaves!?). Note that in the depictions of the Kushites we see physical features that are much more alike those of modern sub-Saharan Africans, and the majority of Egyptian hieroglyphics and carvings depict a people with finer features (smaller lips, lighter skin, rigid jaw lines, arms , etc). We already know that both groups are genetically different, with North Africans being more like Arabs or Bedouins than sub-Saharan Africans.

So...what all of this really concludes is that Egyptians were NOT black as we think of today, and that the warrior peoples of East Africa, the Kushites among them, likely ruled parts of the Egyptian empire for short periods of time. That's far from the idea of the long-lived ancient black kings that many modern African apologists would like to believe.

50430,694,5555,"The search for Bigfoot has increased over the past few years, in part fueled by the series FINDING BIGFOOT. Combined with previous efforts to find the elusive beast weve seen how groups of people have banded together to search for this creature. But before all of that there were movies being made about not just the search but encounters with Bigfoot or creatures like them. One of the most famous was THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK which fueled the films of its producer/director Charles B. Pierce. Another was the schlock drive in classic SHRIEK OF THE MUTILATED. But one that rarely gets the attention it deserves is ABOMINABLE.

Made in 2006 on a minor budget the film didn't play many theaters but became a hit on cable TV. I can remember it airing to little fanfare but after watching it I was stunned. The movie is far better than one would expect.

Matt McCoy stars as Preston Rogers, a well off young man who lost his wife during a mountain climbing accident a year earlier that left him bound to a wheelchair. His doctor feels that the best thing for him to do to get over the sadness and guilt he still feels for his wifes death is to send him back to the cabin they shared near the mountain she fell from. Accompanied by a less than sympathetic nurse named Otis (Christien Tinsley who also helped with the creature effects) they reach their destination. Having forgotten a few supplies Otis leaves Preston behind in the cabin for the short trip to town.

While hes gone new neighbors in the cabin next door arrive, a group of young women out to celebrate the impending wedding of one of their group. Preston hears them arrive, stereo blaring and watches as they unload and go into their cabin. Hes later caught looking at them through binoculars making them assume hes a peeping tom. Looking into the woods hes stunned to see a pair of red eyes looking back at him, bumps his chair and is knocked unconscious.

After a nap Preston wakes wondering why Otis hasn't returned. Looking outside he sees a telephone pole blocking the road. Attempting to alert the girls next door they assume hes doing more window watching and ignore him. One of the girls goes out to use her cell phone and after looking away for a moment, Preston sees shes disappeared and her cell phone is laying on the ground.

A side note has three friends in the woods attempting to track down the best that killed the dog belonging to one of them during a short opening segment. As they do so they hear something in the woods. As one of them tracks it down, he finds the first missing girl as well as the beast, hightailing it back to the campfire and more fire power. But the odds of their surviving are slim.

Unable to get to their cabin because of his condition Preston is helpless to do anything but watch as the beast attacks and abducts another girl which the rest later discover. He yells to them and attempts to get them to his cabin but the beast attacks again. Not all will make it but one does. Now Preston and the girl must do what they can to survive before the beast returns.

Director Ryan Schifrin does an amazing job of telling the story using glimpses of the creature throughout the film but finally delivering with some great looking special effects to allow the viewers to see the creature full on. This doesnt cheat the viewer with a movie that never shows the monster in question but is used sparingly leaving you wanting more. He builds the tension nicely here, forcing the viewer to feel concern for Preston who is unable to do much confined to his wheelchair but not giving in at the same time.

While watching I kept thinking that the film felt like a combination of Alfred Hitchcocks REAR WINDOW melded with a Bigfoot film. I was pleased to find that this was what Schifrin was going for in the extras as he talked about the film. It does so in such a way as to not be a rip off of the classic film but putting its own twist on the idea and it works marvelously.

The acting is something that could have killed this movie. In the hands of terrible actors the movie would have been difficult to watch. Not to worry. McCoy does a fantastic job. Having seen him before I often wondered why he was never a much bigger star than he was. Haley Joel as Amanda, the girl that makes it to his cabin, also turns in a great performance. Her character isn't the standard dumb blonde bimbo here but someone capable of helping Preston as the two of them face off against the monster. Familiar faces to horror fans will be found here as well. Dee Wallace and Rex Linn are the wife and farmer attacked in the opening sequence, Jeffrey Combs and Lance Henriksen are the two friend accompanying Linn when they go searching for the monster, Paul Gleason and Phil Morris are the sheriff and deputy respectfully going to check on things and Tiffany Shepis is on hand to do what she does best which is be a scream queen.

Without giving it away or supplying any clues one more thing needs noted and thats the ending of the film. Where some movies on the subject leave you hanging or completely cheat you (as in WILLOW CREEK which I found to be a major disappointment) this one delivers what I think is one of the greatest endings of a horror film in some time. Enough so that I found myself smiling before the end credits began rolling.

MVD is releasing this film as part of their MVD Rewind collection, complete with old mom and pop video store packaging. Not only that they're releasing it with a brand-New 2K High-Definition transfer from the original camera negative giving it the greatest looking picture possible on screen. Extras are plentiful here with an audio commentary track with Schifrin, McCoy and Combs, an introduction by Schifrin, BACK TO GENRE: MAKING ABOMINABLE a featurette on the making of the movie, deleted scenes and extended scenes, outtakes and bloopers, SHADOWS Schifrins USC student film, BASIL & MOBIUS: NO REST FOR THE WICKED a short film written and directed by Schifrin with a score by his famous father Lalo Schifrin, the original 2005 version of the film, an improved version of the film with some minor alterations, the original theatrical trailer, a poster and still gallery, a storyboard gallery and a collectible poster.

This is a must have movie for both Bigfoot fans and horror fans. It delivers on all levels. Even fans of suspense films will want to make a point of watching this one. I know for myself I plan to keep this one handy so I can enjoy it again in the near future. I truly enjoyed it and cant recommend it enough.",1529798400,5,search bigfoot increas past year part fuel seri find bigfoot combin previou effort find elus beast weve seen group peopl band togeth search creatur movi made search encount bigfoot creatur like one famou legend boggi creek fuel film producerdirector charl b pierc anoth schlock drive classic shriek mutil one rare get attent deserv abomin made 2006 minor budget film didnt play mani theater becam hit cabl tv rememb air littl fanfar watch stun movi far better one would expect matt mccoy star preston roger well young man lost wife mountain climb accid year earlier left bound wheelchair doctor feel best thing get sad guilt still feel wife death send back cabin share near mountain fell accompani le sympathet nurs name oti christien tinsley also help creatur effect reach destin forgotten suppli oti leav preston behind cabin short trip town he gone new neighbor cabin next door arriv group young woman celebr impend wed one group preston hear arriv stereo blare watch

50448,5437,2025,"This is a perfect example of a film with inconsistencies, with implausible and sometimes even boneheaded actions on the part of the main characters, with irritating failures in reason and logic--but all of which we easily ignore, for the overall telling of the story is so superbly rendered.  The pacing, the atmosphere is so expertly developed, the acting so fine, that any lapses are swallowed up and overwhelmed by the excellence of the whole.

It's been a while since I've seen a film which establishes and maintains an atmosphere so strong and so in line with the subject matter.  Yes, the story is grim--and every scene of the film makes you feel it.  Yet it is not too much.  It does not wrench you into feeling its moments, but rather draws you in slowly and inexorably; it's as if we're apportioned a half-strength of the emotions felt by the characters.  This keeps us just comfortably out of harm's way, able to empathize, but enabling us to retain objectivity.  It's the perfect place I want to be, watching a story like this.",1529884800,4,perfect exampl film inconsist implaus sometim even bonehead action part main charact irrit failur reason logicbut easili ignor overal tell stori superbl render pace atmospher expertli develop act fine lap swallow overwhelm excel whole sinc ive seen film establish maintain atmospher strong line subject matter ye stori grimand everi scene film make feel yet much wrench feel moment rather draw slowli inexor apport halfstrength emot felt charact keep u comfort harm way abl empath enabl u retain object perfect place want watch stori like

50547,596,493,"Like a lot of movies in the last 25+ post Star Wars era from way back in 1977, this film is formulated to be an event, and has a quasi psychiatric and psychological manipulation formula with a Disney flourish at the end.

I mean the long of the short of it is that you should go on your adventures when you can, but the movie says ""no, you need to settle down regardless"".  And further, that hunting, for the film makers, comes in one flavor; hunting for sport, which shouldn't be done, but there are people who hunt to put meat on the table because that's how they live.  But this is an issue that's never addressed in the film, and could have been a watershed moment if the screenwriters were half as bright as they claim to be by the production values of this film.  Because otherwise the movie is pretty thin in its sociological message to today's children in terms of how we value animals.

The other big sociological message is that values have changed since the 1920s when hunting big game on safari was the wealthy elite pass time to partake in.  The classic socialite hero from the society column and theatre News' Reels is paraded for all his worth.  As well as his target of ambition, a befabled ""gooney bird"" of sorts.  I suppose that's a positive, but it's fairly one dimensional as per my previous paragraph.

I guess the thing that gets me about this film is that it's incomplete as per my first paragraph.  I don't like hunting, nor do I appreciate people who use terms like ""harvest animals"" as a supposed defanging of the term ""hunting"" to make it socially acceptable to slaughter wild animals, especially when you can well afford meat at the butcher's counter at your local supermarket.  But, there are people, a very slim minority (my assigned father thanks to the United States Army and maybe even the CIA) who hunt to help feed either themselves of their friends.  Again, we're shown the wealthy trophy hunter from days long gone, and not much else.

This movie also says to me that to settle down is better than to live out your dreams as you desire.  That's one of the poorest messages I've ever seen conveyed in a children's film, because the message goes on further to state that you can always live out your dreams later on.  Eh, well, no. especially if this movie is any example.  Oh sure, the story mechanics allow for wish fulfillment, but I think a better message would have been for the main character and his wife to go on their adventure and go through the same plot, only together without the emotional weight.  It would have been much in the same vein as ""The Incredibles"".

Instead we're given a pretty sour film that tries to allow an elderly man a second chance at adventure, when he should have had it all along with or without the woman he loved.  That's why I'm giving this movie so many stars instead of what it really deserves; one, maybe two, probably zero.

But, PIXAR-Disney production values offset the poor screenplay, but only just.  Some of the characters, notably Doug the dog, are likeable for who they are, and I'm sorry the antagonist or villain got the classic Hollywood ""evil at the core"" treatment instead of a more intellectual Miyazaki approach, and thereby wasn't allowed to evolve as perhaps he should have.

A pretty bland movie that lacks a lot of wisdom in the writing department.  Some wit, some sight gags, a little bit of intelligence, this is otherwise a pretty poor story.  See it once to enjoy it as a visual experience, but even then there's not much flash to it.

I'm sorry I rented it, but I'm glad I saw it at least one time.",1529971200,3,like lot movi last 25 post star war era way back 1977 film formul event quasi psychiatr psycholog manipul formula disney flourish end mean long short go adventur movi say need settl regardless hunt film maker come one flavor hunt sport shouldnt done peopl hunt put meat tabl that live issu that never address film could watersh moment screenwrit half bright claim product valu film otherwis movi pretti thin sociolog messag today child term valu anim big sociolog messag valu chang sinc 1920 hunt big game safari wealthi elit pas time partak classic socialit hero societi column theatr news reel parad worth well target ambit befabl gooney bird sort suppos that posit fairli one dimension per previou paragraph guess thing get film incomplet per first paragraph dont like hunt appreci peopl use term like harvest anim suppos defang term hunt make social accept slaughter wild anim especi well afford meat

With sexuality comes questions about preference of partner, parental and social expectations; and how these may inadvertently lead to hurting others and self.

50622,580,454,"Jurassic World is a very dumb movie with an unbelievable premise and generic characters that make idiotic decisions. I have so many concerns with Jurassic World. Why is there another Jurassic theme park after the first three movies? Do people never learn anything? How many more of these movies will audiences have to endure before a new story line appears? Why weaponize raptors? Why endear raptors when they are the main scare? Why hybridize dinosaurs? They already have T-Rexs and raptors which already terrify people. Bigger does not always mean better in the case of Jurassic World.

This movie falls into largely similar territory as The Lost World. Namely, the CGI is ugly and aged poorly very quickly. The environment is ugly and the setting is not explored in an interesting way. There are too many characters, so no one gets any character development. I could not even name you 5 character's names from Jurassic World. The John Williams theme to Jurassic Park is heavily underutilized and Michael Giachinno's score is pretty bland unfortunately.

Furthermore, the acting is atrocious. Chris Pratt is not convincing as a leading man. Pratt is no Sam Neill or Jeff Goldblum. He lacks charisma and realism. He makes me cringe hard. Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress but gets to do nothing but be annoying like Julianne Moore's character from The Lost World. What a waste of Vincent D'Onofrio, Nick Robinson, BD Wong, Irrfan Khan, and Omar Sy. All capable actors given nothing to do and nowhere to shine. Terrible writing, dialogue, and story lead to absolute failure.

Now to get the two sequences I enjoyed out of the way. I genuinely liked the underwater dinosaur scene that felt like a Seaworld show. It was thrilling and fun. I also appreciated the neat Gyrosphere set piece. It was a nice original sequence for some cool scares. I can admit when something works and the Gyrosphere certainly felt fresh.

On the other hand, Jurassic World is a 2 hour movie that feels like a 3 hour movie with about 1 hour of actual content. It is slow, long, and stupid. I hated it aside from the 2 aforementioned scenes.

This doc on Doc has some key details that your'd never find in the movie ""Tombstone"" about Doc's early years and dentistry. But it has some annoying flaws that should have been easy to avoid but were not avoided: they picked a poor narrator whose speaking voice is very average. He's no Peter Thomas (from ""Forensic Files"" the song ""19"" and the Tang TV commercial from the '60s). The best currently living choice would have been Jodie Foster, who has a great speaking voice for voice-over work, as she showed clearly in ""The Brave One.""  She could be the female Peter Thomas if she wants. The writing was poorly conceived at times and not proofread with common sense, e.g., when Doc died, they show his tombstone and talk of the funeral and never mention how old he was when he died. You might say they were economizing with words, but they were not. They gave the time he was buried, 4pm, which is trivial compared to his young age of 36. Any author who stresses, by mentioning, the trivial at the expense of omitting something far more important shows a lack of good judgment, which was maddening at times and might lead you to exclaim, ""What kind of braindead fools wrote this! - even a ninth grader would mention his age instead of the exact time he was buried, especially when 4pm is so commonplace.""",1530230400,4,like start fast without lengthi bore ultim redund preambl documentari eg dinesh america tell alreadi know first 15 minut tediou clich sentiment noth new brought tabl doc doc key detail yourd never find movi tombston doc earli year dentistri annoy flaw easi avoid avoid pick poor narrat whose speak voic averag he peter thoma forens file song 19 tang tv commerci 60 best current live choic would jodi foster great speak voic voiceov work show clearli brave one could femal peter thoma want write poorli conceiv time proofread common sen eg doc die show tombston talk funer never mention old die might say econom word gave time buri 4pm trivial compar young age 36 author stress mention trivial expens omit someth far import show lack good judgment madden time might lead exclaim kind braindead fool wrote even ninth grader would mention age instead exact time buri especi 4pm commonplac

Cara, who is new in town, befriends Grace a Downs Syndrome young girl, and she learns to care deeply for her.  They become fast friends.  However, other girls with whom Cara becomes friendly, are out to destroy the relationship, and almost succeed.  These new friends disgracefully ridicule Grace and other intellectually challenged young people.  Even Cara's mother is not particularly pleased with Cara's  friendship with Grace. However, Cara learns an important lesson about true friendship and what is important in life.  Grace is a sweet, caring, loving young woman.  This film is faith based and imparts a religious theme.

The salient feature of this film is bringing out the importance of showing respect for physically and intellectually challenged  people, and showing that they are real people with real needs who care, and love, and live, and smile, and dance, and have needs and wants, and must never, ever be called mental retards or dumb.

Amber House, who has Downs Syndrome, does an excellent job as Grace. Stacey Bradshaw puts in a very good performance as Cara.  The supporting cast is outstanding.

There was shock and horror, but there was little connection between the characters. I think the directing was too fast, the actors weren't allowed to find the heart of their characters. And I get that the music was supposed to be some kind of throw back to Gothic drama, but it really overpowered everything else with it's over-the-top cheesiness. Also, I was thrown when the male lead gave Mr. Rochester's speech from Jane Eyre. Was it supposed to be clever, to say that speech to the actress who played Jane Eyre? It completely distracted me from what was happening in the scene. Although, it occurs to me now that might have been deliberate, to highlight how phony he was.. OK, that is kind of clever.

Overall, I think the female lead was poorly written. The actress gave it her best, and she is very good, but she had too little to work with. She seldom reacted to things like a real person would. Coughing up blood? Huh. Weird wells full of blood-colored goop in the basement, with metal covers locked over them? The English and their peculiar ways.

50727,580,1382,"Director David Ayer wrote and directed this intense war movie entirely centered in an American tank during World War II. The characters are surprisingly complex and develop as Fury reaches its brutal conclusion. The close up shots and wide shots are really beautifully framed.

I think Brad Pitt gives a highly respectable performance as the leader of this tank unit. Shia LaBeouf also gives his best acting yet in Fury. They impressed me the most in the cast. Jason Issacs has a nice cameo as an American commander as well. The rest of this ensemble plays their part, but are not as memorable.

The music swells in a terrifying whirl of sound as Fury's grim lighting illuminates the horrors of war. Fury is gritty and realistic as you follow along multiple tank encounters. You are shoved into the tank's cramped compartments and little spaces with these characters. The cinematography is jaw dropping throughout the battles but then steps back when they are out of combat zones. Fury contains some of the most realistic and detailed wartime set designs for the German landscape and town side. The costumes are period correct and finely tuned to make each character look unique.

I only wish Fury were a little shorter and less contrived during the German town segment wherein soldiers are sleeping with the local German girls. It's awkward and awful and ruins the tone of the movie as it slows down the narrative immediately. Without this entire sequence you'd lose major character development, but it does feel like it hurts Fury's moral statements. You do see American and German troops vilified and humanized alike.

In short, I think Ayer made his best film with Fury. War movie fans will be thrilled with Fury's suspenseful onslaught, while other audiences will be engaged by the great acting and compelling story. Fury is a great war film in its own right.",1530316800,4,director david ayer wrote direct intens war movi entir center american tank world war ii charact surprisingli complex develop furi reach brutal conclus close shot wide shot realli beauti frame think brad pitt give highli respect perform leader tank unit shia labeouf also give best act yet furi impress cast jason issac nice cameo american command well rest ensembl play part memor music swell terrifi whirl sound furi grim light illumin horror war furi gritti realist follow along multipl tank encount shove tank cramp compart littl space charact cinematographi jaw drop throughout battl step back combat zone furi contain realist detail wartim set design german landscap town side costum period correct fine tune make charact look uniqu wish furi littl shorter le contriv german town segment wherein soldier sleep local german girl awkward aw ruin tone movi slow narr immedi without entir sequenc youd lose major charact develop feel like hurt furi moral statement see american german troop vilifi human alik short think ayer made best film furi war movi fan thrill furi suspens onslaught audienc engag

50740,596,1100,"One of the worst Star Trek films I've ever had the displeasure to lay my eyes on.  Everyone here is a caricature of the characters created in the 1960s for a show that probably didn't have a real long term goal at the time it was produced.  But, because of its quality, and because the front man for the thing Gene Roddenberry (a former police officer) was prodded to keep the TV show in the public mind, Star Trek kept on living and breathing throughout the 70s long after it was cancelled.

Movies are designed as tools for inspiration; good and bad.  And since the world has become more interconnected, allegedly old military thinking, as was showcased in classic Star Trek, is thought to be archaic.  Well, okay, if that's the case then how do you deal with the PRC claiming the South China sea is all their's?  How do  you deal with the Taliban running Afghanistan?  Star Trek, and specifically this Star Trek, is meant to showcase how ridiculous Captain Kirk and his crew were and are to the die hard fan base, and get us off of our fandom and love of the show that allegedly was create in ""another time"".

Eh, I'm not so sure.  The world isn't divided between the US and the USSR anymore, but there's still a schism out there, and I think the Hollywood types are misleading themselves by thinking that making these movies with all of the absurd high energy injected into the characters by the actors, is going to change our minds about high tech and its application to law enforcement, international security, and warfare.

Oh sure, it might sway a good bunch of younger minds, but, just as it took a revolt of the lords to get the King to sign the Magna Carta, so it was that it took a war between the three major powers during the War of Independence to establish the Bill of Rights.  But this Star Trek film says all that thinking is idiotic, old fashioned, and just plain crazy because only those who want to fight are screwed up in the head.

Well, whatever.  I mean you can insult every knight that ever lived.  You can insult every musketeer or minute man who served in some 18th century militia to fight for the very rights that Hollywood enjoys.  And you can insult and pretend that you're on the side of the servicemen who've been wounded and/or killed in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere to fight Islamic extremist (which Washington, Adams and Jefferson had to fight when they were in office), and again, pretend you're on the side of rights and civilization.  But, those men had fight for you and me.  And showing Captain Kirk as a warmongering arrogant machismo nutcase, when he wasn't, is really an insult to this Trek fan and all those who see through the continued psychological battery of things that fans like us love and enjoy.

I've said it here on this website, on the IMDB, and on other forums, at least I have my blurays and DVDs of the old show from way back in the 60s.  That'll never change, nor will mankind, no matter how much  Whether its Castro's offspring, Kim Jon Il's son, the fact murderous Idi Amin, Pol Pot, or even ""Uncle"" Joe Stalin helping us against the Nazis, there really does seem to be an attitude that ""all that's over and done with"".  It may be.  But if so, then why trash Kirk and crew with this trash?  I mean they tried it with Patrick Stewart (cast because he resembled the Shah, hoping his son would take up the mantle) in the famous contemplative scene where he stares down at Kirk's grave.  But nobody really bought it then.

I guess maybe there's a thinking that somehow this insult of a caricature of the characters and show will demonstrate to us fans just how absurd and ridiculous Kirk and his thinking, as well as Star Fleet as a whole, are just old fashioned and out moded.

Like I say, it may be that war as we know it is gone.  But, there will be a time when mankind will have to fight for those values which we and our ancestors have shed to much blood to establish and preserve, and when that time comes, and I'm sure it will, if the public's emotional thinking is so adjusted by this kind of fare, then as per Lincoln, if the thing for which the nation stood is no longer worth preserving, then all hope is lost, and tyranny will return.

I know that sounds pretty high minded, perhaps just ""out there"" and crazy, but again, TV and movies are used for inspiration, and this movie and it's two offspring are an insult to those of us who supported it for all these decades.

Or, in the immortal words of Commander Kang ""We have no devil, Kirk.  But we understand the habitations of your's.""

Rachel McAdam's and Jim K.. Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone were amazing characters, to me. This movie, to me, solidifies the truth that life is messy, people make mistakes. People with far too much money, with no sense to how to use it, make huge and colossal self-centered choices and think they can buy people. Circumstances are not always what they seem. And, oh yeah...trust your eyes and gut and do the right thing. Even if the immediate result is not pleasant, the truth will win out. I loved the body and facial expression communication thing in this movie. Not been done too many times before. The Hawaiian people are represented well here. The fact that the female pilot was a fourth Hawaiian, in my opinion, should not have been an issue. In life there will always be trolls trying to ruin a good thing. Usually patience and an open mind and heart take care of their negative efforts. Loved Alec Baldwins character and Bill Murray. The dancing and music in this movie are great too.

The only thing, or shall I say person(s), that make this show float is Damon...and Elena...and Damon's relationship with any given character, especially dear Bonnie. Damon isn't perfect; in fact he's quite flawed, yet wonderfully heroic and far more selfless than anyone on the show will admit! He's gorgeous (with the most stunning, blue/green eyes I've ever seen) stubborn, determined, and, ok, manipulative. He's also a hilariously AWESOME smart ass. He kills people from time to time. Sad, but he's not without guilt, nor is he any worse than any other ""murderous vampire"" on this show. What irks me the most is his brother. Stefan. No matter what horrible acts he commits, the other characters grant him a pass and pretend he's the ""good brother."" Why? I say it's because he's a smooth talker and likes to ""help people."" So? Damon helps in his own way. In fact, Damon busts his BUTT on numerous occasions FOR his loved ones. Stefan is PIOUS. SANCTIMONIOUS. And a RIPPER. I'll tell you one thing Damon NEVER denies: he is a sinner, oh, what a shocker, and he never claims to be anything other than a ""monster..."" because even HE doesn't give himself enough credit....but Super Damon keeps popping through this so-called monster, while his brother styles his ""hero hair"" and horribly fails to make me feel anything but a yawn rising in his presence. OK, sometimes Stefan makes me feel a little warm and fuzzy, and sometimes I like him. But seriously? SPOILER ALERT.....In season 7, Stefan's ""Personal Hell"" is DAMON? And Damon must learn to face that he is A MONSTER? Whoever wrote this crap needs to remember that the audience isn't stupid. We remember Stefan's BS, and we know that Damon is not just a monster- he is so much more and we love him for it!

Apparently BBC viewers did comment on this, and it has validity.  The first three episodes are excellent if one can get past the horror.  Episodes 4 and 5 spun off into ridiculous territory as so many of these TV series unfortunately do, thus ruining an otherwise outstanding story frame.  The overly personal intertwining of killer and police officer became tedious, unrealistic and plain not believable.  Boring is how it felt and we probably won't pursue seeing this series.

Most movies are derivatives of other movies.  Did you ever notice that when you're watching a movie, if feels like you've seen it a hundred times before?  Not this one.

I watched this movie without knowing absolutely anything about it.  I never heard of the movie, didn't know the plot, didn't know who was in the film, never read any reviews, didn't watch the play.

I was totally mesmerized each and every moment during this play -- not a wasted moment.

50804,580,5539,"Director Steven Spielberg crafts a stellar endcap for his legendary action trilogy. We see a young Indiana Jones, played perfectly in character by River Phoenix, at the start of his adventures. All the way to Indiana Jones, played heroically and hilariously by Harrison Ford, through to his most religious quest yet as he searches for The Holy Grail.

Thematically, we witness Indiana struggle to find his faith as he once again must wrestle between science and religion. Additionally, Indiana must come to terms with his father Dr. Henry Jones Sr., played wonderfully by the ever delightful Sean Connery. Furthermore, Indiana has to pick from greed, glory, lust, or family. In regards to lust, Indiana wants love in the character of Dr. Elsa Schneider played by the sultry Alison Doody. Doody is not only gorgeous, but a cruel femme fatale and foil for Ford act opposite.

Concerning Spielberg's direction, Spielberg masterfully takes the audience from one thrilling action set piece to another. Every location around the world is a ton of fun. The action, fights, and dialogue is as good as this series gets. All Spielberg's clever framing, lovely vistas, long panning shots, and realistic set design is on point. The Last Crusade is Spielberg at his creative peak.

Musically, John Williams brings his classic score for Indiana Jones to life anew with his latest version of the theme. Adventure and mysterious are complemented by Williams' score in its wispy hymns.

Overall, Spielberg should have ended the entire Indiana Jones franchise in 1989 with The Last Crusade on a massive high note. This movie is still exhilarating, engaging, and hilarious. You should certainly watch the Indiana Jones trilogy, but stop there and do not bother with Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

50823,7478,407,"This movie was...underwhelming. Slow-paced and just missing something to give it more spark. It mostly consisted of Caleb talking to Ava (the robot), and then talking to Nathan about his talking to Ava. There were a few good moments (like the dancing scene), and there were a few interesting moments that messed with Caleb's head. In the end, the whole thing was plodding and way too predictable - anyone who has seen other robot movies already knows how this ends.",1530489600,2,movi wasunderwhelm slowpac miss someth give spark mostli consist caleb talk ava robot talk nathan talk ava good moment like danc scene interest moment mess caleb head end whole thing plod way predict anyon seen robot movi alreadi know end
50824,7478,666,"I adore how imaginative this movie was. I love the attempts to theorize how gravity and black holes could work, and thinking beyond the 3rd dimension. The visuals (especially the black hole) were beyond stunning, and also very imaginative. The dialogue could sometimes use some work, but the actors portrayed everything brilliantly (especially Anne Hathaway). My only real complaint is that the music - as superb as it is - is too loud at points and drowns out the dialogue - we had to use the captions.",1530489600,5,ador imagin movi love attempt theoriz graviti black hole could work think beyond 3rd dimens visual especi black hole beyond stun also imagin dialogu could sometim use work actor portray everyth brilliantli especi ann hathaway real complaint music superb loud point drown dialogu use caption

50833,1247,2407,"Not the most exciting zombie movie ever made, but it had some promise. I liked the idea of Charlie being so obsessed with getting to Wausau, but there could have been more action in between his leaving his GF and then finding her. Also some of the story lines didn't make a lot of sense, like why didn't the jerks who wanted the take the girl, think of a better plan, that just asking nicely? And Charlie was so close to Wausau when he dispatched the old couple that he could have just left rather than kill them,  and if he didn't get caught what was he planning on doing? I realize that people making dumb decisions is standard procedure in zombie movies but that was too stupid. The other thing was the explanation of the outbreak, sounds like it was a terrorist attack, a very effective terrorist attack that seems to have wiped out the USA and left Canada as the dominant military force in North America. Canada needs to build a wall. don't really understand how the US went down so easily.",1530489600,3,excit zombi movi ever made promis like idea charli ob get wausau could action leav gf find also stori line didnt make lot sen like didnt jerk want take girl think better plan ask nice charli close wausau dispatch old coupl could left rather kill didnt get caught plan realiz peopl make dumb decis standard procedur zombi movi stupid thing explan outbreak sound like terrorist attack effect terrorist attack seem wipe usa left canada domin militari forc north america canada need build wall dont realli understand u went easili

50848,6693,4036,"This is one of those ""based on a true story"" movies. Unfortunately that is the same vein as reality TV; more TV than reality. That is the case with this movie. There is quite a bit of the Hollywood wrapper around this story. Nevertheless it is well procedure. It tells the story. The viewer  is drawn into the story. Nicholas Cage does an excellent job acting. What harms the movie is resolving the crime that took place over years (perhaps 10) and being resolved in 105 minutes.

50880,248,5721,"I love period dramas, and I thought the the premise of the series, the start of the New South Wales penal colony towards the end of the eighteenth century would certainly be of interest. Shot on location in Australia, the series had excellent production values. The sets and costumes gave it an air of period authenticity. The acting was excellent. The convicts, men and women were suitably grubby.. So, what was the problem?

The scripts were simply sub-par. Melodramatic, with overlays of twenty first century social and sexual mores that effectively kill any authenticity of time and place, the writing is what finished off any chance of a second season. Not even the excellent acting could validate the almost ridiculous plotlines.

50912,580,690,"Steven Spielberg directs one of his finest films with this relevant espionage historical drama. The idea that all people deserve rights and legal representation is more relevant than ever before. The direction is immaculately crafted with beautiful long panning shots and careful visual storytelling. We witness U.S., Russian, and German diplomacy during the Cold War. It's a very interesting prisoner negotiation movie.

The Coen Brothers wrote a very thoughtful and fair script that depicts all countries honestly, while also entertaining the audience with jokes and knowledge. Strong writing and dialogue leads Bridge of Spies to excellence.

Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead the charge with their complex portrayals of historical figures Donovan and Abel. Hanks plays it straight with some humor to humanize his lawyer. He captures Donovan's dedication to the law, justice, and decency. Meanwhile, Rylance plays Abel with a cold poker face and a knowing somber tone. These are great actors at their peak skills. Bridge of Spies is all the more delightful because of their performances.

In all, Bridge of Spies is an important movie for Spielberg to recount a moment in history, while also being accessible to all audiences and enjoyable simultaneously.",1530662400,5,steven spielberg direct one finest film relev espionag histor drama idea peopl deserv right legal represent relev ever direct immacul craft beauti long pan shot care visual storytel wit u russian german diplomaci cold war interest prison negoti movi coen brother wrote thought fair script depict countri honestli also entertain audienc joke knowledg strong write dialogu lead bridg spi excel tom hank mark rylanc lead charg complex portray histor figur donovan abel hank play straight humor human lawyer captur donovan dedic law justic decenc meanwhil rylanc play abel cold poker face know somber tone great actor peak skill bridg spi delight perform bridg spi import movi spielberg recount moment histori also access audienc enjoy simultan

50917,2521,2178,"What makes this show so good is that its lead actor, Edward Woodward, is so consistently good no matter how bad some of the individual episodes are. I don't know how Woodward got involved with this show, but it's good for him and the show that he took it so earnestly.

The show itself has an odd premise. McCall, Woodward's character, is a retired CIA operative whose specialty was overthrowing foreign governments unsympathetic to American foreign policy. In each episode, McCall either helps people from his previous life as a CIA killer, or else he helps average private citizens overwhelmed by crime and corruption. One message of the show is that US government policy focuses too much on foreign policy and not enough on domestic policy. McCall tries to set that balance right.

Frequently thought of as a vigilante show with an excellent actor, The Equalizer is more nuanced than that. It certainly has a right-wing focus--the show's creators show how McCall has the right to use weapons and high-tech surveillance to monitor and control undesirable criminal conduct. What makes it tolerable is McCall's shadowy past with the CIA and his on-going relations with his former boss ""Control"". The constant underlining of this background reminds viewers of how fallible and guilt-ridden McCall is. This fallibility is frequently a theme in many of the episodes.

The most remarkable aspect of this show, however, is how it simmered with so much talent--in front of and behind the screen. Actors include Kevin Spacey, Ving Rhames, Dan O'Herlihy, John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Macauley Culkin, J.T. Walsh, Vincent D'Onofrio, Michael Rooker, Tony Shaloub, Patricia Clarkson, Melissa Leo and Lori Loughlin. Director Tobe Hooper directs one of the episodes. Future Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow co-wrote one of the scripts. Police drummer Stewart Copeland wrote the exciting theme and most of the music for Seasons 1 and 2.

The show ended after four seasons, which technically makes it a flop. The complex political content was probably too much for some viewers, especially considering that in the early to mid 1980's most viewers during the Reagan-Bush years thought that America was actually doing good things in central America. Fortunately, home video enables us to watch sleepers such as The Equalizer and give them a second chance to catch on with audiences.

My only complaint is that picture quality is average at best, but frequently sub-par with pixilation and washed-out color. It's watchable, but you will need to adjust your expectations for picture and sound.",1530662400,5,make show good lead actor edward woodward consist good matter bad individu episod dont know woodward got involv show good show took earnestli show odd premis mccall woodward charact retir cia oper whose specialti overthrow foreign govern unsympathet american foreign polici episod mccall either help peopl previou life cia killer el help averag privat citizen overwhelm crime corrupt one messag show u govern polici focus much foreign polici enough domest polici mccall tri set balanc right frequent thought vigilant show excel actor equal nuanc certainli rightw focusth show creator show mccall right use weapon hightech surveil monitor control undesir crimin conduct make toler mccall shadowi past cia ongo relat former bos control constant underlin background remind viewer fallibl guiltridden mccall fallibl frequent theme mani episod remark aspect show howev simmer much talentin front behind screen actor includ kevin spacey ving rhame dan oherlihi john goodman lauri metcalf macauley culkin jt walsh vincent donofrio michael rooker toni shaloub patricia clarkson melissa leo lori loughlin director tobe hooper direct one episod futur oscarwin director kathryn bigelow cowrot one script polic drummer stewart copeland wrote excit

50928,1441,3932,"Katharine McPhee won me over not with her vocal chops - I'm not much into American Idol - but, rather, with her lovely turn as Paige, the one normal constant in a crew of eccentric geniuses in Scorpion, one of my favorite shows that debuted in 2014 but was just axed after three seasons. In Hallmark's 2014 romantic fable, In My Dreams, McPhee brings the same qualities that enamored me in Scorpion. She's still very much a down-to-earth and very sympathetic character. Doesn't hurt that she's drop-dead stunning. She's Natalie Russo, a restaurateur who's inherited the floundering family business yet is hesitant to implement the necessary changes to improve it. And then there's Nick Smith (Mike Vogel), the underappreciated architect. Nick's hope for a better career prospect rests on his winning a citywide bridge designing competition (not that we much give an ef about Nick's adventures as a draughtsman). What we care about is that Nick isn't much lucky in love, that a failed relationship in the past has made him into a serial dater. His meddlesome mom (JoBeth Williams) even tries to set him up with a clingy landscape designer (Rachel Skarsten) who was his childhood sweetheart when they were twelve.

I guess I should drop a plot spoiler alert for the fuddy-duddies.

In the local park huddles the Hayward Fountain, a quaint structure erected in 1903 from stones transported from the faraway ruins of a castle rumored to have been enchanted. There's an urban legend about this fountain, that pennies cast into it have a knack for bringing lovers together in dreams, and that these dream lovers then have a seven-day window to meet in the real world. So, there's Natalie. So, there's Nick. Both of them strangers on opposite sides of the fountain, both of them tossing a coin in on a whim. And, then, for seven nights, they dream about their true loves...

In My Dreams won't knock your socks off with an epic love story or explode your dome with earth-shattering plot twists or reveals. It's from Hallmark, the network that specializes in comfort food viewing. Yeah, there's a pronounced fantasy element here and a premise to make the diehard romantic swoon. But there's a restraint to the tone that I appreciated. Plenty of times, movies overdo or don't earn the swelling romantic score. I feel that this one's more grounded. It's partly the appeal of a supporting cast that includes JoBeth Williams, Antonio Cupo, Joe Massingill as Nick's supportive co-worker, Joe, and Jessica Wanlim as Natalie's best friend and co-worker, Sharla. Sharla is the one who pushes Natalie to go out on a limb and take chances on love. The two leads, McPhee and Vogel, are just, to use a British term, loverly, the both of them generating this unforced likability so that you grow to care even about, yes, Nick's bridge designing contest (I know what I said before, dammit) and about Natalie's efforts to tweak into success her family albatross, L'Agrifoglio Restorante (she even imports an Italian chef - played by Cupo - who I assumed would be a romantic rival for Nick). In a way, there's a dab of The Night We Never Met and Sleepless in Seattle in that Natalie and Nick don't really meet for real until the movie's end, meaning a crap ton of pining and hand-wringing from the invested audience. It's amusing that, as the movie went on, Natalie and Nick would primp themselves before going to bed in anticipation of a dream encounter, having fallen for each other in their own headspace.

You see all the tropes, including a series of near misses as the story keeps teasing us by almost but not quite bringing the two in together. The big story conflict is, of course, will they find each other before the seven days elapse? And that's where the biggest suspension of disbelief comes in. Because they could've just exchanged contact information during their dreams, right? Except a story like this one does require that you suspend your disbelief. In My Dreams is a satisfying watch for the steadfast romantic and for those willing to put their cynical side to bed for a bit. Katharine McPhee, did she even win American Idol? It doesn't matter to me. I like her lots anyway.",1530662400,4,katharin mcphee vocal chop im much american idol rather love turn paig one normal constant crew eccentr genius scorpion one favorit show debut 2014 axe three season hallmark 2014 romant fabl dream mcphee bring qualiti enamor scorpion she still much downtoearth sympathet charact doesnt hurt she dropdead stun she natali russo restaurateur who inherit flounder famili busi yet hesit implement necessari chang improv there nick smith mike vogel underappreci architect nick hope better career prospect rest win citywid bridg design competit much give ef nick adventur draughtsman care nick isnt much lucki love fail relationship past made serial dater meddlesom mom jobeth william even tri set clingi landscap design rachel skarsten childhood sweetheart twelv guess drop plot spoiler alert fuddyduddi local park huddl hayward fountain quaint structur erect 1903 stone transport faraway ruin castl rumor enchant there urban legend fountain penni cast knack bring lover togeth dream dream lover sevenday window meet real world there natali there nick stranger opposit side fountain toss coin

50969,580,3957,"Under the Skin is a slow burn that may not pay off for many viewers. Jonathan Glazer directs Under the Skin with a beautiful look and cinematography, but this movie is all aesthetics and ideas less so substance. All the lovely panning shots and unsettling sequences of genuine horror and science fiction intrigue leave you feeling empty with the hollow emotions of Under the Skin.

The main issue is the pacing. Under the Skin is only 108 minutes, but it feels twice the length. Every shot goes on too long, every scene feeling unfinished, every sentiment coming across as shallow. I get the idea of an alien that kills single men by luring them into darkness seems interesting, but her learning how to love is considerably less so. I think audiences everywhere with be bored to tears at the not surprising reveals and twists that Under the Skin has to offer. This is an neat sci-fi film, but a poor movie going experience.

Positively, Scarlett Johansson gives one of her most chilling performances yet. Her natural emotionless demeanor actually helps her transform into this seductive alien presence. Johansson gives her best acting in Lost in Translation and Under the Skin. This movie is worth seeing once just for Scarlett's cool portrayal and stunning beauty. I liked her in Under the Skin.

Overall, I feel like Under the Skin makes for a cool modern sci-fi movie, but it fails in engaging the audience. It is well made, but edited far too slowly for how little actually happens. If you like Under the Skin, I recommend seeing Arrival, Annihilation, or Oblivion.

51012,338,1097,"I enjoyed this action-filled film, which is packed with violence, thrills, and twists. It has a very good cast. Kevin Costner as Jericho, Gary Oldman as the CIA lead, Tommy Lee Jones as the doctor, and Gal Gadot, the woman who plays Wonder Woman in the highly acclaimed film of that name, as the wife of the dead CIA agent.
A well-trained very-skilled CIA agent was dealing with a man called the Dutchman who took cyber control of the US military and all its weapons, offering millions of dollars in exchange for the controls. Meanwhile, the Russians also want the controls, kill the CIA agent, and try to find the Dutchman. The CIA needs to find the Dutchman and the controls to save the US.
The lead CIA agent found a doctor who is able, so he thinks because he never did it before, to implant the memory of the dead CIA agent into the head of a vicious criminal Jericho. the implant works but only partially at the beginning, causing Jericho pain and confusion. The lead CIA agent is unable to get what he needs at the outset. At that time, Jericho remembers the money and wants it.

51014,1194,3833,"Gripping and well made, simultaneously uplifting and redemptive but also depressing and definitely apocalyptic, this is the beautifully filmed story of two people facing the end of the world in Perth, Australia. The day the film depicts beginning about ten minutes after an asteroid impacts the north Atlantic Ocean, there are about 12 hours before a global firestorm reaches Perth. It is heavily implied again and again everyone knows this asteroid strike was coming and really there was no way to survive it. The world is truly ending.

The story is essentially about how people chose to spend those final hours and how they decide to face the end. Will they fall into crime and violence? Party until they are numb and don't care? Spend quiet time with family and friends? Take their own lives and/or the lives of loved ones so they don't feel any pain from the coming firestorm? Face the coming apocalypse, wanting to feel and experience things up until the very last moment, maybe alone, maybe with those they love most, maybe with complete strangers?

The movie focuses on two people. We get James, the main character, who in the beginning is with his lover Zoe, enjoying each others intimate company on the beach and what they know will be a great view of the firestorm. Zoe, who tells James she is pregnant, wants James to stay, but James wants to join his friend for one final party and get wasted, blocking all feelings for what is going to happen and is really rather upset to receive such serious news on his last day alive. Understandable, certainly, but also selfish, and James leaves over Zoes objections to make his way to his friend Freddys party.

Along the way James encounters signs of the end of the world, one of them two men taking a young teenage girl into a house with the obvious intent to rape her. Torn between going on his way to the party and rescuing the girl, James finds he just cant leave the girl to that fate, even knowing she would die in less than 12 hours and rescues her.

The girl  her name Rose  was never someone James intended to bond with, but bond he does while hoping to find Roses dad (Rose and her father got separated) or failing that, leaving her with someone while he makes his way to the party, but events don't go as planned owing to a variety of encounters along the way. Also along the way James becomes less selfish and redeems himself, finding peace with his life and what he needs to do in his final hours, some of that from Roses positive influence, some of that from the quest to get her to her father and to do something selfless in his last hours on earth.

The movie was beautifully filmed with just gorgeous use of color and light. It had just the right touches of post-apocalyptic mayhem without being ugly or brutal (certainly nothing quite as dark as The Walking Dead or the like). Some of the encounters were tropes of a sort of this subgenre  people trying to take your working vehicle for instance  but others were not and a surprise. The actor who played James (Nathan Phillips) did a great job and was believable as he made the slow slide from selfish and nihilistic to a man on a mission to a man at peace, and Rose (played by Angourie Rice) was endearing, right between the line of a child and an intelligent and quite capable adult, precocious and frustrating and very well portrayed.

The movie reminded me a bit of Iain Rob Wrights novella _Tar_ and the novel and the movie _On the Beach_ but I think was superior to either one (though they are all quite good). If you like any of those three you would enjoy this film.",1530835200,5,grip well made simultan uplift redempt also depress definit apocalypt beauti film stori two peopl face end world perth australia day film depict begin ten minut asteroid impact north atlant ocean 12 hour global firestorm reach perth heavili impli everyon know asteroid strike come realli way surviv world truli end stori essenti peopl chose spend final hour decid face end fall crime violenc parti numb dont care spend quiet time famili friend take live andor live love one dont feel pain come firestorm face come apocalyps want feel experi thing last moment mayb alon mayb love mayb complet stranger movi focus two peopl get jame main charact begin lover zoe enjoy other intim compani beach know great view firestorm zoe tell jame pregnant want jame stay jame want join friend one final parti get wast block feel go happen realli rather upset receiv seriou news last day aliv understand certainli also selfish jame leav zoe object make way friend freddi parti along way jame encount sign end

51055,6850,3045,"As Hayao Miyazaki has gotten whiter of hair and older in age, the quest to find the next Miyazaki has steadily increased with mixed results for any anime directors so described.  On the one hand to be publicly described as the Next Miyazaki is a great honor; on the other hand it is also a stupefying burden, worst of all largely decided more by mere opinions than anything one can measure,.. with a single exception.  The latest Next Miyazaki, Makoto Shinkai, earned his designation the old-fashioned way: by writing and directing the highest grossing anime film of all time in 2016, actually beating the legendary Miyazaki himself for the first time in a long time, with Your Name.

Though knowledge of Shinto and Japanese can make some things a good deal clearer, it was Shinkais genius to tell a story that doesnt really require said knowledge; Americans and other foreigners should have no trouble grasping the main premises.  After some decidedly interesting opening scenes (that will be more fully revealed when repeated and expanded later), Your Name opens with what seems to be Yet Another version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaky-Friday/dp/B07CHS7B3X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaky Friday</a>: a boy living in Tokyo, Taki, and a girl living in the boondocks, Mitsuha, mysteriously find themselves switching bodies for a day, two or three times a week, and after realizing this, set some ground rules and leave each other notes on their cell phones and notebooks, sometimes even writing on each others skin, in order to cope with this mysterious problem.  They also use their talents to help each other out: Mitsuha builds Takis potential relationship with the college student he has a crush on, Taki boosts Mitsuhas popularity, and everything proceeds along very nicely.

But there is a dark side looming, and the indicators can be seen more clearly upon rewatching.  In a twist reminiscent of the first season ending of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate/dp/B00KU3Y5CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins;Gate</a>&nbsp;a truly horrific fate is coming, and soon Taki and Mitsuha are desperately trying to save over 500 lives,... including one of their own.  The price for doing so is high, and the movie fades to what appears to be a sad end as the price for the miracle,... only to end with another miracle.

Your Name was such a box office smash that it suddenly focused a huge amount of attention on the previously barely known Makoto Shinkai, and most people were astonished to learn that far from being his first film, Your Name was actually his eleventh, the seventh made available over here, though none before were anywhere close to being as successful.  (Your Name earned over fifty times more than anything else he ever did.)  And while none of these previous films were quite as good as Your Name, there was clearly genius at work in all of them, and they are certainly worth viewing.  One thing that becomes clear upon doing so is that Makoto Shinkai is that rare thing, a short story writer rather than a novel writer, and that he has a tendency to cut too much that needs to be corrected, proven by the fact that he has later written 6 mangas and worked on 3 light novels based upon his animes and every single one of them is an improvement, ESPECIALLY in the additional scenes and much clearer endings.  Anyway here is what you can find and see so far:

The movie ends with him after all this time preparing to enter the military and (hopefully) be reunited with her.  It is another stunningly beautiful short story, showing bits and pieces of their lives.

The dream in this altered reality in which Japan has been divided between Hokkaido and the rest, between the USSR and the USA, is to build and fly a plane to a mysterious, impossibly tall tower on the island of Hokkaido, allegedly used by the Soviets for the exploration of alternate realities; the girl is fellow student Sayuri Sawatari that they are both in love with.  However, her disappearance fractures their friendship and stops work on their plane, but three years later they are reunited by circumstances leading towards a world war.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garden-of-Words/dp/B00CJ7Y19I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garden of Words</a>&nbsp;(2013) his fourth feature (and most successful before Your Name) and at only 46 minutes in length, yet another short story about a couple of misfits, divided by age, but nevertheless drawn together by circumstances and weather until they are driven apart but with hope for the future.  It is also notable for being much improved in the later written&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/manga/dp/1939130832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">manga</a>&nbsp;and as-yet-unseen light novel by Makoto Shinkai.

Note: It is not uncommon for animators to briefly insert characters from previous films into later films (Miyazaki did this a lot) without necessarily needing to logically be considered connected to the originals, but there is a huge difference between something like that and the character of Yukari Yukino, a small character in Your Name who was also one of the two main characters in Garden of Words, with the same look, the same name, the same profession (literature teacher), and was portrayed by the same voice actress, Kana Hanazawa.  What is significant about this, though unstated, is the presumed character arc of Yukari, who has gone from being saved by Takao Akizuki from being all but immobilized in her life and her career in Garden of Words to surviving a comet strike in Your Name thanks to the frantic efforts of Taki and Mitsuha.  I wonder what she did and what she became as a result of it all?  And I wonder if Makoto Shinkai will ever tell us?

Note: The contents of the various versions are a little more complicated than usual so let me explain them.

51077,3730,2693,"This is a fun, cheap compilation of 80s horror movies, some of which are better known than others. It includes four feature films: The Blob (1988), Christine (1983), Fright Night (1985) and The Seventh Sign (1988). While hardly a collection of all-time classics, there is some gold to be mined here and this sort of horror movie grouping is just the stuff you need for your DVD player when Halloween rolls around.

The Blob: this movie came and went rather quickly when I was a sophomore in high school, but has since risen to cultic status, and justly so, because it's a rare case of a remake being better than the original. The story is simple. A meteor crashes near a small town, releasing a gelatinous alien creature which consumes all protein (read: flesh) that it encounters, growing larger each time it feeds. In its path are a variety of fairly well-drawn characters, including the town's motorcylce-riding rebel, played with cliched panache by Kevin Dillon. THE BLOB is surprisingly well-made and the deaths are gruesome and cut deep into the ranks of the likeable characters, giving you the feeling that no one is really safe. Throw in a government conspiracy and some well-known character actors and you have a very entertaining 90 minutes that are much leaner and swifter than the original. A very fast, fun film.

CHRISTINE: Okay, so this film is not the least bit scary, and the ""high school students"" often look like 30 year old men and women. Still, this John Carpenter adaptation of one of Stephen King's earliest hits is worth watching. CHRISTINE is the story of an old Plymouth Fury nicknamed ""Christine"" which has a personality all its own. Small-town nerd Artie falls in love with the car, and the feeling is mutual...so much so that Christine begins paying fatal vehicular visits to Artie's enemies, begins taking over his personality, and in the end, tries to knock off even his close friends. Christine is quite jealous, you see, and would rather see Artie dead than with anyone else. As adaptations go, this one is clumsy and rather badly written, but there is a certain energy and charisma to it all the same, and the sequences of Christine regenerating after taking horrific damage are extremely cool. And unlike modern horror films, there's no attempt to explain the inexplicable, either.

FRIGHT NIGHT: The best known movie in the collection is the tale of an ordinary American teenager named Charley who discovers that his next-door neighbor is a murderous vampire. Unable to get anyone to believe him, Charley enlists a worn-out, has-been actor who played a vampire hunter on TV, only to discover that he doesn't believe in vampires either. Meanwhile, the charismatic vamp is well on his way to seducing Charley's girlfriend Amy and his nerdy sidekick Evel. A battle of wills develops between the master vamp and the bumbling but resolute teen. I can't honestly say this film is very frightening at all; indeed, the emphasis is a little more on comedy, and the final confrontation is way overdone and makes me more sympathetic to the vamp than the heroes, but there is some nice acting work by Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell and just enough menace to keep things entertaining. This is more fun than it is horror, but fun is okay by me.

THE SEVENTH SIGN: This is a difficult movie to summarize. SIGN is the story of a couple, played by Michael Biehn and Demi Moore, who are expecting a baby. As they anxiously await birth -- the wife miscarried the first time she was pregnant -- various freak occurrences are happening all over the earth which seem to be portents of the apocalypse. At the same time, they take in a mysterious stranger (Jrgen Prochnow) who takes a very creepy interest in Demi's unborn baby, and are more or less stalked, in a semi-friendly way, by a priest who is taking a similar interest, also for unknown reasons. Obviously, everything hinges on the child; but the real question is not whether the child will be born good or evil but whether it survive birth or be stillborn. SIGN is a rather strange film, not frightening but occasionally menacing, with a few interesting twists; not very memorable, but not entirely forgettable either.

I gave this collection four stars more for the price than the greatness of the films, but again, I really dig these cheap collections, which are zero-frills but very respectable in picture quality.

51079,265,1575,"This remains watchable for those seeking some guilty pleasures in the form of boobs, gore and uninspired kills. Watch this for fun, not for horror.

Director Valeri Milev (Re-Kill) follows the sloppy patterns of his predecessors, opening with a breasty sex scene and a gory murder sequence. And with these death scenes this sequel reintroduces us to our favorite inbred hillbilly cannibals: Three Finger (Radoslav Parvanov; Undisputed 2-3, Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines), Sawtooth (Danko Jordanov; The Hills Run Red) and One-Eye (Asen Asenov). Unfortunately, they don't look as good as they used to (in terms of make-up quality) and they lack any sense of personality that differentiated them in past franchise installments (e.g., Three Finger was the loony and hyper one whereas now they're all equally off-kilter). Instead theyve been reduced to ugly, mutant hillbilly cannibals 1, 2 and 3.

In this shakily written sequel, a mysterious inheritance brings a twenty-something and his friends to a West Virginia Appalachian resort with a dark history and a weird pair of sibling caretakers. Keeping things classy, this movie boasts more sex scenes than death scenes, a stupidly convoluted plot (much as Texas Chainsaw 3-D) andif were being honestnot quite enough horror. It almost goes into pervy territory with its sexualized storyline and themes (even with respect to the kills). Not that it doesnt have its moments they're just heavily biased towards the final third of the film.

The razor wire death scene is engaging for gorehounds (and a nice call back to part 1), but much of the slashy/stabby gory effects rely on CGI finishing (e.g., an arrow through the head, the beheading). Such has been the case with the last several Wrong Turn sequels. At times I wonder if this is really less expensive than approaching them from a fully practical angle, or if its simply easier to handle these issues in post-production. But at the end of the day, these films continue to entertain me.

We enjoy a brutal leg break and dismemberment, an awesome headwound, the unforgettable anal firehose death scene, and a really weird family reunion reminiscent of Bleeders (1997) or Basket Case 3 (1991).

All in all, this was a moderately satisfying flick for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Certainly not worthy of being main event of the evening, but I got a few chuckles. The writing might be terrible, yet this sequel manages to entertain without much regret.  Youll feel more fun (or tedium) than fear.  But this could make for a great Bad Movie Tuesday if you're looking for some gory laughs.",1531008000,3,remain watchabl seek guilti pleasur form boob gore uninspir kill watch fun horror director valeri milev rekil follow sloppi pattern predecessor open breasti sex scene gori murder sequenc death scene sequel reintroduc u favorit inbr hillbilli cannib three finger radoslav parvanov undisput 23 wrong turn 5 bloodlin sawtooth danko jordanov hill run red oneey asen asenov unfortun dont look good use term makeup qualiti lack sen person differenti past franchis instal eg three finger looni hyper one wherea theyr equal offkilt instead theyv reduc ugli mutant hillbilli cannib 1 2 3 shakili written sequel mysteri inherit bring twentysometh friend west virginia appalachian resort dark histori weird pair sibl caretak keep thing classi movi boast sex scene death scene stupidli convolut plot much texa chainsaw 3d andif honestnot quit enough horror almost goe pervi territori sexual storylin theme even respect kill doesnt moment theyr heavili bias toward final third film razor wire death scene engag gorehound nice call back part 1 much slashystabbi gori effect reli cgi finish eg arrow head behead case last sever wrong turn sequel time wonder realli le expens approach fulli practic
51080,1030,5676,"Very good. The wealthy family was pretty well-rounded out. The suicide victim seemed a bit stupid. Or naive. True, the family kept making life difficult for her, but there were a couple of moments there when she made some bad decisions. Having money from one brother, why did she spend a holiday at the beach? Why not travel back to her home town and farm there? At least people would know her. Why stay in London where apparently she has no friends? Then, why lie at the women's charity place? That one lie made everything else she said suspect. But the coincidence of everyone in the family knowing her... I think the filmmakers could have made that more plausible instead of trusting in coincidences.

51081,889,3204,"This movie has the feel of a television movie because its special effects seem rudimentary.  However, this movie was released throughout the world starting in 2013, first in Russia.  By the time it was released in the United States, it was 2014.  The movie was filmed in Indonesia in 2011.

The story starts in an international high school (known as a college in Britain) in Jakarta, Indonesia.  A philosophy teacher, Mr. Zimit, on the last day of class with his group of 20 senior students who are about to graduate, plays a game/exercise with them.  Their passing grades to graduate from his class relies on this exercise.  He offers a scenario and students must come up with their own reasoning as to how they would handle the situation given.  A box of folded papers contains variables such as the career/expertise or backgrounds of a student.  For example, a student might be gay or might work as a politician or a doctor, etc.  In a life or death scenario, students must make the best choices that would offer them the best chance of survival.  It requires students to handle conflict and teamwork in order to gain the best solution.  The students get to argue their points as to why they chose one teammate vs. another, and they must live with the consequences as who they don't choose can die before the rest, and they must live with the people they choose to keep with them.

This of course seems like a fun game that anyone of us can play with our friends, and that's what attracted me to the movie.  It's a scenario game that you can set up with your friends in a party and discuss what can possibly happen.  Such a game of course requires a facilitator and in this movie the instructor is the facilitator.  The only problem here is that the instructor is part of the game and therefore, will likely have a bias because he wants to influence the outcome as he seem to know the answers as to what will actually happen at the end.  A true facilitator should not be in the game to prevent bias and to make the exercise fair.

In the movie, several scenarios are played, but all of them have a common theme.  There is conflict in the world that is about to cause a nuclear apocalyptic destruction where everyone knows that nuclear bombs are about to fall from the sky at a precise time.  Near them is a ready built bunker that has enough oxygen and food to last a year for 10 people.  The underground shelter will offer protection from the nuclear blasts, but the 10 people in it must live and deal with each other long enough to reboot the human race when they eventually get out of the bunker.  Of the 21 people in the classroom, 11 of them will be left out and will likely die from radiation poisoning from the blasts.  The group has only minutes to decide who enters and who stays out.  How do you choose who enters the bunker and who stays out?

As students make decisions, eventually something goes wrong or mistakes are made, and the teacher resets the scenario to include new clues or changes the variables, such as who is with what backgrounds.  Sometimes the bunker is in the middle of a desert and sometimes its near a beach.  Sometimes people do things for selfish reasons and sometimes people are more altruistic due to love or emotional feelings.  The reality is that there are no real right and wrong reasons when you truly think about it because we can't really predict the future of what might come next or what additional variables might arise.  We can only do our best based on the situation given and how each person re-act at the time that things are happening as emotions can change at a flip of a dime.  Due to the importance of procreation as a wanted outcome in the movie, sexuality does play a role as to how people might be selected.  Thus, one variable is that some people may be homosexuals while others are heterosexuals.  Sometimes the expertise of the individual may outweigh the person's sexuality as a need to be in the bunker.  With that criteria, this movie does have some scenes of sexual behavior and nudity, thus the reason this movie is rated R (for mature audiences).

Anyway, the movie is well thought out even though we can criticize that the exercises have some flaws.  In order to keep the movie less than two hours, I'm sure they could not include everything they wanted in this movie.  The special effects are rudimentary probably because of limited budgets, but the sets are well made and the actors were quite good.  The director did a decent job in telling the story and I'm glad the producers chose to make this film as it is thought provoking.  This is a great game to play with my friends and I would probably change up the scenarios.  The movie was entertaining if you don't try to get political about it as I have seen some reviewers try to do in their reviews.  There's no need to talk about the representation of the characters, as I'm sure if you ever play such a game with your friends, your circle of friends won't represent every race/sexuality/religion/expertise in the world or will only represent the same race/backgrounds as you depending on how you make friends.",1531008000,4,movi feel televis movi special effect seem rudimentari howev movi releas throughout world start 2013 first russia time releas unit state 2014 movi film indonesia 2011 stori start intern high school known colleg britain jakarta indonesia philosophi teacher mr zimit last day class group 20 senior student graduat play gameexercis pas grade graduat class reli exercis offer scenario student must come reason would handl situat given box fold paper contain variabl careerexpertis background student exampl student might gay might work politician doctor etc life death scenario student must make best choic would offer best chanc surviv requir student handl conflict teamwork order gain best solut student get argu point chose one teammat v anoth must live consequ dont choos die rest must live peopl choos keep cours seem like fun game anyon u play friend that attract movi scenario game set friend parti discus possibl happen game cours requir facilit

Instead, Bush and Saint Obama (the Peace Prizer) rewarded them with trillions. And then the citizens are supposed to forget about it and get back to shopping. Oh boy, the Super Bowl!

The movie didn't suck me in, and when the two women finally consummate their relationship, I felt like I was watching two straight Hollywood actresses simulate sex for the camera. I never felt like I was witnessing two people falling in love. It seemed more like a predatory relationship, with Carol using Therese, and Therese merely wanting to find out what life is about.

There were a few interesting subtleties, like Carol's trick of leaving her gloves behind early in the film, a small cue meaning ""please contact me"", back in the day before you could just exchange cell phone numbers.

51139,2808,147,"This movie was probably too low-key and uneventful to be a hit.  It's a wonderful story, though, about a young Latino mother named Juana, with a young daughter to support, who gets a job at a Japanese restaurant.  Not only is she an exceptional worker, she becomes intrigued by Japanese food, particularly sushi, and soon longs to be a sushi chef.  She has two huge strikes against her, however--she's a female and she has not been traditionally trained to make sushi.  (And those are the two main reasons, not that she is Latino, as she implies in a rant directed at the restaurant owner. A Japanese woman would have been considered just as unacceptable.)

In an effort to show she would be a good sushi chef, Juana enters a local televised sushi creation contest.  (The emcee is sort of weird and makes the contest seem sort of weird.)  While this movie has a predictable type of ending, it is still well worth watching to see how Juana works so hard to get ahead in life; to see how she interacts with her daughter and her loving father, who amusingly does not want to eat Japanese food, but Mexican; and to see all that goes on in the Japanese restaurant, including her friendship with sushi chef Aki.",1531094400,5,movi probabl lowkey unev hit wonder stori though young latino mother name juana young daughter support get job japanes restaur except worker becom intrigu japanes food particularli sushi soon long sushi chef two huge strike howeversh femal tradit train make sushi two main reason latino impli rant direct restaur owner japanes woman would consid unaccept effort show would good sushi chef juana enter local televis sushi creation contest emce sort weird make contest seem sort weird movi predict type end still well worth watch see juana work hard get ahead life see interact daughter love father amusingli want eat japanes food mexican see goe japanes restaur includ friendship sushi chef aki

51169,969,4486,"This is a difficult movie to review. For me it begs a few questions.

Apparently Hollywood rejected the film Candelabra for mainstream cinema audience as it was ""too gay"". And I notice the film has HBO stamped all over it. Well, hurray for HBO not being censorious: HBO leading where mainstream Hollywood fears to tread. And the film is about the lives of two people during times when such censorship was even more common - so maybe that explains the larger-than-even-gay life behaviour of the two characters a bit? Odd times, odd behaviour. How much of the behaviour in the film is true to the actual individuals, to gay people of that time - or down to straight people's perceptions, also the perversions of wealth? It's difficult to determine and fascinating to watch.

This film has major talent behind it, Soderbergh, Michael Douglas and Matt Damon. And I read that Michael Douglas at one time was a sex addict - of course, the public is at such a distance, who is to know? But these kind of 'facts' and his films certainly present a very straight man to me and then he takes this role and plays it with such relish, even desire. And Matt Damon, the hungry, (well-hung) puppy, happy to be his adopted son, but a little too dim to explain the bizarre relation 'normally' and convincingly to others. Bless.

So, the film is odd to watch, these two bent straights. I couldn't help but wonder how this gay old & young story translates to the straight old & young reality of Douglas' attraction to Catherine Zeta-Jones (and perhaps that's unfair, but as viewer you think these things . . .).

There is an odd (exemplary) scene: morning, showing Damon's young, naked torso in bed as he is about to wake up. When he awakes, the camera pans out to reveal Douglas' leering face alight, eagerly ready to have sex, as though he had been waiting there the whole night. It's extraordinarily lascivious, and on the balance of piss-take / perhaps bizarre reality.

I mention people's perception of gay life earlier, because throughout the film I wondered how much it supported the film (in perhaps correct perception), and then how much was cliche (in the form of generalised 'perceived' notions which can be prejudiced). But of course there is some truth in such perceptions; and particularly with this subject matter: Liberace IS such a case - fur, feathers, crystal, glitter, small puppies everywhere.

So, how to cut through such perceptions and represent 'reality'? In an area where reality is . . . a bit unreal.

Skilfully, Soderbergh, with two great actors, ensures the love in the relationship to come through and this is what saves what could have easily been a dismissable film. It's hard to make a perfect film, and when you chose a larger than life subject (which plays too easily into prejudices) it might be harder. For me, that the love does shine through in this film is the redemptive, AND NECESSARY element raising this film as a kind of document to an extreme aspect of a particular culture. It's a very fine balance (and I kind of giggle when I say that); finesse, subtlety are needed (giggle again).

Both actors are great in the film. For me, I was watching Matt Damon more, his character was more fated, tragic and unrelenting. Michael Douglas certainly threw himself into his role (I wondered how much of himself). It's still mind-boggling, the whole premise of the film - Douglas and Damon should do porn.

Why did I only give 4 stars. As I say, this film is difficult to review properly. In the end I choose gut reaction. The film didn't totally make me think WOW. I think the film's purpose was to represent a reality, it does this well. I can easily be wrong here, but I think a bit more honest dialogue might have made it more reflective of what happened.

51174,3303,956,"Quick Story:  Another Ed and Lorraine Warren tale this time set in England.  A family is tortured by a demonic spirit as the Warrens try to help.

Acting was mostly good. There were just a few moments I felt the words coming out of Ed Warren's mouth weren't carrying enough emotion such as the moment he continues on in the house when Lorraine is on the outside, it felt very flat there.  A few times Lorraine was overacting and trying to be too dramatic at times too.

Overall, Throughout the over two hours, this movie hovers between average to dumb to decent creepy.  It's a fairly long movie especially for a horror film.  Since it is so long, it takes a fairly long time to develop.  I liked the nun demon, that was pretty freaky looking and powerful.  The old man ghost kept hovering between being really dumb and cheesy to freaky too. I thought the jump scares used by this ghost in the 1st half couldn't have been any cheesier..they might as well had him yell ""boo"" each time..It had that feel.  There were some camera and editing effects I enjoyed - the moment the little girl blurred to the old man and back while in the arm chair. Otherwise the other effects were the same door slams, things moving on their own, things you'd expect from a possession or demon movie. Still this movie while okay didn't live up to matching it's predecessor.

  '''''''''  SPOILER ALERT NEXT;;;;;;'''''

 The thing I hated about the movie was how this film tried to connect the Amityville house with the England house by using the nun ghost.  The film begins at Amityville which had zero connection to the England case.  The England case also had not yet started as it began much later with the girls using the Ouija board which conjured the old man ghost.  Tons of dumb jump scares in the 1st hour as I mentioned earlier  (like when he yells ""My house!""  at the television scene, or the tent jump scares scream ""Ahh!' in the not once but TWICE in one movie - ...the first time the boy 1st half of the film.. and again Ed Warren near the end of the film, sorry script writing team, you suck).  So somehow the nun ghost transports to England from Amityville and the old man ghost is of no consequence in the end.  He actually becomes even less scary and more of a sympathetic character by the end as he helps Lorraine.  He just disappears too.  It's never even discussed why that nun demon was at both locations and also present at the Warren home.  So I don't hate the movie but I think like most sequels doesn't quite hit the same mark.  It's produced well, decent enough acting to enjoy this movie, but it's average at best.",1531180800,3,quick stori anoth ed lorrain warren tale time set england famili tortur demon spirit warren tri help act mostli good moment felt word come ed warren mouth werent carri enough emot moment continu hous lorrain outsid felt flat time lorrain overact tri dramat time overal throughout two hour movi hover averag dumb decent creepi fairli long movi especi horror film sinc long take fairli long time develop like nun demon pretti freaki look power old man ghost kept hover realli dumb cheesi freaki thought jump scare use ghost 1st half couldnt cheesierthey might well yell boo timeit feel camera edit effect enjoy moment littl girl blur old man back arm chair otherwis effect door slam thing move thing youd expect posse demon movi still movi okay didnt live match predecessor spoiler alert next thing hate movi film tri connect amityvil hous england hous use nun ghost film begin amityvil zero connect england case england case also yet start began much later

Leading up to the story's climax, the tale presents a number of twists and turns, and with a number of genuine surprises along the way.  All the production values are first rate - costumes, lighting, settings - and all the actors come out nicely credible.  (Possible spoiler coming here) However, the film's one big drawback was the overly didactic ending scene in which we all get counseled on the value of living better lives.  The moral presented is already obvious and is clearly based on the facts of the storyline, but the presentation itself is so blatant and overbearing as to seriously subtract from the beauty of everything that led up to the ending. That was the biggest and least pleasant surprise of the whole film.

I was set to give this film the widest latitude- I am a Christian and usually love to see high tech applied to biblical stories.  I don't mind a few interpretations here and there as long as the awesomeness of God is shown and the overall themes come through.  This film, however, managed to make one of the most fascinating stories of mankind BORING.  I think Ridley Scott was asleep when he made the film.  Or absent from the cutting room.  The film is a series of events- there is no reason for any of it to take place.  Gone is the theme of a powerful prince who finds humility through his true identity; gone is the theme that God is more powerful than man and THUS, justice will be done no matter how evil anyone or any kingdom can ever be; gone is the HOPE that because God is a worthy and just God, the poor and downtrodden will be delivered and the promise of redemption and salvation will come true; gone is the theme that a man becomes more worthy when he becomes true to himself, even if it means suffering 40 days and nights in a desert, losing all his worldly powers and riches and goes from princedom to shepherdom; gone is the incredible parallel between Moses' story and the coming of Christ, the Lamb who is sacrificed to save us all from the Angel of Death.  There is a reason the bible stories last so long in the imaginations of man:  they speak to the human condition in incredibly powerful ways.  Ridley Scott took all the good stuff out and left only the skeleton.  It became very, very boring and disjointed.  I found myself filing my fingernails, then my toenails... then, eh, I just decided to end the misery right before the last plague.

51196,1151,1993,"This movie is not boring, at least not on first watch: its a 'quest' or 'mission' story and actually quite bare-bones.

Two characters walk into a woods and suddenly there is a huge violin section playing . . . I hate it!) but it does most unusual sound effects  -  and those odd sounds are actually one of the down points: not the weird screeching, that is great!  but the sounds of large people walking on the ground.  Their foley people have made them sound like a large hollow bass drum in some places, perhaps by accident (?).  It should be a dead thump, not a 'hollow' one.  Some of the outdoor dialogue also has a fake bottom.
The sets and make-up and filming are all professional.
It's a good yarn, and shown in a way to hold the viewer's interest - at least for the first watch.  Maybe not too much after that because, as others have noted, the middle part (on the trail) is rather lengthy.  This is not a defect because enough 'weirdness' has  already happened at the start of the film to make the slow tracking of the antagonists not boring but rather suspenseful  -  and also because, in this throw-away culture which has hundreds of films trying to get our attention at any given time, the movie maker can't assume that anyone would watch the film more than once.",1531267200,5,movi bore least first watch quest mission stori actual quit barebon full gratuit music hell hide orchestra modern movi seem silli two charact walk wood suddenli huge violin section play hate unusu sound effect odd sound actual one point weird screech great sound larg peopl walk ground foley peopl made sound like larg hollow bass drum place perhap accid dead thump hollow one outdoor dialogu also fake bottom set makeup film profession good yarn shown way hold viewer interest least first watch mayb much other note middl part trail rather lengthi defect enough weird alreadi happen start film make slow track antagonist bore rather suspens also throwaway cultur hundr film tri get attent given time movi maker cant assum anyon would watch film

However, the story moves slowly and ploddingly along;  a good example of which is the first 22 minutes which consists solely of a completely unnecessary string of scenes in which Bill kills people in gun fights listed with places and dates.  When he gets to Deadwood, I thought, OK, they're going to settle into a story.  But they don't.  There are no relationships built.  Bill mostly sticks to himself, ruminates, smokes opium and has flashbacks.  It's boring.  Not only that, but they are really playing fast and loose with what known facts there are.  They didn't even bother to get Dave Tutt's death scene right.  Personally, I'd recommend watching ""Deadwood"".

51230,2904,792,"In His Steps is a decent movie with a positive message about faith.  The Church in a small town has become complacent in their faith, they go to worship every week- but don't really live authentically as the Christians they proclaim to be.  When a homeless man comes to town looking for work and is repeatedly turned away and mistreated, he speaks up during church and really asks the congregation what it means to be a Christian.  This interaction sparks the pastor to make some dramatic changes in his life and to make an invitation to the congregation to do the same by making a promise to ask What Jesus Would Do before making life decisions.  We follow the lives of the various characters as they implement these changes.
  I liked that the movie had a positive ending and that many of the characters made real changes.  Ron was my favorite- he was an absolute creep in the beginning, but through inspiration of watching his sister and Rachel deal with various events- he makes a genuine change and starts to live life as a Christian.  It's great that he gets the girl in the end because of his faith and the real changes he made to become an authentic person as opposed to Jasper, who from the start was only showing any interest in church and God to get the attention of Rachel, who is a friend, but obviously did not share his intense feelings.  He was dishonest in his motives and honestly just a big wuss!
  What I didn't like is that the story was somewhat unrealistic.  Turning down a singing career, that she had been wanting her entire life, just because she thought it wasn't what Jesus would do?  That seems a little overboard- why not use the newfound fame to promote worship and sing Christian songs?.  The pastor losing his job due to his new program  and the outright negativity from some of the church elders also seemed a little far fetched.  The movie made a good point and will make you think about yourself and your faith- so it is successful in what the writers intend to accomplish.  I only gave it 3 stars for the somewhat unrealistic nature of the interactions and the slow moving pace early on in the film.  Give it a try, it is free on prime, and wasn't bad for a quiet night.

51234,6459,2679,"The rise of modern nuclear technology in the United States, taking the ability to destroy cities and harnessing that energy for peaceful uses, can be largely credited to one man: Admiral Hyman G. Rickover. Working outside of the U.S. Navy's massive bureaucracy, his brash and vindictive manner proved to be exactly what was needed to get the first nuclear-power submarine finally launched. From his humble beginnings as an immigrant child within a poor Jewish family, he became an engineering genius that revolutionized U.S. strategic defense.

Truly, he was the right man at the right moment. The documentary does a great job in showing that. At the same time, though, the film's disjointed approach hurts it significantly.

1.  The show is very formulaic; i.e., the plot's setup and conclusion are always the same.
2.  The crime the defendant is tried for is always murder.
3.  The detestable character is always the murder victim.
4.  The defendant is never guilty.
5.  The truly guilty party is always in the courtroom, and (almost) always confesses.
6.  Mason never loses, and Burger (or his stand-in) never wins.
7.  The show will make you question how anyone from the 50s or 60s escaped getting lung cancer (everyone in this show smoked except Della, but if you research Barbara Hale, you learn she was practically a chain-smoker in real life, as if her voice alone isn't a dead giveaway).

51257,7300,3070,"This movie is very entertaining and suspenseful. The uplifting story about recovering from a traumatic past is one that will resonate with many people. The acting was quite good, and the chemistry between the two main actors is sizzling. The portrayal of the impact of depression and anxiety was pretty accurate; these illnesses can cost jobs and even lives.

There were some problems, however. First, the plot meandered at times. Indeed, they could have eliminated about 15-20 minutes without sacrificing any artistry. The good-looking actors cannot compensate for this weakness -- and believe me, the producers certainly tried to use sex and good looks to fill in the void. Second, the age of the young lover was a bit unnerving. I understand that they were trying to make the main character revisit his past, but having an adult dating someone who needed to make it home for curfew was a bit too much. Third, even though the movie realistically portrayed the effects of depression and anxiety, it didn't do as well showing the audience how to overcome these illnesses. Someone with the deep trauma of the main character would need therapy and, perhaps, even medication to become functional. One visit with someone from the past can't fix it. Fourth, the ominous music was a bit much - as others have mentioned.

Despite these weaknesses, I strongly recommend this movie. It is a good quality production with a positive message.

Bilko, Gomer Pyle, Brady Bunch regular). The ""bored captive critter longing for excitement in the outside world"" was a standard HB theme also used in Yogi Bear, Wally Gator and Squiddley Diddley, while Richochet Rabbit's spoof of the wild west was a lot funnier when Quick Draw McGraw did it. Even Punkin Puss & Mush Mouse was merely a hick variation on Tom & Jerry/Pixie & Dixie. The voice cast included veterans Don Messick and Mel Blanc, plus Howard Morris, who played Magilla's long suffering owner Mr. Peebles and gave Mush Mouse his patented ""Ernest T. Bass"" delivery. Perhaps the single best component of The Magilla Gorilla Show was its jaunty singalong theme, which originally incorporated the show's sponsor Ideal into the lyrics. While not on the same league as classics like Huckleberry Hound, Yogi, and Quick Draw, Magilla Gorilla is nonetheless a fondly remembered part of the Hanna-Barbera empire.

51278,607,4036,"I've read a number of true crime books, but haven't delved too much into movies.  I was actually steered towards this one - which I'd never heard of - by a review on another movie, so three cheers to Amazon reviewers for helpful recommendations!

The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.

The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.

Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.  Demons do live among us, sometimes frighteningly close, with angels as passionate about protecting people as the demons are about hurting them.",1531440000,5,ive read number true crime book havent delv much movi actual steer toward one id never heard review anoth movi three cheer amazon review help recommend movi intrigu number reason true crime drama john cusack play charact well john cusack dont get wrong love heck social awkward passion music good look articul guy much everyon interest see portray differ sort charact well averag guy next door twist desir dark secret push edg discoveri nichola cage play well nichola cage know somewhat top slightli kooki guy time nice role revers good guybad guy dynam con air ill need watch soon part play quit convincingli realist theme set movi dark pallor cast earli make want see monitor tv chang set werent pay attent action mainli come form suspens difficult scene littl humor break mood even wors mock truth behind tale given base true stori felt written script act respect happen victim famili demon live among u sometim frighteningli close angel passion protect peopl demon hurt

Mr. Cornwell is a descendant of our hero Uhtred of Bebbenburg, which meant his research was thorough and careful. The televised series covers two books each season, which means that parts had to be edited out. The main characters and events are all there, however, and the story is vividly told. The acting is just fine, though Alexander Dreymon as Uhtred seems to drift a bit in and out of a Danish accent. David Dawson is excellent as the pious Alfred, who is determined to unite all the elements of Britain into one country. Uhtred, as a brash and impulsive warrior, is his polar opposite, yet is continually drawn back into Alfred's cause - usually reluctantly.

The acting is stellar (who would expect less from Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar, Trevor Eve and Claire Goose, Cherie Lunghi and Gemma Jones and the rest) and the story is convoluted and interesting.  The investigation is challenging and fascinating.  The science is cool but not overwhelming.  The human interest is on point.

One thing I absolutely loved is that neither of the lead detectives were portrayed as broken people.  Not much of their home lives are mentioned at all.  And what is mentioned or shown is fairly normal and mild.  There are no criminal teenage kids or ranting lonely spouses or insane family members here.  It was nice for the main character not to be a recovering alcoholic or someone who never got over the loss of his child.  That stereotype has become so pervasive in Brit police dramas that it's time for a new tack.  And frankly, a story about the crime NOT the investigators' lives is a refreshing change.

And WHAT a crime!  I thought I was good at figuring these out, but I would have never guessed this one.

to the comments of 'women being sexualized': first off there were 3 scenes overall in the movie where there was a woman not dressed (beginning scene and 2 strip club scenes), and it was the main character's reaction in only 1 of them. and no sexual ACTS in the movie at all, so I'm not sure where they think it is in the movie..and yes, i'm female.",1531612800,4,like nice differ usual boy meet girl stori read comment saw movi shouldnt let review dictat whether want watch movi notbut onto review thought movi good actor plot fun twist event thing didnt like seem guy actual goal someon extrem shelter cours theyd understand naiiv comment woman sexual first 3 scene overal movi woman dress begin scene 2 strip club scene main charact reaction 1 sexual act movi im sure think movieand ye im femal

Chief Inspector Armand Gamache is called to the small Quebec town of Three Pines to investigate the murder of an elderly woman, Miss Jane Neal.  The movie meanders through its roughly 90 minute length, letting the viewer appreciate a tightknit and attractive small town while throwing out a number of clues.  The movie appears to have been intended as a setup for a series, as it devotes some screen time to building up the characters of Gamache and his investigative team.  The mystery will turn on an item associated with the murder victim, which may reveal her killer, if anyone can only interpret it.  Recommended as decent entertainment.

51317,2525,2667,"Nathan (Asa Butterfield; Esward Baker-Cohen,as 9 year-old) is a math genius, miserably uncomfortable socially. His dad (Martin McCann) adores him, grabs him,  sticks fries up his nose (his own) to amuse him.  Then Dad dies. His fathers simply spontaneous, equalizing, loving behavior models a sort of normalizing of ones own approach to kids on the spectrum.  There are more than enough peers, et al, who will have imprinted the weird label.  Mom, winningly played by Sally Hawkins, also adores Nathan, but shes tentative, chronically apologetic and unsure.  Her behavior feels almost enabling, so obviously self-doubting and lost, fearful shell say or do the wrong thing,  that she seems to reinforce his sense of differentness, requiring special effects, which prompts his rejection of her.  Nathans math teacher (Rafe Spall), preparing him for international math competition, is fabulously irreverent, has some deficits of his own, and picks up where Dad left off, even calling him some playfully acceptable names.  Therell be more significant characters that come into Nathans life: a lovely and smart teen, Zhang Mei (Jo Yang) and Richard (Eddie Marsan), who leads the math squad to the Cambridge Olympiad.  All the acting is first-rate.  I must say that Eddie Marsan is a uniquely gifted actor.  Its sometimes hard to initially recognize him, because he so inhabits every diverse role he plays, that he feels utterly new each time.

51318,7381,4180,"Two men meet by chance on a London street. The attraction is immediate and magnetic. Danny (superbly played by Ben Whishaw) is fond of the party scene, but is basically a decent guy. Alex is shy, mysterious, and shares very little about himself. Nonetheless, the two fall deeply in love and have an affair that lasts for months, until Alex's tragic death. The remainder of this five-part series follows Danny's frustrating quest for the truth behind Alex's murder. I won't give too much away, but it seems Alex, a genius with numbers and patterns, has developed a type of software that could change the face of the world. Unfortunately, the rich and the powerful have a great deal to lose if it becomes openly available, and Danny's life is turned into a living hell by the faceless powers that be. Yet he continues his search for a deadly conspiracy with persistence and courage. A remarkable cast is often undercut by turgid pacing, but this is still a suspenseful and thoughtful thriller.

51336,1138,82,"The film has already been summed up by thousands of people already, but heres my take on it anyway.

Mad Max Fury Road is an excellent action movie.  It had a lot of positive reviews for the movie upon its theatrical release.  Yet I was hesitant to really want to go see this movie.  I am not a big fan of reboot films.  The new crop of directors almost always screw up the backstory for well-known movies.  It seems to be an ongoing trend in Hollywood to either over explain the backstory ruining all the mystery or intrigue from the base material IE Rob Zombies Halloween films, Star Wars Prequels, The Hobbit Trilogy etc etc. Or the new films do the opposite insert a 10 second quickie flashback scene to fill the viewers in on what is going on.  Neither option works very well or does justice to the source material.  By having an opening text or monologue like in at the beginning of The Road Warrior might have been the best way to go to start off this film.  Other than that this is a highly entertaining action movie.

I for one am getting burnt out on all the goody two shoes superhero films coming out from Marvel every other weekend.  Thankfully Mad Max is an action movie that has meat and bones to it.  You will see violence and real injuries not 1000 shots fired and nobody getting hurt like the A-team, Transformers, Marvel films etc etc.

I think they got the bleak apocalyptic landscape right and the film definitely gives you that thrill ride feeling.  I found Immortan Joes compound fascinating.  Joe is a very scary looking villain.  Nux and the followers of Joe truly are crazy but interesting at the same time.

I am a big fan of the original Max Max and The Road Warrior films.  They are both very good action movies with great stunts.  MM3 Beyond Thunderdome not so much, but at least it was interesting and had some good scenes.  Who can forget 2 Men enter, 1 Man Leave.  That aside I wondered how the franchise would continue without Mel Gibson as the lead actor in all 3 of the previous films.  Thankfully Tom Hardie does a great job.  I liked him as Max I just wish he had a little more dialogue in the film.  You can tell he is a tortured soul but you are never really told why.
I do agree with some other people that the main hero of the story is not really Max but Furiosa.  Most of the film really revolves around her trying to escape with the other breeding wives of Immortan Joe.  The chase scenes are very good.  The CGI blended very well into the movie without looking phony or fake.  I always enjoy practical effects when possible over CGI but this film works on just about every level.

I would give this film 5 stars.  At times it feels like a rehash of The Road Warrior but the character are all interesting and the new characters motives and actions all make sense.

Naughty bedroom scenes approximately every fifteen minutes. 4. Gorgeous costumes, sets, and outdoor scenes filmed at the fabulous palace itself. The story focuses on the early years of the king's reign, when he first learned the wisdom of ""Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer"". Louis accomplished this by constructing a palace huge enough to accommodate all his nobles and insisting they live there. Louis and his brother, the flamboyantly gay (but surprisingly good military leader) Philippe have a tempestuous love/hate relationship. Which reminds me of another thing to expect: lots of shouting matches between the two.

51374,1945,1316,"while they're all fairly good, not all the seasons were worthy of 5 stars, however, i think this one is.  Every once in a while you're blown away by what was written, as well as the phenomenal acting in the majority of casts, even ones that only show up once & you never see them again seem to be decent actors.  For a change, there's actually a show where the plot is imaginative and you never know exactly what's going to happen next.

the foreshadowing is also quite sophisticated.  Juliette has been showing subtle signs of betrayal ever since season 1.  She acted as if nick was never good enough for her, and wasn't willing to listen to his beyond reasonable excuses. this is  something not everyone would pick up on, but i believe it was indeed ""planned out all along"" that her ""true nature"" would emerge into what she becomes during this season.  Not many shows will plan this out that far in advance like writers of novels do.  but it seems as if the best shows emerge from something that is written like a novel.

though it's very...well...""Grim"" with alot of dark, morbid & depressing moments, there's at least one thing in each episode that's guaranteed to lighten the mood.  i literally laughed out loud when jack the ripper took a joy ride in a cop car with a terrified wu in the back seat.  that's probably one of my all-time favorites.

CONS:  the downside to this is that sometimes they get a bit cheesy and cliche with their wording.  Sadly, it's a incurable disease among all tv shows nowdays.",1531785600,5,theyr fairli good season worthi 5 star howev think one everi your blown away written well phenomen act major cast even one show never see seem decent actor chang there actual show plot imagin never know exactli what go happen next foreshadow also quit sophist juliett show subtl sign betray ever sinc season 1 act nick never good enough wasnt will listen beyond reason excus someth everyon would pick believ inde plan along true natur would emerg becom season mani show plan far advanc like writer novel seem best show emerg someth written like novel though verywellgrim alot dark morbid depress moment there least one thing episod that guarante lighten mood liter laugh loud jack ripper took joy ride cop car terrifi wu back seat that probabl one alltim favorit con downsid sometim get bit cheesi clich word sadli incur diseas among tv show nowday

Helena Bonham Carter, Anne-Marie Duff and Carey Mulligan played the suffragette women who fight, protest, vandalize and cause a disturbance in reminding the public about their fight. The film was set in Edwardian England and is well-done. The film is worth watching for about two hours. The male cast members do a fantastic job in playing their roles like Ben Wishaw as Sonny Watts.

I had not read the novel, so cannot comment on any unfaithfulness to the plot, but I can say unequivocally that this interpretation is a riveting tale. Central to the story is the character of Pierre Bezukhov, sensitively portrayed by Paul Dano. Pierre, an innocent and trusting soul, has his romantic illusions of war shattered through battlefield experiences and his subsequent imprisonment by the French. Yet through the trauma he retains his sweetness and faith in his fellow man, growing wiser without bitterness. The sets, the costumes, the acting, are all superb. Special mention must be made of Lily James in the role of Natasha Rostova, who learns the meaning of growth through pain. Also impressive is Adrian Edmondson, who plays her dithering but kind father Count Ilya Rostov. Warning - the battle scenes and treatment of war prisoners are intense and not for the faint of heart. But Tolstoy's theme of enduring love and redemption shines through it all. The scope and power of this story lends itself to the large screen, which makes its successful adaptation to the smaller one even more impressive.",1531872000,5,tolstoy masterpiec lavishli brought life miniseri set napoleon invas russia impact three aristocrat famili read novel cannot comment unfaith plot say unequivoc interpret rivet tale central stori charact pierr bezukhov sensit portray paul dano pierr innoc trust soul romant illus war shatter battlefield experi subsequ imprison french yet trauma retain sweet faith fellow man grow wiser without bitter set costum act superb special mention must made lili jame role natasha rostova learn mean growth pain also impress adrian edmondson play dither kind father count ilya rostov warn battl scene treatment war prison intens faint heart tolstoy theme endur love redempt shine scope power stori lend larg screen make success adapt smaller one even impress

This series will catch you off your guard.
Do NOT expect purity among the police force.
You get a little humor mixed in with the blood. At times you LOL and other times turn your head at the disgust of the crimes and policing. Thats due to very fine acting and writing; you're intended to feel that way. There are several highly recognizable seasoned actors filling the lead roles, such as Elaine Cassidy (The Paradise), Alexandra Roach (Iron Lady), Paul Ritter (Vera), Will Mellor (Broadchurch), Charlie May-Clark (Death Comes to Pemberley) and more with Joanna Scanlan leading the cop force, and shes a force to be reckoned with. Episodes have changing cases and personal life events, but a Downs Syndrome case permeates the series.

[2] == A teen overdose inquiry finds an uncommon source. DC Dinah & DS Joy go undercover as party gals. Victim Cathy bunks with a cop.

I'm not familiar with 12-step programs, though I know of them; I am familiar with groups, classes and workshops aimed around amplifying the healing power of a person by the healing powers of the group he or she is in.  And that is what this film captures, so for that 5 stars.

It was inspiring, with moments of poignant drama well acted, and also some really funny moments and great dialogue between the characters.  Very well done.

That said, I think the reviewers here have sold it short, probably because of the bent on the 12-step program, but if you read the title and plot, you know what you're getting.

My favorite lines which I've never heard before, but supposedly come from 12-steppers: ""Worry is just meditation on shit,"" and ""Feelings are like children. You don't want them driving the car but you also don't want to stuff them in the trunk.""

51443,2005,3071,"I love historical fiction.  This is much more fiction than history.
The renovation and expansion of the gardens at Versailles was commissioned by Louis XIV when he was 23 years old.  No disrespect to Alan Rickman's acting skills, but there is no way in heaven he's passing for 23.  Or even for 44:  the age Louis XIV was when he moved into Versailles.  Rickman was 69 when this film was made; 'nuff said.  (And, by the way, Andre Le Notre would have been 48 years old when the gardens were commissioned.)
I understand that in historical fiction, conversations and moments are filled in from the writer's imagination in order to breathe life into the facts.  I would assume that if you're going to be fanciful, the result would be more fun.  But in this case, the result is phlegmatic.

The pace and tone of the film is listless.  The acting and cinematography are fine, but the love story and the story of the garden never takes off; the culmination of the film limps across the finish line.  I also wish that there had been a few lines/a scene showing how the hydraulics in the garden actually worked since it was a plot point and was revolutionary at the time.  And, honestly, what is going on with Kate Winslet's hair?  What is the bleached blonde color?  Why is it Always disheveled?  I understand it when she's working in the garden, but when she's going to a social event?  Doesn't this character own a brush?

51444,1757,320,"Love this film so much I've watched it twice.  This was one of those films I had never heard of and stumbled upon by accident and took a gamble on it.  Everybody was great and authentic in this from Jon Favreau who plays the lead, the ""Chef"", Sofia Vergara was charming as his ex-wife,  as well as other great supporting parts by Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, John Leguizamo, and Dustin Hoffman.  The top notch supporting cast of names no doubt did this as a favor for Jon Favreau, and how could you say no to him.  He directed, wrote, produced, and starred in this amazing film.  That may sound like a vanity project, but what an incredible passionate vanity project this was.

The story is more or less about this incredible Chef who cooks and runs a kitchen at a posh restaurant, but he butts heads with the owner on occasion played by Dustin Hoffman.  Because this Chef wants to cook what he wants, but that's not how it works in the restaurant business.  His ex-wife played by Sofia Vergara talks him into buying a taco food truck, which might sound doubtful, but turns into a real rags to riches kind of story.  This is about going after your dreams and creating your own work.  This film was lively, passionate, funny, moving, touching, and brilliantly acted by all performers.

Its because there is an extra 7th movie included as a bonus featurethe Spanish version of Dracula which is the same movie script as the English version but with Spanish actors.

I'm here for Naughty Or Nice, which first aired in 2012 but still doesn't have its own DVD release. What follows is what I think of that movie.

And some plot spoilers now...

Krissy Kringle (Hilarie Burton) lives on Candy Cane Lane, and she's not okay with it. She tells everyone who'd listen that she moved into her street before it was changed to Candy Cane Lane. She's heard the jokes ad nauseam that go with having her name. You can't blame her for being a bit resentful come the yuletide season. On her block, hers is the only house to go undecorated. The only light she has on is her porch light. Ooops, light just went out.

Krissy is having one of her crappiest Christmases. No hot water in her house. Credit card declined. Broken porch light. But at least she's up for a promotion at her ad agency. Just this past month she's brought three new accounts to Purcell Advertising. Look, her boss, Helen, just called her into her office... to fire her. So, now, no job, either. Luckily, she lands a new gig later that evening.

Except it's a hell of a step down going from chic ad executive to minimum wage gift wrapper at the mall. To maximize her chagrin, Krissy finds out she has to put on an elf costume.

On to something else. She's trying not to let it bother her, but she's been with her lawyer boyfriend, Lance (Matt Dallas), for six years now, and still no proposal. Krissy loves the guy. She also desperately wants to change her last name for obvious reasons. At a dinner with her parents, when her mom raises that same issue, oboy, Lance's silence is palpable.

It's Christmastime on Candy Cane Lane, and, in Krissy's solitary household, each day finds an avalanche of kids' letters addressed to Kris Kringle. One evening, as Krissy weeds thru a heap of mail, she comes across a mysterious, torn package. And, no, she shouldn't have opened it. But she did, and it's a book titled Naughty or Nice, the back of it titled Nice or Naughty. She shrugs it off, tosses the book aside somewhere.

Naughty Or Nice is a 2012 Hallmark movie that will delight you but, also, make you cringe in spots. The plot puts Hilarie Burton's character thru her paces. Krissy soon enough learns that the book comes with weird properties. It allows her, at a mere mention of a name, to peek at that person at their moment of weakness. And our girl, she's not above allowing vindictiveness to motivate her. There's Krissy gleefully exposing the naughty deeds of her tormentors. The rewards are immediate. The plumber that didn't want to come to restore her hot water? Just gave her a 50% discount on account of Krissy's having caught him in a lie. Her new boss at the mall - with the Australian accent even though he's not Australian - who's been bullying the staff? Fixed him, too. And so on.

Krissy's lucky to have made a friend at her mall job. Gabriel Tigerman plays Marco, Krissy's gift-wrapping co-worker, and he's fantastic as Krissy's sidekick and snags a string of amusing one-liners. He's the one person Krissy confides in about the book.

- Krissy: ""So crazy, but this might be the real naughty or nice list. Who else would have a book like this?""
- Marco: ""The CIA.""

I mentioned ""cringe in spots."" It's to do with those moments in which Krissy loses it and has these public freak-out moments. Burton slays these hilariously uncomfortable scenes, although you're glad it's not you caught in that same humiliating situation. And, throughout, she retains her appeal so that you don't turn against her, even though some of the stuff she gets up  to are mean-spirited, like how she outs her neighbor.

Will Krissy learn her lesson? Does a bear sh-- in the woods? This is Hallmark. In due time, it dawns on Krissy that she needs to see the nice in people, instead of focusing only on the naughty.

For fans of Family Ties, there's a mini-reunion in that Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter play Krissy's Christmas-obsessed parents.

One of the best visuals in the movie is whenever the camera pans up and down Krissy's block and we're treated to a grand view of all those festively lit, extravagantly decorated houses, including the awesome hologram reindeer loping around on that one roof.

51531,2525,5721,"Dismissed by the English ruling class as hopelessly unreformable, and taking up too much prison space, individuals often guilty of minor offenses, were shipped off to a penal colony in New South Wales.  Often poor, uneducated folks: one who stole food for his starving family, a prostitute, a pickpocket, a young woman accused of theft by a wealthy predatory employer, these are the kind of characters who populate the series and likely the original penal colony.  Many died on the ships that transported them.  Guarded by British marines, one the colony governor, the convicts are subjected to near starvation, floggings, having to share their women with officers, and occasional hangings. Youll witness love stories, partners challenged and threatened by commandeered sex with their overseers, other forced betrayals, some rivalries, some evidence of compassion by the rulers in the teaching of literacy.  But mostly youll notice a lot of strength, endurance, and loyalty among the folks who make up the prison population. This is, of course, a dramatic representation of that swath of history.  What is largely absent is the abhorrent effect of British colonization on the indigenous population.  The production is skillful, all filmmaking disciplines impressive, the acting first-rate.  A couple of episodes are a little slow, midway, but pick up steam again in short order.

51538,2215,1100,"The 4% who hate this, are emotionally compromised by their own idiocracy.
While this is by no means the best thing in the world, with no flaws and perfect everything, it is still a good movie. Opinions aside, the facts remain, this is an okay movie, meant to stimulate the mind, and evoke the emotions.
The actors they chose to reprise the roles in this alternate timeline, were no less than almost perfect choices. The more perfect choices were Scotty, Spock, and probably Uhura. The less perfect choices were the rest of the main crew, but still well picked. They fit well enough with the original roles, to make it funny, but stood enough apart to make one realize that this was an entirely different era. As they said in the movie, it's an alternate reality. Whatever might have happened, has now not, because of the events surrounding Nero (or Oren, with a little ^ above the e, in Romulan). So although they share characteristics with their predecessors, events have helped shape them into their own individuals. As Pike pointed out in the beginning, he believed Kirk acted out because he grew up without a father. His stepfather was apparently mean to him and his brother George (there's more details in the book and extended lore than the movie can show in this limited time), so he felt this need to ""rebel"", and it would account for this Kirk to be a little more brash and ""boyish"" than the original series Kirk. Which, of course, we see as much older, in the role of Shatner, versus the younger Pine. Spock, who did not lose Vulcan in the original series, and Bones who did not meet with Kirk aboard the shuttle to Starfleet Academy, are, of course, both different as well.
The directing was less than perfect. It's only when you're in the pitch dark on a tiny screen with maximum brightness, that you notice the terrible use of lens flaring. Or if you pa attention to those sorts of things, and let it distract you from the storyline. I usually ignore that part. Abrams, while not a bad director, did make a few bad calls, in the over use of basically everything. Less is more. Aside from the light show, the scenery is actually quite pretty. Not exactly what space would probably really look like, but there are also a lot of places that kind of do look like they're from a science fiction movie. Lots of pretty nebulas.
As far as storyline goes, while they did force a lot of things, and skipped over others, it's not bad. It's not quite the same ""secret but not secret"" storyline that the Trek shows did (like referencing ecology, eugenics, feminism, nazis, racism, gays, and all in space!), but it did help to establish a sort of ""backstory"" for this brand new alternate timeline, and pave the way for future movies. It gave you something that you could reference later on, in order to understand how this timeline works. While not the best in the world, compared to a lot of other trek stories, this isn't one of the worse ones. Definitely one of the better ones, in fact. Compared to, at least, some of the really terrible ones. And I mean terrible. If it was a bad idea, probably written by Roddenberry. The best scripts were usually Fontana's.
So, with that all said and done, and in conclusion, if you don't mind science fiction, you've never really gotten into Star Trek, or you're just bored and have nothing else to watch, give this a try. Why you wouldn't have seen it yet, at this point in time (seriously it's been almost 10 years), I don't know, but watch it. You won't regret it. Unless you're one of those 4% who are idiots who either try to hard, expect way too much, are idiotic, or just don't like science fiction in general and really shouldn't be watching this and reviewing it, then.
Enjoy.

51543,2890,499,"By it's very nature, science fiction is going to be unusual, confusing, and sometimes just plain weird. When it's done correctly, that can be a very good thing, but when it's not done the right way, audiences are left confused and annoyed. In 2014's The Signal, three friends are on a road trip, headed back to school for another semester of higher education. To their disbelief, a hacker who had been bothering them for months is still at it and is making things personal. Nic, Haley, and Jonah have some tricks of their own and ultimately track down the hackers address. To no ones surprise, it's on their way to school and they decide to pay them a visit. What should have been a fun moment, turned into something more sinister, when a deadly scream leads to darkness, and Nic (Brenton Thwaits) winds up in a quarantined hospital with no memory of what happened that night. I enjoyed the premise of this movie and as far as story goes, the idea wasn't all that terrible, what was terrible was the way in which it was presented. This buddy road trip film ends up in a hospital, where the friends are held for way too long. The hospital scenes are just strange, unexplained, and kill the movies momentum. Towards the end there are some better scenes, hinting that the film may be building up to an epic conclusion, but it's just more of the same, as things take an even stranger turn, and an anti-climatic one at that. As for the stars of the film, Laurence Fishburn gives yet another flat robotic performance. Morpheus was the perfect character for this guy, but he never seemed to be able to leave him behind, and now plays this same role in every film. On the other side, Brenton Thwaites, somewhat known for his breakout performance in The Giver, made this film for me. He was enigmatic, on target, and just fun to watch. I said it in my review of the Giver and I'll say it agin, this kid is going places. The Signal had all the ingredients for a great science fiction film, but when the cake was done it didn't taste so good. Most of the acting was flat, the story went off in too many different directions, and it was frequently anti-climatic.",1532304000,2,natur scienc fiction go unusu confus sometim plain weird done correctli good thing done right way audienc left confus annoy 2014 signal three friend road trip head back school anoth semest higher educ disbelief hacker bother month still make thing person nic haley jonah trick ultim track hacker address one surpris way school decid pay visit fun moment turn someth sinist deadli scream lead dark nic brenton thwait wind quarantin hospit memori happen night enjoy premis movi far stori goe idea wasnt terribl terribl way present buddi road trip film end hospit friend held way long hospit scene strang unexplain kill movi momentum toward end better scene hint film may build epic conclus thing take even stranger turn anticlimat one star film laurenc fishburn give yet anoth flat robot perform morpheu perfect charact guy never seem abl leav behind play role everi film

Then again, as he explains in a heartfelt moment to the perpetrators father, that dog was a last gift from his wife that she sent to help him, to allow him not to grieve alone, to give him hope. Take away that precious gift from an assassin that fellow assassins and hoodlums fear, and youve taken the leash off the beast. John Wick is a non-stop bloody action-filled movie that thankfully minimizes the gore while maximizing the body count. But watching John Wick in action is somehow at times catharsis for our loss of hope and happy endings.

51571,583,591,"As super-powered beings have become more common, and the ensuing battles between them more frequent and more wracked with collateral damage, a number of people have been becoming increasingly wary over all the superheroes operating without a specific mandate.  After an Avengers mission in Nigeria goes horribly awry, these concerns crystallize into a government-backed plan to have the Avengers register and submit to the authority of the United Nations.  Several members, informally led by Iron Man, back this idea, while others, spearheaded by Captain America, are opposed.  After a new disaster in Wakanda, plus behind-the-scenes machinations by other players, the debate spirals from theoretical talking point into full-out conflict between the two sides, with various characters from the Marvel Universe (several making their MCU debuts) brought in to bolster each faction.  As with the comics crossover it's based on, Captain America: Civil War finds neither side being either completely right or completely wrong.  Actually, I think it's more even here than the crossover was.  It's a multi-faceted movie, with characters on both sides of the equation getting a chance to shine in both high-level action and in character-oriented subplots.  It's one of the keystone pieces to the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe, and seeing this one actually helps you appreciate even more the other movies and where they're coming from.  This is one of the best entries in the rich wave of comic book adaptations we've been seeing over recent years.  10/10",1532390400,5,superpow be becom common ensu battl frequent wrack collater damag number peopl becom increasingli wari superhero oper without specif mandat aveng mission nigeria goe horribl awri concern crystal governmentback plan aveng regist submit author unit nation sever member inform led iron man back idea other spearhead captain america oppos new disast wakanda plu behindthescen machin player debat spiral theoret talk point fullout conflict two side variou charact marvel univers sever make mcu debut brought bolster faction comic crossov base captain america civil war find neither side either complet right complet wrong actual think even crossov multifacet movi charact side equat get chanc shine highlevel action characterori subplot one keyston piec whole marvel cinemat univers see one actual help appreci even movi theyr come one best entri rich wave comic book adapt weve see recent year 1010

51596,2663,2266,"It's been a very long time since I've seen a masterful Japanese film, and this one qualifies without reservation, on so many grounds.

I've never been to Japan, and much less understand the Japanese archetypes of which another reviewer speaks.

But the four sisters in this film---eldest Sachi (Haruka Ayase), Yoshino (Masami Nagasawa), youngest Chika (Kaho) and their newly discovered little sister Suzu (Hirose Suzu)---fit one another like a kid glove fits the most delicate hands, notwithstanding the horrible family dysfunctions that have affected each of them in different ways.

I am blessed with two sisters, and while no one will ever make a film about us, we have certainly shuffled through our share of family dysfunctions, and have always come out with pure love for one another.

This film is pure love, and I truly pity every child, parent and sibling who has ever become estranged from one another for whatever reason. Life is too short not to enjoy the gifts that one is given, and family, in this case, sisters, are the certainly one of the most significant gifts life has to offer.

This film captures myriad Japanese mannerisms and characteristics that one recognizes as unique to Japan. At the same time, however, it speaks in a universal language that all people everywhere can understand.

51611,1867,3719,"A fun, not-too-deep film from Linklater about that interesting time in history when the late 70s became the early 80s, set in Austin, Texas. Linklater mines familiar territory, such as the older dude who's still in the scene (the wonderful character Willoughby from California) and the last scene being a satisfied partier's smile (just like Dazed and Confused). It reminded me a lot of Dazed and Confused, with a little bit of romantic comedy thrown in and a slight sprinkle of philosophic musing (mainly in the character of Willoughby), but it's no Scanner Darkly or Waking Life. It does, however, hit the nail on the head capturing those first few days before classes start when you go to college and are exposed to the romance and partying on a college campus. The ensemble cast works well, and the actor who plays Nesbitt is a standout. There are a lot of natural, quirky, funny moments. I liked the inclusion of the jocks merging with the emergent punk scene. The film looks great, with a lot of detail paid to that time period (cars, music, fashion, technology, etc). It just doesn't add up to much, but is worth seeing once.

Shirin is engaged to marry Mike.  It is essentially an arranged marriage.  She works for her mother, an overbearing woman, who wants to run her life.  Shirin edits books in her mother's publishing firm, and is especially desirous of getting an interview with Rachel Harson an acclaimed author.  She sets out by car across country.  Her car breaks down along the way in a remote area, and she knocks on the door of a house.  A woman answers and welcomes her in and insists that she stay the night.  Shirin notices that there are numerous copies of Rachel Harson novels in the house.  She then looks at the back cover and realizes that the photo matches the woman of the house.  Shirin meets Rachel's son Will  the following morning whom she doesn't recognize.  He had taken her to his apartment after one of her mother's extravagant parties in which she had gotten drunk.  A strong relationship develops between Rachel and Shirin.  A romantic relationship develops between Shirin and Will.

Shirin's mother does not want Shirin to get involved with Will.  Will comes to the publishing house and Shirin's mother tells him that Shirin has eloped with Mike, which is a lie.  Will is devastated.  He is also overwhelmed because his mother has taken very ill.  There is also a secret that Will harbors which he reveals to Shirin about the books written by Rachel.

The film invites comparison to the ""Grey"" series even its in posters but, in truth, it doesn't deserve any comparison at all.  Other than both including the concepts of the intriguing dominant-submissive fringe in the plot, there is no resemblance between the two.  In this film, Charisma Carpenter's character falls prey to a psychopathic predator who gets his jollies by ruining people's lives.  He even goes after her daughter.  She learns more about the whole BDSM scene, turns the tables on him, and the story slides into an interracial femdom revenge fantasy.

51675,5423,3206,"Highway to Heaven is typical of family entertainment during the 1980s. Michael Landon not only stars in the series, but also produced it.

This set includes all the episodes from all five seasons. However, there are some caveats that may or may not influence your purchasing decision.
* There are up to five episodes per disc.
* Only one extra is included -- bloopers at the end of the first season.
* There are no subtitles or captions.
* Color density is somewhat inconsistent, going from washed out to some saturation.
* Contrast is also inconsistent, going from clean and sharp to being washed out (blacks are not black, but noticeably gray). This sometimes happens within an episode.
* Silk-screen printing is not always consistent from disc to disc within a season. This doesn't affect the shows, but it is an indication that there was little quality control in preparing and producing the series.
* Discs are stored in double-sided cardboard sleeves, which does an excellent job of protecting them from scratches.

Generally speaking, the shows are okay, and feature a wide variety of guest performers, some of which are famous in their own right.

The music by David Rose has never impressed me and doesn't really add to the show. If anything, it gets annoying, something that I remember from watching this show with my family.

There are a significant number of two-part episodes, but they are always on the same disc. I haven't checked to see if their appearance on the same disc is coincidental with the order in which the shows were broadcast, or if placing them together on the same disc was on purpose. -- It really doesn't matter, but is worth mentioning.

Disc production quality is really on worth two stars.

It revolves around the tough lives of a number of Texas utility lineman who maintain, restore and upgrade their part of the national electrical power grid. Its also about their families, like the events surrounding the Ginner family. The movie is based on an actual disastrous event as linemen go into the teeth of a monster 1999 weather event known as The Storm. Full of cliched events, the script lets down a very capable cast of John Travolta, Kate Bosworth, Devon Sawa, Julie Benz, Gil Bellows, Ryan Robbins, Ty Olsson, Stuart Stone, Reese Alexander, and Sharon Stone.

A Korean War vet and retired Ford autoworker, apart from his feelings for the men with whom he served, he seems to be something of a misanthrope.  His true partner in life is his dog, in whom he confides everything.  On the material but still sentimental side, he loves his pristine 1972 Gran Torino, having in part fathered it on the line.  As for his 2 sons and their families, his attitude is dismissive and pretty devoid of affection. You name a minority, and his slurs and contempt fire up.  The mere presence of the Asian family next door triggers that unsettling low growl. But he hasn't yet met up with gangs, schooled in warfare, but not this kind.  And something pretty monumental happens.  Youll see. The acting is solid, the performances of Ahney Her and Bee Vang in particular. Eastwood shines again in both his acting and directing Nick Schenks screenplay.

51716,7458,179,"Clint Eastwood does a great job of acting. On the other hand, the movie is marred, as usual in American movies, by things being laid on too thick. Most notably, in the scenes where Clint is trying to teach ""Toad"" how to act like a real American man, the movie got right the way men like to mock-insult each other as an actual show of friendship, but way overdid the ethnic slurs slung back and forthfar beyond how men together would normally behave, I think. Similarly, things escalate between the angry groups more quickly than they would in real life.

If there wasn't the standard Hollywood money-seeking urge to overdo everything operating in the background, this could have developed as the story of a surprising friendship between a crusty old American white guy and the listless teen Hmong boy next door, and how this old guy, who's not long for this world, models standard America business and casual man-to-man behavior that the kid could not learn elsewhere.

51717,2823,5673,"As I post this review, the US release of this TV series which aired on British commercial TV in 2015, is still 10 days from seeing its release in US on NTSC format from Acorn. I was provided with an advance screener in exchange for an objective review that I hope is helpful.
If youve read my other reviews on Amazon you will know that Im a huge fan of British (or Irish or Scottish) crime and mystery series produced by the BBC or ITV , which air on US TV on either BBC America or PBS.  I really prefer the home video versions because nearly every one of this shows has been edited (for either language or extreme violence  often both  and maybe even brief nudity). I prefer the original.

Im also a big proponent of not providing episode plot summaries (as some do in their reviews here) because IMHO it spoils the enjoyment. And I most certainly don't like spoilers, so you rarely  if ever  will find one in my reviews. After all, these are called mysteries for a reason. So, I encourage you to avoid reviews with way too many details.
With that said, I really wanted to like this series and the three main female characters are fascinating to watch. But, as the Creator Paul Abbott (responsible for shameless and State of Play says in a bonus feature (no spoiler here) I wanted this to be unlike any other show. Well, it certainly is. Each of the eight episodes (about 48 minutes each) has its own crime to be solved, but there is one main crime which connects the episodes together (and is solved at the end). It concerns a serial killer who rapes and murders (violently) young girls with Downs Syndrome. Pretty depressing, eh? Well Abbott turns the story into a cop/crime drama and slapstick comedy! Yes you read that right. You feel for the victims and, when you least expect it, physical comedy ensues. It is a bit jarring and that is why I can only give it a four star rating. The acting is great  though I found the casting a bit odd. Youll see why when you watch it  no, Im not telling you why.

British commercial TV is much more liberal in language and bathroom humor than US TV is so be prepared for strong language and potty humor (though no nudity appears). There are some pretty graphic violence scenes.

The DVD contains an 11 min Meet the cast and crew featurette (where I got the Abbott quote from) and 11 minutes of deleted Scenes (which didn't add much for me.

Be aware that each episode is preceded by an Episode Summary. I recommend that you skip these as there are plot spoilers included
When the last episode ended I wondered if there would be a Series 2. The conclusion made me hard to think some of the main characters would return. But, yes (SMALL spoiler alert) there was a second season (released in the UK) and my guess is that Acorn will bring it to us in the near future.

So, if you are a fan of Acorn mystery DVDs, you may enjoy this one. Though not the best of their releases, the cast is one that you will find yourself rooting for. Just remember, this a different kind of series. (Creators words)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

Looking at many of the other reviews I see that many people are expressing frustrations that the main character is not a stronger female heroine type, willing to stand up for herself more affectively against her over-bearing mother and loser husband. However, I think that this was an important aspect of the plot in and of itself. The important aspect is that she isn't in control of anything. A baby has taken over her body. Spoiler alert: she even attempted an abortion back in Chicago and was unable, for whatever reason to pull that off. She's been moved, practically against her will, back to the town in KS, where she grew up. Her over-bearing mother is now close by and able to better manipulate her. Her husband is a weak cup of tea that the mother is further manipulating and a couple of allusions where made that the mother & the husband may actually be having an affair! Now an opportunistic entity is also joining in on the bullying of the main character.

51780,342,3130,"""Into the Woods"" began as a Broadway musical under the genius of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. Perhaps, it's perhaps their best Broadway musical. Rob Marshall (Academy Award winner of ""Chicago"" musical) directs this production and stayed true to the musical format. Meryl Streep played the witch and did a fantastic job in her performance. The all star cast included James Corden, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, Anna Kendrick, Christine Baranski and more. The film is a bit dark for me. The fairy tales include Cinderella, Rapunzel, the childless Baker couple, Jack and the Beanstalk, Little Red Riding Hood and more.

So they take all those children's tales and build a Sondheim musical to it. It was really genius and ahead of its time. Audiences will find the film to be entertaining and delightful if you don't let the darkness bother you. The stories are timeless and really quite sad especially Cinderella's abuse, Rapunzel's isolation; and the infertile Baker couple who desperately want to be parents. The DVD comes with one special feature including Rob Marshall, Marc Platt (Producer); Christine Baranski and Meryl Streep.",1533081600,4,wood began broadway music geniu stephen sondheim jame lapin perhap perhap best broadway music rob marshal academi award winner chicago music direct product stay true music format meryl streep play witch fantast job perform star cast includ jame corden emili blunt johnni depp anna kendrick christin baranski film bit dark fairi tale includ cinderella rapunzel childless baker coupl jack beanstalk littl red ride hood take child tale build sondheim music realli geniu ahead time audienc find film entertain delight dont let dark bother stori timeless realli quit sad especi cinderella abus rapunzel isol infertil baker coupl desper want parent dvd come one special featur includ rob marshal marc platt produc christin baranski meryl streep

51786,583,114,"I admit that on the first watch, Guardians Of The Galaxy didn't totally hook me.  I felt that the comedic elements clashed with the rest of the big epic feel.  But after seeing Guardians 2 (and later Avengers: The Infinity War) I gave the movie another chance and was bowled over by how much better I liked it this time.  I'd expected I might like it better because I enjoyed Guardians 2 so much from the first time I watched it, but I wasn't expecting Guardians 1 to pick up by this much.  I'm now a convert - the comedic parts and the rest of the movie now seem an excellent match to me.

I liked the visuals and the cast of characters from the first watch on.  I'm now much more into the story and the way it was delivered though.  Multiple characters, alone or in groups, are searching for an artifact, an ancient metallic orb, containing within it an Infinity Stone, one of the most powerful objects in the universe.  The searchers include an Earthman who grew up in space, named Peter Quill (he prefers the name Starlord, but can't really get the name to catch on with anyone else), a pair of bounty hunters consisting of a walking tree named Groot and a bipedal, talking, machine gun-toting raccoon named Rocket (just don't call him a raccoon, he's very touchy about that), and the forces of Ronan, an alien Kree deeply opposed to his civilization's peace treaty with their traditional enemies on Xandor, which he now wants to destroy.  Two of his agents are Gamorra and Nebula, two 'daughters' of the mad immortal Thanos, who turns his adopted children into living weapons; the pair are sent by Thanos to aid Ronan in his vendetta against Xandor in return for Ronan's relinguishing the Stone to Thanos after Xandor's destruction.  Through a series of events and encounters, some intense and others deliberately farcical (in a good way), several of the searchers end up teaming up to oppose Ronan, finding themselves allied with another alien, Drax, who doesn't start off looking for the Stone but is looking to avenge the deaths of his wife and daughter at Ronan's hands.

Guardians Of The Galaxy is quite different from most of the other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, but its peculiarities and eccentricities are now pluses in my book rather than minuses.  Visually, the movie is awesome (I have to mention that I'd been waiting to see an actual Celestial in a live-action movie basically since I could read) and the characters are among the best in the MCU.  I think my favorites in this one are Nebula followed closely by Groot, but I like all the main players, all the different races, all the exotic alien technology, the whole lot of it.

Visually, the movie is awesome (I have to mention that I'd been waiting to see an actual Celestial in a live-action movie basically since I could read) and the characters are among the best in the MCU.  I think my favorites in this one are Nebula followed closely by Groot, but I like all the main players, all the different races, all the exotic alien technology, the whole lot of it.

51823,342,488,"Spotlight is one of two films that should be required viewing for journalism students. The Spotlight team uncovered a massive cover up in the Boston Archdiocese in Boston, Massachusetts in the early 2000s. Boston was rooted in its Irish Catholic roots. Boston is the hometown of the Kennedys and Bulgers as well. The film uncovered not only the abuse of power by pedophile priests but those who covered up their crimes including the Cardinal, Bishops, law enforcement and lawyers. The film conveyed how powerful the Catholic Church is in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Boston Globe's Spotlight team were determined to report an accurate account of the abuse, the lack of consequences and the cover-up under the Cardinal's power. The abuse has been widespread around the world. Boston was the first to attempt in uncovering it and successfully did so. The stories of survivors is widespread. The film has an all-star cast like Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and more to tell this story.

The film DVD has other features like the real reporters; the importance of journalism and a look inside ""Spotlight."" The film doesn't go into showing or depicting the abuse but rather alluding to it in verbal accounts.

51831,2005,4539,"With the death of Rose, the new characters that were introduced in Season 2 took over and the overall level of acting took a nosedive.  Mr. Piven, who, surrounded by high caliber actors in Season One was holding steady at a twitch, devolved into a puddle of twitching, significant looks, and double takes with addition of soap opera level actors.  Central casting must have called Overactors Anonymous to fill the ranks.
The writing seems to have gone downhill as well.  It started with the writers refusing to name - or even use an outdated term - for Roses made up lung disease.  (The real Rose died in the flu pandemic of 1918.  Why was that idea rejected, I wonder?)  All they gave were hints of how horrible it was.  (ie: Viewer:  Use your own imagination!) And yet, it apparently took 4 years to kill her.  And the storyline with Harry and Nancy.... Oy.

51834,2366,3239,"We like all the Raymond Burr Perry Masons.  Sadly, they didn't start making these movies until after some of the original cast had died.  Raymond Burr died in 1993, before they finished all of these movies.  They apparently has problems assembling a steady replacement cast of characters.  William Hopper, who played Paul Drake in the origial series had died in 1970, so they brought in William Katt to play Paul Drake Jr. for about 6 of the movies.  His character just wasn't nearly as good as the ""father"" Drake was.  They also tried using a young new lawyer as a sidekick for Perry Mason.  William R. Moses did a good job portraying attorney Ken Malansky, but an attorney acting like a detective for a sidekick, just doesn't work as well.  Though not in all of the movies, James McEachin, as Lt. Broc was the best replacement for Ray Collins' Lt. Tragg character or Richard Andersons' Lt. Drumm characters.  As for the D.A.'s that went up against Perry Mason, they never seemed to find a steady one to replace William Talmans' Hamilton Burger character.  I think of the long list of attempts, David Ogden Stiers' character D.A. Michael Reston was probably the best, and I think he hung in there the longest.  The last few movies, they pretended that Perry Mason was out of town and someone else was standing in for him.  Of the stand-in lawyers for Perry Mason, Hal Holbrooks' portrayal as attorney Wild Bill McKenzie was great.  Barbara Hale as Della Street is the only person who managed to hang in there from the beginning of the TV series to the end of the movies.  All in all we really enjoyed the entire movie collection.

51864,5334,179,"""Gran Torino"" is apparently Clint's expiation for all those Dirty Harry right wing bloodbaths of happy memory. In this movie he proposes suicide as an altogether more admirable way of confronting evil. Personally, I much prefer Harry's approach. The essential stupidity of this movie results from a combination of bad writing and bad acting (what else?). Walt Kowalski's family is particularly bad on both counts (especially the daughter). The Hmong neighbors aren't much better. They seem more like transplants from a sixties sitcom than from Laos. The relationship between Walt and Thao sometimes approaches that of Fred MacMurray having a heart-to-heart with ""Chip,"" as William Demarest bellows twenty-first century profanities from the kitchen.

Eastwoods opinion of himself as an actor has always been on the self-congratulatory side. This grim defacing of ""The Bad News Bears"" storyline is really a Walter Matthau movie, requiring an actor of Walter Matthaus stature.  Despite a crummy script, Matthau would have captured the depth and breadth of Walt Kowalski effortlessly. Eastwood's portrayal of him, on the other hand, is wooden and, frankly, embarrassing. He simply does not belong in movies like this, yet he insists on making them, and inserting himself in them, as though he were Matthau himself. At no time did I find myself wracked with sobs and ready to belt out ""Kumbaya,"" which is apparently the effect for which the writers were striving. Instead, I found myself hoping that Clint's orangutan buddy from the seventies would suddenly swing in on a vine and blow away the bad guys with a Mossberg 590A1. Not even Walter Matthau could have topped THAT!!

Eastwood's greatest successes have been as iconic outsiders. He is Dirty Harry, the Man with No Name, the avenging angel from ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""Pale Rider."" His sphinxlike impenetrability is, paradoxically, what draws us to him. The more he attempts to humanize himself, the less interesting he becomes (which is why ""Hang 'Em High"" is a dud compared to the Sergio Leone pictures). Even in merely ok movies like ""Heartbreak Ridge,"" the human being that he plays retains an indestructible inner core that is simply not available to the rest of us, and that core is the foundation of the movie. When he attempts comedy, or chick flick-style drama, heavy on vulnerabilities and ""relationships,"" he fails miserably (anyone wanna watch ""The Bridges of Madison County"" tonight? I didn't think so.). To the extent that Eastwood's movies have been about dramatic or comedic ""sharing,"" IMO they have been seriously miscast.

BTW, it is JUST AMAZING how many one sentence five-star reviews of this ten-year-old movie, almost none of them verified purchases,  suddenly appeared here in the last few weeks, shortly after a couple of negative reviews were added.  Forty or fifty of them!  For a while, they were popping up every couple of hours  like clockwork almost!!  Fascinating!!  (:D)

BTW, I feel particularly sorry for those who say that the movie is realistic in its portrayal of family relations: some families are bad news, but in my own experience, it has been the so-called friends who were most anxious to descend like vultures upon their best pals possessions.  A relation of mine was a very clever and inventive guy who worked in a machine shop and amassed an enviable collection of tools, some of them specially designed and one of a kind.  While his family was with him at the hospital at his passing, his palsy-walsy neighbor, who had been entrusted with a key, literally backed up his pickup to the door and cleaned him out.

  I am very HAPPY to see scientists updating their speil for once !  Unlike Egyptologists who still insist the Pyramids are tombs....  I really believe all those massive structures worldwide were built to convey universal laws of math and even spiritual laws.  Even the Taj Mahal had writing on it that no one ever bothered to take into account that has a very deep spiritual context.  I can't remember the name of the  only 1 program that proved it, a PBS show (not You Tube !)  There was originally planned to build a second Taj Mahal in all black across from it.  It had also compared it with the Kaballa chakra (?) forms in the surrounding front garden.  Grand universal principals !  Same for the Mayan Pyramids, and their calendar.  All those archeological fields sorely need updating !
  In this program they still continue that man descended from ape as a fact although it has never been proven ! ?  Basically it's a likeable good program, but it is still only from the White mans view of the world ( I am white). They continue to negate other people's historical stories.
  Contrary to others I APPROVED of the scientist taking the hallucinogen to attempt to see other people's viewpoint !  YAY !!!  (As a white woman, all the past health studies were done on white men only not for women etc. I am very GLAD to see a white man look from other viewpoints, it's growth ! )  It's not pushing drugs, I don't support that.
  Everyone is going to take issue with something in it.  I take issue with a gory murder scene in the first few shows.  I TURN AWAY FROM MOST POPULAR TV A MOVIES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO WATCH GORE !

  When I heard Salman Waksman  found streptomycin in soil i immediately googled him.  I read the ACA article that came up 1st above Wikipedia on Bing from my fIre tablet.
  There was a Biblical sounding quote but not Biblical ?  By Ecclesiasticus XXXVIII ,4-1. The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wise will not abhor them.  I didn't find it in the Bible, so I assume he was an early Greek or something writer.
  Well I've read several stories about eating dirt for curing certain ailments, one was the guy who started a vitamin company, he had an uncureable colon type disease where he'd wasted away to being very thin.  His father brought him a bag of dirt and told him to eat it and he got well ! Evidently he was missing enzymes or something from his system.  I know of more stories also.
  The point that struck me immediately is how we've polluted all our soils, from farming also all the household chemicals they sell us for cleaning, laundry, all those scented pellets, sprays, air fresheners are all chemicals.  Lawn chemicals etc on and on....  Good soil is a living mass of all kinds of things.  We got one of the best cures from soil, yet we went on polluting it because we were told and sold all these chemicals by people or corporations who only cared about getting rich.

51970,6597,4948,"This collection doesnt really add anything new to the available Lucio Fulci catalog. It merely combines three previous Blue Underground releases into one set.

Despite weirdly only containing 2/3 of Fulcis Gates of Hell trilogy and having the ultra sleazy and sadistic giallo New York Ripper in place of The Beyond, this is still worthy of purchase, provided you didn't get these movies as individual discs.

While City of the Living Dead and the slightly more subdued House by the Cemetery represent the best that Italian low budget horror films of the 1980s have to offer, New York Ripper is a tough one to watch. Because its likely that fewer people  have actually watched Ripper, and even fewer have claimed it has any merit, its the one Id like to focus on.

On the surface New York Ripper would seem to be senseless torture porn under veneer of pointless sleaze, but in reality its a pretty decent giallo. This film represents a pretty stark U-turn for Fulci from the surreal and supernatural horrors of City of the Living Dead or The Beyond to realistically representing the sleaziest side of life in urban America. Its not for everyone, nor is it of the same quality as the other two films. It is, however, a very well made bad movie.

If you have the stomach for the misogynistic violence, sleaze and gore, New York Ripper is actually no more unsettling or disturbing than the Hostel or Saw series. At the current price of $25 for this set, the inclusion of it should not be a deal breaker. Ideally this set should have included The Beyond, but apparently Blue Underground didn't own the rights.

51972,2262,494,"What could have been a successful serious horror flick plays out as a poorly-balanced horror-comedy.

A team of thieves break into what they realize (too late) is a house of sadistic torture, and they spend the rest of the film trying to escape.  There's your whole premise in a nutshell.

If the filmmakers had only pursued this premise seriously, ""Crush the Skull"" could have been a real horror thriller, given the fairly high level of acting, directing and cinematography.

Unfortunately, they chose to make the characters quirky and wisecracking, injecting way too much weak and misplaced humor that interferes with rather than compliments the urgency of the horror story.

A horror-comedy has to have a good balance of comedy and horror (as in ""Evil Dead II,"" for example), or else the comedy derails the horror, and you spend valuable time trying to get the horror back on the tracks.

That's exactly what happens in ""Crush the Skull""...They spend a few minutes building up legitimate suspense, then take a comedic time-out, then attempt to recover the suspense for a few minutes, then take another break for comic relief, et cetera.  The result is that the horror and comedy just don't flow together, as they should.

Consequently, about half-way through, this movie feels like it's worn out its welcome, and the remainder seems to just drag on and on and on (because the stop-and-go rhythm has become tedious).",1533772800,1,could success seriou horror flick play poorlybalanc horrorcomedi team thiev break realiz late hous sadist tortur spend rest film tri escap there whole premis nutshel filmmak pursu premis serious crush skull could real horror thriller given fairli high level act direct cinematographi unfortun chose make charact quirki wisecrack inject way much weak misplac humor interfer rather compliment urgenc horror stori horrorcomedi good balanc comedi horror evil dead ii exampl el comedi derail horror spend valuabl time tri get horror back track that exactli happen crush skullthey spend minut build legitim suspens take comed timeout attempt recov suspens minut take anoth break comic relief et cetera result horror comedi dont flow togeth consequ halfway movi feel like worn welcom remaind seem drag stopandgo rhythm becom tediou

51994,5700,1993,"Truth be told, I would honestly give this maybe 3 stars, but who bothers reading those lukewarm rational opinions? I enjoyed the actors and the situations and even the envelope that was pushed to limits commonly found only in comic books.
For the sake of decency and in an effort to warn parents and honor the Founding Fathers I give one star because it might be read and people will not only say ""Hell to the disgusting no! We don't want our precious little impressionable gifts from heaven, Bobby, Bobbie, and Whatev's, to be sucker-punched by the weird freakshow horror that is Bone Tomahawk."" This is not a family show, unless maybe its that family from The House of a 1000 Corpses. Now that was a fine horror flick.
This adults-only diversion spectacular needs a particular code warning viewers of the few minutes towards the movie's conclusion of a repulsive and potentially traumatic depiction of a person being drawn and quartered and the body parts thrown on the barby to be eaten by the desert cave-dwellers as they stomp about grunting and threatening, remarkably identical to Hillary. It reminds of a Sunday meal at the kids' table with giddy efforts at comedy waving chicken legs in the air and sporting black olives on our finger tips. Yes, we were blessed. However, the scary heathens need two hands to carry around a human leg while chewing on it. At this point in the show, I might have looked like the ultra violent criminal Alex from Clockwork Orange in his close-up during his reprogramming treatment, but that I was doing it because I wanted to and I need to ""see it through"" someday and prove to myself that ""I have what it takes"" in the self-confidence category as an amateur movie critic and foot dragger. Even though the moment of frozen horror was relatively brief, the effect was similar to the one I experienced when I saw Jaws at the afternoon cheap matinee. I went whole hog and purchased a large bucket of popcorn which I put under my seat as the movie was already starting and there's no ""How do you do?"" with Jaws on the big screen. No light comments humorously delivered about something in current events that everybody can relate to so you can laugh at the same thing a hundred unseen strangers are laughing at. Just the air not being inhaled like normal because many are holding their breath, sceaming inside and out, and getting a natural buzz from not breathing. Finally, after the shark exploded and the lights came up, I went ""whoosh"" and kicked my big popcorn with my heel and realized it was a shameful squander I had committed, but the magical power of Jaws had removed me from common humdrum life and I wasn't really at fault. Maybe I should give this Indy show more than one star. Was Jaws so much more righteous than this fine twisted western? Jaws was a great movie.
The truth is that I enjoyed the show, watched it by myself in the air conditioned comfort of my basement theater, and didn't need to worry about the impact that the extreme depictions might have on the impressionable.
I've been around the block and I'm not too afraid of ""the wild side"", and could easily be labelled as ""jaded"" like many others.
Another positive is the absence of the too-common moralizing hidden in the narrative by naive pagan college students trying to teach me what they learned in school, how to ""get along with weird perversions of every kind"" and that ""there is no such thing as weird perversions"" and  the rest of that squirrelly rehashed ""enlightened"" jive talk.
I'll stick with my Romans 1: 16- 32, thank you very much. Good movies are hard to find.

52035,1867,175,"Wow this is long. 3.5 hours. While I appreciate this version being available that stays truer to the graphic novel than the theatrical version, there are still things missing and/or changed that bug me. And while it seemed like a good idea at the time when I heard Watchmen was becoming a film, there's something ultimately hollow about this adaptation, however note for note it is to the source novel.

The main difference about this version is the inclusion of the Black Freighter pirate comic subplot, which was totally missing from the theatrical release. However, once (re)inserted, it comes across as choppy and disturbs the flow of the film (it doesn't do this in the print novel). There are also some more scenes overall than the theatrical release.

The ending of the film version has always bugged me, which was changed from the source, and there is less time spent on the backstory of Rorschach and his time with the psychiatrist, which was fascinating and brilliantly-done in the source novel. There are also little changes in the film like the removal of some smoking (Nite Owl's love interest doesn't smoke in the film), which seems to pander to current trends.

It's weird how a film that is so visually close to the source novel can ultimately come across as an interesting but kind of blah, raising the question: did this film really need to be made? I noticed in the credits that Alan Moore's name wasn't associated with the film.

What I found a better adaptation is the motion comic version of the graphic novel I saw back in the day on multiple DVDS.

52051,3712,3801,"This film was meh to me. Not great, not horrible. I wanted to watch something different from what Im used to watching so I thought a submarine/underwater movie would be great. Ive never seen a Jude Law movie before and as far as him and his acting, Im pretty impressed! He hasn't become a favorite just by this one role, but kudos to him in his speech coaching and gaining a Russian accent for this role! He did good!

Im probably a broken record here along with some of the other reviews but this movie was quite boring. I found myself fazing out of attention but every time I came to, I decided Id finish it because I paid the rental fee for it. Youll learn very early on that the plot is quite predictable. What GOOD could come from gathering a bunch of testosterone (men) into a small underwater tube?! Fights occur, unnecessary accidents happen.

I almost skipped past this movie after reading some of the reviews but I watched the trailer and saw Tobias Menzies (who I am obsessed with from Outlander) and got excited, thinking hed be in it. He was only in one scene.

So after about the first hour or so, the underwater scenes were pretty much all I stuck around for to watch.

52073,128,5506,"W.D. Richters The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension! tells the story of the titular polymath Dr. Buckaroo Banzai, a physicist, neurosurgeon, test pilot, and rock musician who must work to defeat inter-dimensional aliens called Red Lectroids from Planet 10. Banzai works with his assistants, the Hong Kong Cavaliers (Rawhide [Clancy Brown], Reno Nevada [Pepe Serna], Perfect Tommy [Lewis Smith], Dr. Sidney Zweibel [Jeff Goldblum], and others) against an all-star cast, including John Lithgow as Lord John Whorfin, Christopher Lloyd as John Bigboot, Vincent Schiavelli as John OConnor, and more. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Cavaliers must work to maintain control over their dimension-hopping technology as the Secretary of Defense wishes to control it for the military.

The film brilliantly alternates between science fiction, satire, and comedy in such a way as to recall the best of this type of 1980s sci-fi. At times, Richters work feels like a modern update to the classic adventure serial, as he drops the viewer into an established universe and even announced a planned, but unproduced, sequel in the end credits: Buckaroo Banzai Against the World Crime League. The film has since become a cult-classic and elements of it foreshadow the current shared-universe blockbusters.

The intense, deliberately-paced Western film Jane Got A Gun is a realistic tale of the life and times of Jane in and around basic, authentic-looking territorial settings of the 1800s. Starring a superb cast of Natalie Portman, Joel Edgerton, Noah Emmerich, Rodrigo Santoro, Boyd Holbrook and a cleverly-disguised Ewan McGregor, the film begins revolving around an intense search that is underway for Jane and her associate. And the ally she seeks for help is a surprise. But there is much more to this plot which has twists and turns and more unexpected surprises around each bend of the plot. Directed by Gavin OConnor.

52097,7099,407,"or, -- A Very Long Black Mirror Episode (just not in the M. Night Shamalon way.)

[Spoilers: broad plot arc points, big strokes]

Casting: Excursive dialogue fails the two male leads at times, but overall is quite good. You'll question Gleason to the end, but ultimately sells it despite some characterization gaps in the plot.
-- Oscar Isaac is credible as an insufferable Chad-Zuckerberg, but not as an Evil AI Genius AI programmer sociopath (which, it would appear, he isn't enough of at the end, to his detriment) -- the writing saves his bacon. Still better at this than as an X Wing pilot in the newest 'Star Wars' sequels. This will be the best film he ever is in.
-- Alicia Vikander is very good, exceptional given the relatively small amount she has to do/say as a robot.

Cinematography: Great contrasts, lush and verdant, to clinical and subterranean. Effects wise, no immersion issues.
Sets: Efficient and gorgeous, lends itself to themes, just right for the small cast.

Writing: In a film with this glacial a build up of tension, one has to be kept guessing right to the end. Successful apart from some weak dialogue interplay mentioned above (which at least serves the purpose of questioning just who Gleason's character is.) Vikander's character is incredibly well done, and serves to question the sincerity and reality of our own intentions and inner life at the same time as manifesting the ethical questions surrounding AI, and the reality of evil (sentient AI will be capable of choosing evil, or abstaining from self-sacrifice in an ethical double-bind.)

Every bit a film from the writer of 28 Days Later, and a great contribution to the AI/SciFi genre. Very watchable long, slow paced film that keeps you guessing, and leaves you with the right sort of questions in an open ending (more or less horrifying, depending on your own answers to them.) 7.7-8.3/10.",1534464000,5,long black mirror episod night shamalon way spoiler broad plot arc point big stroke cast excurs dialogu fail two male lead time overal quit good youll question gleason end ultim sell despit character gap plot oscar isaac credibl insuffer chadzuckerberg evil ai geniu ai programm sociopath would appear isnt enough end detriment write save bacon still better x wing pilot newest star war sequel best film ever alicia vikand good except given rel small amount dosay robot cinematographi great contrast lush verdant clinic subterranean effect wise immers issu set effici gorgeou lend theme right small cast write film glacial build tension one kept guess right end success apart weak dialogu interplay mention least serv purpos question gleason charact vikand charact incred well done serv question sincer realiti intent inner life time manifest ethic question surround ai realiti evil sentient ai capabl choos evil abstain selfsacrific ethic doublebind everi bit film writer 28 day later great contribut aiscifi genr watchabl long slow pace film keep guess leav right sort question

We have a new enemy, that is people who were immune from the virus and they have an idea on how to take over the world and we meet them in the US and the lengths they will go through.

At home, Chandler picks up two new crew members, an Australian & an Israeli who is both Special Forces stationed at Norfolk. We learn something interesting from the Israeli female soldier that surprises her (and us), namely that you would think that humanity would have stopped fighting each other in a post virus world but that didn't happen, if anything the fighting amongst people only intensified as we see mans evil.

The Australian turns out to be a martial arts expert in real life and the fights involving him are very well choreographed. We learn later that the producers added punching sounds based on what they thought were hits, but in reality were cuts inflicted on others, so they had to go back and re-edit the sound.

We learn something about Rachel and how she decides to seek retribution against the one man that was responsible for killing 5 Billion people.

The US is struggling but there is apparently more trouble brewing that I am sure well see in Season 3. I did not like it when one of the central characters was killed off. At times I thought I was watching 24. Yes, its fiction but I don't think that Chandler and the Nathan James can rest just yet.

52109,66,175,"The watchmen is not that popular.  But in this movie the story is well explored.  The script, plot, and story line were erected in depth.  Wrought with emotional dissonance; envy, depression, lethargy, apathy, fear, joy, love...There was betrayal and plot twists.  There was political plot, love story plot, and super hero plot.  The cgi and costumes were great, even for having to depict a story that was set to take place in 1985.  Morally, I think people can understand God by watching to the end.  There is no condemnation, nor consent.  The end is what happened, and all will continue on.  Certain events are necessary and man is not kind.  Though the actual Gospel of Jesus Christ is never mentioned, that is why a feeling of hopelessness and despair can arise over people as the credits role out.

52116,102,1616,"This is a parody of 80s slasher flicks, especially the Friday the 13th franchise. The story revolves around five teens somehow being translated into a fictitious 1986 slasher movie called Camp Bloodbath. The prematurely deceased mother (Malin Akerman) of the teen heroine (Taissa Farmiga) starred in the movie and she gets to meet her again, albeit as a young woman.

While this 2015 film is a throwaway flick its reasonably entertaining, especially if you're familiar with slasher films. What I like best is that it has heart and you can feel the loving relationship of mother and daughter. Its also nice to see Nina Dobrev again, whos one of the most alluring females in the cast, although shes outshined by curvy Angela Trimbur as airhead Tina.

The movie runs 1 hour, 28 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with some stuff done in Los Angeles.

Russell has a certain swagger about him that suits the western genre to a T. He owns every scene he is ever in much like McCready in The Thing. It has a very basic and well-trodden plot of breaking taboos, being punished for the intrusion, and the chase for revenge, which is a fine plot for any western, particularly with spooky overtones. The heroes form quite a cabal of misfit anti-heroes and paladins, just like any tabletop roleplaying game.

52127,5696,3482,"I started off watching this with a skeptical mind; the plot involved an 11-year-old girl who mysteriously goes missing, but she somehow managed to keep a diary of her thoughts, and hid it inside a stuffed animal. Right there this struck me as pretty implausible - what 11-year-old keeps a pencil-and-notebook diary at all nowadays (except maybe Amish, or Mormons)? So this kept the movie at a solid 3 stars for me... until it got to the end.
Not going to lie - the ending scared me pretty good. I am an avid horror fan, but I have to say that I don't think this movie is suitable for all viewers. It's not that it's particularly raunchy, or bloody at the end; it's more to do with that creepy, this-is-making-my-skin-crawl feeling you sometimes get, and in this case it wasn't at all comfortable. This is a dark movie. After it was over I said a silent prayer of thanks to God; I'm glad I believe in God, and I'm glad I don't know anyone like the 'friendly neighborhood couple' portrayed in this story (they were frightening).  'Monster movies' can be wonderfully entertaining, but at the end you usually breathe a sigh of relief because you know that monsters aren't real. When 'monsters' are portrayed as people, though (as is shown very effectively here), that seems to stick in my head longer, because these types of monsters look just like everyone else. What started off as just another average, middle-of-the-road story slowly progressed into a darker and darker tunnel... leaving me stunned at the end.
I watched this late at night, and I was supposed to go and check the basement area before bed. After watching this, I skipped it - that's how scary this was. Again, not recommended for sensitive people - it's like drinking an espresso with the coffee grinds sticking to your teeth.

52132,580,1194,"Michael Bay attempts to direct a subtle war film riddled with gunfire and explosions.

13 Hours is easily one of Michael Bay's finest films. The trouble is that he is such a stubborn director, he cannot help but stuff explosions, fire, and bullets anywhere he can to ruin the movie. The dramatic moments actually work well, especially during the few quieter moments. Bay actually finds some neat framing shots and camera angles at times in 13 Hours. It's almost as if he attempted to direct a good film for once. I can applaud his efforts.

Additionally, the first half drags until the deadly rooftop sequences in the second half pick things up. I wish Bay could have tried just a bit harder to make a more concise effort as 13 Hours really is about 20 minutes too long.

I must mention that this is essentially a propaganda movie for not just the American army and CIA, but also a clearly Republican conspiracy film to undermine to Obama administration's war efforts. To be fair, the mistakes make during Benghazi were devastating and avoidable, but little effort is make by Bay to explain these decisions. It's all simplistic and one sided to the last. At least Bay tried to honor these brave soldiers in earnest.

The acting is pretty bare bones. I buy these actors as the characters, but they are all so underwritten and dull, you hardly even make the effort to learn their names.

In all, if you want an entertaining enough war flick from Michael Bay and all that implies, you will get what you paid for, honestly. 13 Hours is not a great film, but it does make for an engaging conflict chronicling the Libyan engagements in Benghazi.

For newbies the premise will be a little weird; through martial art, some people can control one element (Water, Earth, Fire, or Air) and one special person can control all of them. From there just watch the show and be amazed.

This show cleverly introduced Eastern Philosophy to me and many others, how many kids shows can say the smartly introduced children to anything, let alone a complex philosophy?

The characters are some of the most vivid and well written in the entire history of Televison; from a young airbender coping with the horrors of being the last of his kind, to a teenage prince trying (and constantly failing) to restore his honor.

This is an incredible show and I cannot recommend it enough.

52139,5696,1850,"I'm not sure that this should have been placed in the horror file - to me it was more like a 'dark drama' type of film. The plot centers around a woman who's about to have a baby, her meddling mother and her too-skeptical husband. She begins to experience 'disturbances' in her new house - but when she turns to the people closest to her (as most of us would do) for help, they gently chide her and dismiss her concerns as 'pre-birth stress' (including her closest friend). This is pretty much the whole thing - the three go back and forth, each character stubbornly clinging to what they believe is really going on until tragedy hits at the end.
Too many loose ends here; too many questions and not enough explanations at the end. Was there even a spirit in the house at all (if there was then I must have missed them)? What was the history of the house? Why would a good husband (whose wife is 7 months pregnant with their first child) side up with his mother-in-law if his wife was really going through a difficult time? And Walter... what was the point of him being in the story at all, if he was really a fake psychic? To add to the girl's already-overloaded stress levels?
And one more thing. If I was 7 months along, and I had experienced ANYTHING like the lead character did upon moving into a new house, I would be out of there - whether my husband believed me or not. Pack a bag, call a cab - I would gone in a heartbeat. Seriously now: you're about to have a baby (which on its own can be somewhat stressful, due to the  physical changes a woman experiences during pregnancy); you hear strange noises and are creeped out in your new environment, you need to get out of there! The heck with Mom and Sweetheart - you have a child to think about! Too much family drama, and not enough information about the 'ghost' in the house.

52140,157,115,"This is a terrible movie.  It's boring, it's slow and when it's over there's not one memorable scene you can remember. You're waiting the whole film for it to pick up storyline wise but it never does. You early on start to wish you'd watched something else.  Basically it's about an old Texas guy who likes firing his gun in the air, whether he's inside his house or outside whenever he gets mad or upset.  Seems to do so, so it makes him like a big man and in charge of the situation, but just makes him look pathetic.  He's surprised that a female Texas ranger exists and is annoyed that she dares to come onto his property and knock on his door and ask questions about a missing assumed to be murdered teenage victim from some years ago, and yells at his staff and the help whenever she turns up because it's their fault.  The Texas ranger actress doesn't visually sell to the viewer that she's a police officer, her acting isn't great and she does dumb things like drive after a driver who fires a bullet at her car into a dead end quarry that you'd think ambush would be on her mind.  Luckily for her it wasn't on the mind of the dumb thug.  Her car luckily although it looks nothing like a police car, seems to have a bullet proof windshield.  James Franco turns up about a third of the movie in (after a cameo at the start), his presence as an actor stands out amongst the others who don't seem that convincing in their roles.  He has two brothers, one seems to be about twice his age, but then again the father is pretty old so I guess that's possible.

The quality of this movie can be summurised in a scene, there's a Mexican woman who says in Spanish (we read the subtitles), I asked for you (she's talking to the Texas ranger) specifically because you can speak Spanish.  The obese other Texas ranger excuses himself and gets up and leaves the room because he can only speak English and has better things to do.  Then as soon as he's gone, the conversation continues in English.

52225,102,5621,"Agent 007 (Roger Moore) learns that hes on the hit list of the world's most expensive assassin, Scaramanga (Christopher Lee). Traveling from Beirut to Macau, China, to Bangkok, Thailand, he aims to confront the assassin while recovering sensitive solar cell equipment. Herv Villechaize is on hand as Scaramangas little assistant, Nick Nack.

The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) was Moores second outing as Bond. He did 7 films for the franchise in 13 years from 1973-1985. Moores stint is my favorite run in the series with all seven films being kinetic, amusing, scenic and just all-around entertaining. Theres not one clunker in the bunch and they were all profitable at the box office, but this one kinda got lost between the cracks of Live and Let Die (1973) and The Spy who Loved Me (1977).

Director Guy Hamilton made three prior Bond films, Live and Let Die, Diamonds are Forever (1971) and Goldfinger (1964), and wanted 007 to be more rough around the edges in this movie, like he is in Ian Flemings book. As such, Moore's acting seems more ""tough here than his other Bond entrees; for instance, the way he treats Andrea (Maud Adams) in the arm twisting scene. But Moore didn't like playing the character this way and toned it down for the rest of his installments.

Theres picturesque Asian globetrotting, with the Thailand islands being particularly scenic (standing in for Red Chinese waters). On the female front, theres Agent Mary Goodnight played by Britt Ekland, who looks great in a floral bikini during the last reel. Theres also the aforementioned Adams as Andrea and a cameo by Chew Mee. Memorable moments include an entertaining martial arts academy sequence; the amusing return of redneck Sheriff JW Pepper (Clifton James), whos vacationing in Bangkok with his wife; a great car-jumping stunt; and Scaramangas secret solar power plant operation.

The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes and was shot in Thailand (Phang Nga Bay and Bangkok) and Hong Kong/ Macau, with additional work done in England.

""Blue Jasmine"" seemed so funny in trailers when in fact all the funny bits were IN the trailer and the movie was not only a very moving film of a woman's mental descent, Woody Allen didn't even bother to try to make San Francisco worth looking at---as he had for Paris and Rome.

This is not that kind of movie.  That reviewer must have been texting while watching.  This movie is a remarkably gory gothic romance---people don't just die, they get their heads bashed in and you get to watch.  Otherwise, as horror films go---I loved it, right up my alley.

Oh, and there isn't a lot of the romance part either---but it's very gothic.

So, if you're looking for a creepy film with a fantastically atmospheric haunted house, bits of extremely violent gore, and recurrent grotesques as ghostly figures; one that is lavishly filmed (in 70mm no less) for your October viewing, add this to your list, right near ""The Orphanage"".",1535846400,3,id ad film halloween list octob found review said studio emphas horror scene trailer realiti movi gothic romanc horror flick dont hate blue jasmin seem funni trailer fact funni bit trailer movi move film woman mental descent woodi allen didnt even bother tri make san francisco worth look ata pari rome kind movi review must text watch movi remark gori gothic romancepeopl dont die get head bash get watch otherwis horror film goi love right alley cant stand slasher flick dont like film linger give creep lone night dark creaki apart like angel heart one haunt houseghost filmwith ghost monster corp spectr think pirat caribbean oh isnt lot romanc part eitherbut gothic your look creepi film fantast atmospher haunt hous bit extrem violent gore recurr grotesqu ghostli figur one lavishli film 70mm le octob view add list right near orphanag

The possession has all the regular signs we've all seen before, like speaking different languages, aggression, knowing things they shouldn't know..... but then there's some new stuff I've never seen in an exorcist movie before and it's a breath of fresh air in a stale repetitive genre.

52250,1194,426,"This was a good horror film, I rather enjoyed it. The premise, while simple, definitely held my attention with good scares, atmosphere, and the tremendous skill of the two leads. There were, as many critics and reviewers pointed out, more depth to the film than a simple monster flick, as the relationship between the two leads figured a lot into the plot.

Taking place almost entirely on a dark, rainy road deep in the forest, the movie centers on a mother (an abusive, alcoholic woman by the name of Kathy played by Zoe Kazan) and her daughter, choosing to permanently live with her father (the daughter is 10-years old and named Lizzy, played by Ella Ballentine). While driving her daughter through the forest, Kathy hits a wolf. Kathy is injured in the collision and the car damaged and the two managed to call an ambulance and a tow truck.

Things get worse from there, for in the dark rainy woods there is a far worse thing a wolf, and soon everyone involved is in a fight for their lives (with multiple people dying). To say much more is spoiling, but the fight against the monster also involves repairing the relationship between Kathy and Lizzy.

I liked the monster, the atmosphere and tension were first rate, and Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballentine did excellent jobs (especially Ella); if they had not been good the movie wouldnt have worked anywhere near as well as it did. It was literally and figuratively a dark film and in both senses of the word really worked for me. Watch it in a darkened room if you can!

52254,7239,1417,"Welcome to Downton Abbey! If you've had a great day, this will ruin it.

This was well acted but very predictable. I called every new development with 100% accuracy. That's not a good show.

I wasn't crazy about the flogging of ""it's a new world"" concept. It certainly could have been subtle and played out, not spoken by every character over and over ad nauseum. I don't need a flashing billboard to understand a concept.

Speaking of being sick to the stomach, the Mary character made Caligula look cuddly. I don't understand making her as vile as she was - and yet she holds everyone in thrall? Not believable. If the writer thought he was creating a 'heart of gold, but with a tough exterior' character, he missed completely. She had two side:  vicious as a demon, to not quite vicious as a demon. I loathed every scene she was in. She looked like a dumbstruck statue most of the time. Who wants a central character without expression 90% of the time?

There were an incredibly lot of very nasty characters. But even the nicer people were annoying as hell with trying to mess up their lives, the constant self- deprecation, and general foolishness. I couldn't listen to my best friend dither over every decision like that.

The young men were not portrayed well. It was very unrealistic to see then madly in love with people they've seen at maybe two dinners. Everyone of them gets kicked to the curb (despicably by that thug Mary) and every one crawled back for more. Really?

Who could believe that those 3 daughters were raised by the Lord and Lady Graham? The sisters. were all very distasteful. Thank God they killed Sybil off quickly. I wanted to cut my throat listening to her.
Tom Branson tested my patience with 5 season's worth of ""Do I belong here? I do belong here. But do I belong here""?
I couldn't eaten and watched this show.

In short, this ridiculous series was tedious and pointless as a paper cut. Very light on actual story telling. It should have been titled ""Downton Asylum for the Stupid and Self-Defeatingly Insane"".

I really would be shocked if I knew anyone who liked this pap.

Maggie Smith was delightful as ever. What a mismatch

The ""goof not goof"" lengthy explanation of why 2 blue-eyed parents have brown-eyed daughters is the perfect metaphor for this ""unnecessary and pointless"" series.

It's much harder for Keen because she shot the Attorney General, but his last words to her and Harold Cooper were that there was nothing they could do about it. Reddington of course has other ideas and that is to take the fight to the Cabal and in he first half of the season that is just what he & Liz do.

A truce of sorts is reached with the capture and exposing of the Director of the Cabal and Clandestine Services at the CIA. Liz is cleared of all charges except that shooting of AG. She gets 3 years probation but loses her job at the FBI and her ability to carry a gun. It becomes common knowledge who she is (was), a daughter of a Russian spy and now has less anonymity than she had before (because now more people know that she was born to Russians).

As the season progresses Liz we find is pregnant and wants to marry Tom at a church and the wedding is interrupted by a group of 26 people armed to the teeth and being directed with someone like Aram using a defunct satellite network. They fail in their mission to capture Liz whom we find out is the target but wanted alive. A chase ensues and Liz eventually holds up at a club turned emergency hospital. Tom is now a loan parent who wants to avenge his wife's death and at the same time has to take care of the baby who is premature. This is one of the saddest moments of the series. How could the writers do this? What were they thinking?

The next episode is one of the strangest ones in that it's really about Red and what is going on in his mind. That episode ends with Red stumbling across a guy who was using a metal detector to dig up what turns out to be a locket from Liz's mom who supposedly committed suicide on that same beach some 25+ years earlier. What?

Later we learn that Tom and the baby are on their way to meet Liz who is still alive and it was Mr. Kaplan who decided that her commitment was to Liz and her baby, Agnes, ahead of Raymond. We also learn that Tom (who went by the name of Jacob Phelps) has a Mom whom he wanted to kill by the name of Susan Hargrave because she was working for Alexander Kirk who we come to find in the end says that he is Liz's father, Konstatin Rostatov and has both Liz and the Baby who is on the way to him.

52284,505,2915,"fine acting and superb production value; still, this movie attains little beyond propaganda, which in retrospect is too obvious to provide temporary entertainment

the one true part of the movie is the virus. a structure designed to slowly crumble will be rebuilt by the people, not out of complaisance but out of fear of desperation. in the eyes of the people, those who are laid low by fate generally become the Example not the hero. good so far.

but people are not so advanced that they'd All peacefully walk past soldiers who had aimed guns at them only moments before. Even in a less individualistic state, even on behalf of the masses, the masses don't tend towards spontaneous order unless the structure is wiped out, and then order merely grasps at ruins hoping to rebuild the previous structure. it is correct to say people are a part of the infrastructure but incorrect to assume passivity or lack of contrary wills.. inequalities are rendered through biased disenfranchisement and artificially imposed classes; the masses are not hypnotized by their leader so much as by the scapegoat whom they wish to avoid becoming, so the image of an average footman in a revolution as shielded from desperation does not check
....the upshot is that the ""good guys"" in this movie, if accurately portrayed, would not inspire sympathy in audience.

spoiler below

I do appreciate that V's mask is never publicly removed so he's never fully humanized. it's grace despite his rise to fantasy heroism because he still dies before seeing the final act of his performance, and because he dies in a mask he remains an idea --allowing Evy's surprisingly cold speculation at the end: that ""he was [everyone]."" the female character who dies in the medical experiments is fully humanized yet blocked from redress: the foil. the movie somehow avoids choking both martyred-revolutionary characters with fantasy but the same attention was not paid to its overarching logic

at the unmasking, one glimpses familiar faces: we're to think the memory lives on... romantic, but this movie posits that revolution is in the hands of the people and imagery suggests the power of masses; however masses of people who die for a cause mostly die nameless. lucky the revolution itself proves bloodless! a strange sort of senseless fantasy, but propaganda does primarily inspire good feeling. truth gets heavy",1536451200,3,fine act superb product valu still movi attain littl beyond propaganda retrospect obviou provid temporari entertain one true part movi viru structur design slowli crumbl rebuilt peopl complais fear desper eye peopl laid low fate gener becom exampl hero good far peopl advanc theyd peac walk past soldier aim gun moment even le individualist state even behalf mass mass dont tend toward spontan order unless structur wipe order mere grasp ruin hope rebuild previou structur correct say peopl part infrastructur incorrect assum passiv lack contrari will inequ render bias disenfranchis artifici impos class mass hypnot leader much scapegoat wish avoid becom imag averag footman revolut shield desper check upshot good guy movi accur portray would inspir sympathi audienc spoiler appreci v mask never publicli remov he never fulli human grace despit rise fantasi heroism still die see final act perform die mask remain idea allow evi surprisingli cold specul end everyon femal charact die medic experi fulli human yet block

The main story is Daikoku Island erupts and don't you just know it to your amazement a new Godzilla appears. As usual the monster heads to Japan for some quick nourishment and its traditional rampage of what ever city it is near. This Godzilla is meaner looking then the past Godzilla of years gone by. At least with the old version you could bring that one home to the folks and maybe go out on a dinner date. Also, this is the first Godzilla movie in nine years. The last Godzilla movie was the Terror of Mechagodzilla which was released in March 15, 1975. The special effects of this movie are great for the era of that time. Finally, this is the first Godzilla movie since the original back in 1954, that the big guy does not do battle with another monster. The Return of Godzilla or Godzilla 1984 gets an AAAA++++.

My husband's dear friend is a  quadriplegic; he was shot in the line of duty, a NYC Police Officer, 25 years ago when he was 26 years old.  He never once thought of taking his life, never.  He is often in pain, and often develops infections which he is not aware of until they flare up to severe proportions.  But, he perseveres.  And, his wife lovingly cares for him.

""Me before You,"" is a poignant, charming story of a young man who once had it all, a good job, a beautiful girl friend, a full, active life with a lot of friends until he was struck down by a car and left a paraplegic.  He abhors his life now, and is petulant, and morose.  Louisa enters his life, an energetic, chatty, full of life, beautiful young woman who gives his life new meaning.  She takes him on daily outings and eventually on a short vacation.  The two fall in love. She eventually finds out about his plan to end his life with assistance.  Louisa is devastated and cannot accept this decision.

I, too, find this decision harsh, and cannot accept it.  I think of Officer MacDonnell, a NYC Police Officer,  who was a paraplegic and lived his life until it was his time to leave this earth.  He came to the high school where I taught, and our students were so impressed with his talk.  He spoke meaningfully about family, life and his belief in God.  He received a standing ovation.  And I also go back to my husband's dear friend, the quadriplegic, who is still in a wheelchair and will live until God calls him.  I do not agree with the decision that Treynor, the protagonist, made in this film to end his life.  And I'm sure a lot of quadri- and paraplegics will agree with me.  There is a quality of life even in a wheelchair.

Emilia Clarke and Sam Caflin as the protagonists in this film are outstanding.  The supporting cast is also outstanding.",1536796800,5,confin wheelchair parapleg like male protagonist film long day walk run danc husband dear friend quadripleg shot line duti nyc polic offic 25 year ago 26 year old never thought take life never often pain often develop infect awar flare sever proport persever wife lovingli care poignant charm stori young man good job beauti girl friend full activ life lot friend struck car left parapleg abhor life petul moro louisa enter life energet chatti full life beauti young woman give life new mean take daili outing eventu short vacat two fall love eventu find plan end life assist louisa devast cannot accept decis find decis harsh cannot accept think offic macdonnel nyc polic offic parapleg live life time leav earth came high school taught student impress talk spoke meaning famili life belief god receiv stand ovat also go back husband dear friend quadripleg still

52311,3664,1996,"I'm willing to bet Nicolas Winding Pefn was not in his right mind when he created this film.  It's totally insane, offbeat, psychedelic and BORING.  I give it 1 star because of the soundtrack, especially the craft music of Cliff Martinez.  I watched this because it was billed as a horror film.  It wasn't horror...it was HORRIBLE.  The premise is simple and overused.  Young girls aspiring to be models do anything to become rich and famous...even those who are underage.  The younger audience may like this.  I didn't. And, looking at the other reviews, I'm not alone.",1536883200,1,im will bet nicola wind pefn right mind creat film total insan offbeat psychedel bore give 1 star soundtrack especi craft music cliff martinez watch bill horror film wasnt horrorit horribl premis simpl overus young girl aspir model anyth becom rich famouseven underag younger audienc may like didnt look review im alon

The thought for me that something happened off camera just after the seasons start, something drastic. Not wanting to just loose the cost of the up to then investment the directors chopped up and created three confusing and under produced episodes. The believability of the crime is sketchy and the law that is presented is doubtful in its veracity. If you are considering watching this season after viewing the four previous ,sorry don't waste your time. Certainly don't waste your money.

52323,2769,919,"Blake Livelys never really been on my radar in the past.  I knew she starred in the series Gossip Girl (which Ive never watched), is married to Ryan Reynolds, starred in The Age of Adaline and appeared in some internet fashion stories but that was it.  She delivers a strong performance and is more than capable in carrying this thriller from start to finish.  Lively is on camera for the entire film; there are 5 other actors who have about a dozen lines between them and one spunky seagull for her to interact with besides the animatronic/CGI shark.  Its a role similar in some respects to Robert Redfords lost at sea sailor in All is Lost where he is the only person in the entire movie.

  The Shallows is an intense and suspenseful movie that pits an intelligent and resourceful young woman against a great white shark off a lonely Mexican beach.  Nancy takes a break from medical school after the death of her mother and goes on a journey to discover the remote beach where her mom went surfing while pregnant with her.  Nancy finds the secluded beach and hits the waves with only a couple of local surf bums in the area.  The scenery (actually Australia) is spectacular and its an idyllic scene to begin with.  The guys are leaving but she makes the fateful choice to take one more ride when the shark attacks wounding her leg.  She barely escapes to a small rock island where she and a seagull are stranded far from shore with the shark circling.

  The story shows us how a resilient individual can persevere in the face of very daunting odds.  Lively is beautiful and charismatic as she refuses to give up and fights back against the apex predator.  Running about 90 minutes long its just the right length, the situations and her ingenuity feel realistic and you believe these are things you might do if in the same circumstances.  The only weak part is how the shark is dispatched at the end but other than that The Shallows is a thinking viewers shark movie.",1538092800,4,blake live never realli radar past knew star seri gossip girl ive never watch marri ryan reynold star age adalin appear internet fashion stori deliv strong perform capabl carri thriller start finish live camera entir film 5 actor dozen line one spunki seagul interact besid animatroniccgi shark role similar respect robert redford lost sea sailor lost person entir movi shallow intens suspens movi pit intellig resourc young woman great white shark lone mexican beach nanci take break medic school death mother goe journey discov remot beach mom went surf pregnant nanci find seclud beach hit wave coupl local surf bum area sceneri actual australia spectacular idyl scene begin guy leav make fate choic take one ride shark attack wound leg bare escap small rock island seagul strand far shore shark circl stori show u resili individu persever face daunt odd live beauti charismat refus give fight back apex predat run 90
