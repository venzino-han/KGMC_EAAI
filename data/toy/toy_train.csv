She is drawn to tv commercials for cars, computer screens, and (especially) cell phones of any kind.  I thought this might be a distraction from her mommy's phone and my eyeglasses.  So far, it seems to be working. Sometimes, before her mom notices, she holds it in one hand while eating dinner with her free hand just like a teenager.  When I need a moment free of prying hands, I can always hand her her ""phone"" and suggest that she call someone.  She presses every button on the thing, which gratifies her by lighting up and making a lot of noise. She doesn't necessarily keep at it for long periods, but it's enough of a diversion that it moves her on to things other than the book I'm trying to read.

The drill is not as strong as it used to be, even with brand new batteries, so it's hard to drill the screws into the board. It was always hard to screw them out.
My boys don't play with this toy often anymore, and when they do, they just use the drill fit pretend play and not with the board. The colorful screws have become ""trolls"" and are kept in a box separate from the board.
I had much higher expectations for this toy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

So fun! My 3.5 y/o wanted a drill for Christmas, so we got him this one. It's just perfect -- it has the drill and also something to do with it.
The board is smaller than expected but seems like a good size for my toddler.
The sound activated quality is pretty awesome too without being annoying (in general I despise V-Tech-like toys).
My almost 2 y/o is very interested in this toys too but can't press the drill trigger all the way and make it work.
This toy is great for creativity, and eye-hand coordination.
The drill moves forward and backward, and it also has an OFF position. The board can be OFF, lights only, and sound activated lights.
My one complain is that you need to hold the board upsidedown to drill the screws out using gravity.

Boy am I ever glad I did! This robot turned out to be my son's favorite Christmas gift this year. The robot can dance, shoot darts out of it's chest, lights up with very cool colors, plays catchy techno music, and has it easy to use remote control.

476,176,408,"This is a great drone for beginners. It is a ""toy grade"" drone which you can still have a lot of fun with. It's not to ""snappy"" like a mini drone. It is well made and durable. The plastic is soft and pliable (but not too soft). It's also light as a feather. It will take crashes because it is so light. I got it stuck on a branch about 25 feet up. I threw a broom up at it to knock it down to the pavement. I just resumed flying. But I finally got to fly it around today at a soccer field because there is plenty of air space there. The weather has been too cold to do much flying lately. Even today it was only 38F. But I had a good flight with it. The LED's are nice. It was a sunny cloudless day and I can see the LED's which you need for orientation and to see that they are flashing when the battery gets low. They show up even better on an overcast day and at dusk. I added some reflective yellow vinyl to front to make it easier to see anyway.

This drone comes with an extra set of blades, a battery and charger (they all do). The radio Tx is nice. It uses four AA batteries. It has some fake buttons on it, they probably use real buttons there for higher up models with more functions. This drone also includes a detachable camera which I did not bother to use. I really don't care about having a camera, it uses some battery power and will reduce flight time. Plus it's not really good enough for FPV. And lastly, I don't have a smart phone to use for a view screen anyway.

It flies around very nicely and responds to the control inputs well. The instructions have a few flaws. Page 3 which explains the LCD screen has some errors. The screen has 14 items labeled, the explanations stop at 13. 10 thru 13 should be 11 thru 14, 9 & 10 should be the same with the only difference being 9 is for left, 10 is for right.  4 thru 10 show you what position the joy sticks are in as you fly it. You really don't need to see that because you can't take your eyes off the drone when you are flying it. But I tested it by holding the drone in my hand and moving the joy sticks and watching the display. And page 9, step 6 should not be titled ""Headless Function""., It should be titled ""Binding the drone"" because that is what the steps are describing. But it's not too tough to figure out.

All in all, I'm happy with this drone.",1515888000,5,great drone beginn toy grade drone still lot fun snappi like mini drone well made durabl plastic soft pliabl soft also light feather take crash light got stuck branch 25 foot threw broom knock pavement resum fli final got fli around today soccer field plenti air space weather cold much fli late even today 38f good flight led nice sunni cloudless day see led need orient see flash batteri get low show even better overcast day dusk ad reflect yellow vinyl front make easier see anyway drone come extra set blade batteri charger radio tx nice use four aa batteri fake button probabl use real button higher model function drone also includ detach camera bother use realli dont care camera use batteri power reduc flight time plu realli good enough fpv lastli dont smart phone use view screen anyway fli
477,177,409,We haven't had a lot of times to use these yet but what weve seen is good.  This is a higher quality laser tag set made for four players which is what we wanted.  The guns themselves act as the targets for the player so there are no vests to power and wear.  This is great if you worry about vest sizing and saves you in batteries.  Each of these guns do take batteries and are not rechargeable (that would have been an excellent feature).  Again we haven't played them enough to know how badly the guns will drain through batteries.  Right now we are very pleased with the product and would recommend this for anyone looking for a nicer laser tag system.  Also the box it comes in doubles as a nice storage case for the guns.,1515888000,5,havent lot time use yet weve seen good higher qualiti laser tag set made four player want gun act target player vest power wear great worri vest size save batteri gun take batteri recharg would excel featur havent play enough know badli gun drain batteri right plea product would recommend anyon look nicer laser tag system also box come doubl nice storag case gun

637,176,534,"This is a great quad-copter for beginners, although it does not have altitude hold. It has 2 speed levels. The response is good. It has very good LED lighting under it. Orange in front, green for the rear. The remote does have dummy buttons on it for higher up models that will have real buttons there. There is a nice LCD display that tells the status. It also shows the position the joy sticks are in as you move them. But you really can't male use of that information because you can't take your eyes off it when you'r flying. But it can tell you your battery level, radio signal, headless mode on/off and speed level. There is a red power switch on the bottom too. It's easy to assemble, just add the legs and the optional blade guards (aka leaf catchers). Included is one battery and charger too.

This drone does come with a WiFi camera for FPV. But I didn't bother to use it. I don't care about FPV, that's no way to learn to fly anyway. And I don't have a smart phone to use with it either. I like that it is detachable so you can leave it off, save weight (next to nothing anyway) and save battery power for longer flight time.

The functions on it are the usual throttle and direction, 2 speeds, headless or not, 3D flip and trim. The Tx uses for AA batteries.

I can tell you, they both hold the same capacity about 5200-5400 mah, and have the same charge and run time. When I cycling this pack on balance charging, it fills to 5500 mah's.  This battery is almost 50 grams lighter and has a nicer chord for balance charging. I'm overall impressed that it actually holds the capacity that it says it does. That's rare for any Chinese made battery. But if I had to choose between two companies, one who's battery does what it says, or a more expensive one that doesn't, I'll pick the first. I hate batteries that you cannot trust the amperage rating. If the capacity is falsified, who's to say what the real amperage limit is without blowing it up. Go with this one.

The 4 poles for the canopy easily go up and down with a button, easy enough to do one handed. The canopy snaps on to the poles with little snaps, very easy. The canopy can fold together and be put in a little pocket on the side of the wagon. To fold it up was a bit confusing at first. there are instructions on how to fold it, and after a few tries we got the hang of it. There are drink holders on the front of the wagon, great for adult beverages. The side zips down and the manual says the wagon can hold 150lbs but it can hold more than that, so fine for an average adult to sit on, maybe not to be wheeled around on. When it is zipped up there is also a velcro to keep it secure. It has a good padding where the seat is and belts to strap on kids. Can't wait to take this to the zoo!

I called the customer service at leapfrog "" only 90 days warranty"" so your investment is only good for 90 days, plus since I got them from Amazon, they didn't want nothing to do with it.

1117,385,871,"Some of our kids favorite toys are wooden animals.  They like these big sized ones---we have the safari set.  Besides being a puzzle, the kids love stacking and pretend playing with them.  Each piece has facial and body features printed on both sides of the animal.  I wish there was a little more color to them, but the kids don't seem to mind their plain wood simplicity.  Our two year old twins still have trouble putting the animals back together as a single puzzle, so I highly recommend keeping the box for helpful guidance.  Besides being a very sturdy storage unit for all the pieces, correct puzzle assembly is detailed on the bottom of the box.  When they follow the box outline, they have no problems reassembling and it sure makes pick-up an easy process.

Our kids combine this set with another wooden brand,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Janod-Story-Box-Circus/dp/B007JWWTEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Janod Story Box Circus</a>.  Those are more brightly colored, detailed on both sides, but the pieces are much smaller in size.

PROS:
These will stick on any surface. And stick they do. Once stuck, these bad boy's aren't going anywhere unless you want them to.
Vibrant colors and great quality that I expect from Boon.
Easy to clean. I just rinse after each bath and shake all the water out before storing.
Keeps my young toddler's interest for long periods of time. That never happens!

THINGS TO NOTE:
These are not made out of squishy ""jelly-like"" material. These are hard plastic with suction cups attached.
If I stick these on a surface my daughter cannot pull them off herself. As she gets stronger this won't be an issue.
The product images show purple Jellies. In reality they're hot pink.

I highly recommend these Jellies.",1516233600,5,17 month old daughter love hard time transit regular tub terrifi tri everi techniqu final jelli thing got tub absolut love pro stick surfac stick stuck bad boy arent go anywher unless want vibrant color great qualiti expect boon easi clean rins bath shake water store keep young toddler interest long period time never happen thing note made squishi jellylik materi hard plastic suction cup attach stick surfac daughter cannot pull get stronger wont issu product imag show purpl jelli realiti theyr hot pink highli recommend jelli

PROS:
The front and back cover are made out of a thick board. This allows my daughter to easily color on any surface. The cover doubles as a portable table.
Thick paper.
Multiple sheets of stickers.
Each sheet of paper has only one illustration (the backside is blank). Makes saving her masterpieces easier.
Large size (10x10) makes it perfect for toddlers who don't know how to neatly scribble yet.
Simple illustrations promote creativity and help to lessen the overwhelming factor that most commercial coloring books have.

CONS:
None.

Fantastic coloring book. I highly recommend.

On the remote there are two buttons- one that makes it go straight and one that reverses it in an arc, so it's pretty much impossible for the car to get stuck in a corner, which is great. I also thought it was pretty cool that the driver can be taken out and put back on a whim.

So I purchased this with the intentions of upgrading to the Remo as soon I could. Once I opened this drum and gave it a try I was pleasantly surprised. This drum really packs a punch. It has a deep, smooth sound. Aside from looks, there is nothing toy-ish about this drum. It's also constructed out of wood. I've decided to stick with this drum because I can't image that the Remo could be any better than this one. The mallets are well made and safe for my 17-month-old daughter to use unattended, without me worrying. The drum is also easy enough for her to produce great sounds by herself.

I highly recommend this drum if you are looking to introduce your young toddler to music and want them to experience something as realistic as possible (not the annoying plastic baby ""drums"").",1516320000,5,origin want remo floor tom daughter first drum wasnt instock need purchas intent upgrad remo soon could open drum gave tri pleasantli surpris drum realli pack punch deep smooth sound asid look noth toyish drum also construct wood ive decid stick drum cant imag remo could better one mallet well made safe 17monthold daughter use unattend without worri drum also easi enough produc great sound highli recommend drum look introduc young toddler music want experi someth realist possibl annoy plastic babi drum

1680,569,1204,"Istanbul is on its way to becoming a classic resource delivery game, due to its 16-tile variable board, variety of strategic choices, and playing just as well with 2 as it does with 5 players in about 90 minutes.

Each tile represents a unique location that provides a specific action toward getting money, resources, or rubies.  The rubies are the ultimate prize, and the first player with 5 of them wins.  Getting one requires you to leave assistants in multiple locations to perform the actions there, or retrieve them by returning along your path in the reverse order.  You are always free to choose your path, but certain locations reward players who arrive first, if they have the resources they need to take advantage.  You have a limited number of assistants, so choosing when to retrace your steps to take a different path is one of the keys to success in Istanbul.

This is a strategy gamer's game, in the sense that only 3 of the 16 locations involve any luck, and new players are probably going to lose badly to an experienced player.  Once everyone has played a few times, it usually ends with multiple players with 4 rubies.  The rubies are the only victory condition, but there is variety in how and where you get them, and Istanbul always makes you feel like you had plenty of choices, even the ones you immediately regretted.",1516320000,5,istanbul way becom classic resourc deliveri game due 16tile variabl board varieti strateg choic play well 2 5 player 90 minut tile repres uniqu locat provid specif action toward get money resourc rubi rubi ultim prize first player 5 win get one requir leav assist multipl locat perform action retriev return along path revers order alway free choos path certain locat reward player arriv first resourc need take advantag limit number assist choos retrac step take differ path one key success istanbul strategi gamer game sen 3 16 locat involv luck new player probabl go lose badli experienc player everyon play time usual end multipl player 4 rubi rubi victori condit varieti get istanbul alway make feel like plenti choic even one immedi regret

1761,596,1235,"LEGO brand baseplates aren't cheap, however, their quality is unmatched when compared to the knock-offs.

This baseplate is larger than the typical baseplate, which can be both good and bad. If you are amassing a larger scene and you want to connect baseplates, this size can be problematic as it doesnt cleanly fit next to the typical 10 x 10 baseplates. Youll need to have a few 5 x 5 or 5 x 10 plates to make everything fit nicely.

However, if you're looking for an isolated single scene LEGO build, this plate is quite nice as it gives you more real estate to build. It really depends on what your goal is.

As you can see in my images, I was able to make these larger plates fit within my LEGO city, and theyve proven to be very useful as they provide lots of space with which to work.

Overall, this baseplate is great, and you won't find the same quality in the knock-off brands.

Try to find this baseplate when its on sale in order to avoid the retail price of $15.

1811,614,471,"My kids received 2 sets of Magna-tiles for Christmas. We went with Magna-tiles because most of the reviews stated that they had the strongest magnets, and because of that were worth the price. When we opened the box i was surprised at how not strong those magnets were!  And then my 9 year old spend a very frustrating hour trying to build that robot pictured on the example paper and couldn't.... Then I spent half an hour trying to do the same and couldn't... I am an engineer and my opinion is that the magnets are not strong enough to hold the weight of that structure. Maybe earlier when those magnets were stronger... So I went online and started researching it a little more. I came across more recent reviews that state that the magnets indeed got weaker in Magna-tiles. I sent an email to customer service and the answer basically was that the magnets are adequate, they do what they need to do and the robot takes practice. Ok then. I am giving it 3 stars because it is still a good toy but given weaker magnets, very limited shapes and high cost it is simply not worth the higher price anymore. There are other similar toys out there now that are superior to this one.

Update: just took a star away because anything other than 4-6-8 sided prisms collapses. We tried to build a couple of stuctures kids build using playmags and can't: the magnets of the new magna-tiles aren't strong enough.

1840,619,1282,"This Power Wheels Dune Racer was the first electric vehicle our family had gotten in about two years, when we got a John Deere truck that my kids loved riding around a grassy, slightly rough acre of land around the house. They were obviously very excited to see this dune racer arrive and were eager to get it set up for use. While it is not particularly difficult to assemble, the battery takes a very long time to charge. This was the main problem we had with the John Deere vehicle, and ultimately the kids lost interest since the battery ran down fairly quickly and then took an extremely long time to recharge. I am hoping that this battery, which so far seems to have a lasting charge, fares better over time.

It's a sturdy little buggy, and I did not have much safety concern. My two daughters, both petite and ages nine and five, were able to fit easily into the seats. There is no dash, so they have ample leg room and the steering wheel is not uncomfortably close to my eldest girl's chest. It zips along without being too fast, and it worked just fine on the same grassy, slightly rough/uneven ground that we used for the John Deere a couple years ago. So long as the battery lasts, I would recommend this, with the understanding that it will take the battery a long time to charge. My kids love it, and overall, I would say that it is a better vehicle overall than the John Deere truck we had before.",1516406400,5,power wheel dune racer first electr vehicl famili gotten two year got john deer truck kid love ride around grassi slightli rough acr land around hous obvious excit see dune racer arriv eager get set use particularli difficult assembl batteri take long time charg main problem john deer vehicl ultim kid lost interest sinc batteri ran fairli quickli took extrem long time recharg hope batteri far seem last charg fare better time sturdi littl buggi much safeti concern two daughter petit age nine five abl fit easili seat dash ampl leg room steer wheel uncomfort close eldest girl chest zip along without fast work fine grassi slightli roughuneven ground use john deer coupl year ago long batteri last would recommend understand take batteri long time charg kid love overal would say better vehicl overal john deer truck

2098,712,645,"This is a fine game and gameplay is quick.  That aside - I can't explain the glowing reviews, other than to think this game is hitting a niche of non-gamers who are reaching out past their normal comfort zones and thinking this game is just amazing.

If you are a non-gamer, i'm guessing you would love this game, particularly if you are used to Stratego or Blokus.  However, I would also let you know there are dozens and probably 100 2p games that play as quickly and are simply better design and require more strategy.

For gamers - this is part of Uwe's spin into these Tetris-y style games.  Cottage Garden is the better game of those so far (I haven't played Indian Summer though).

The artwork is bland.  The components are typical Mayfair fare - good, not great.  The turns are fast with a do this, or do that, and that's it aspect (which I generally like).  There is moderate strategy in building your quilt, though the bonus is not nearly worth enough to justify.  You are often better off just getting tiles with more buttons, than a tile that actually fits your quilt - really poor design on that.

If you are looking for a 2p quick games in the last few years, I would recommend Raptor, Santorini, Jaipur, Morels, Haleakala, or Cottage Garden before this one.

Again, this is a fine design and there's some uniqueness here, but it simply isn't a 4 or 5 star game.",1516579200,3,fine game gameplay quick asid cant explain glow review think game hit nich nongam reach past normal comfort zone think game amaz nongam im guess would love game particularli use stratego bloku howev would also let know dozen probabl 100 2p game play quickli simpli better design requir strategi gamer part uwe spin tetrisi style game cottag garden better game far havent play indian summer though artwork bland compon typic mayfair fare good great turn fast that aspect gener like moder strategi build quilt though bonu nearli worth enough justifi often better get tile button tile actual fit quilt realli poor design look 2p quick game last year would recommend raptor santorini jaipur morel haleakala cottag garden one fine design there uniqu simpli isnt 4 5 star game

2208,742,1464,"After countless hours of flight simulation (on the phoenix), I thought I was ready for a Hawksky. Nope...total loss of orientation in the sky and blew apart the nose upon impact. Then onto a glider, same thing. Then picked up this little guy with the SAFE technology. Wow, this plane flies stable and slow enough even at 1/4 throttle that I had so much fun. I would suggest buying additional eflite batteries specific to the model as the batteries are the smallest micro connecter type. You could mod the connection but why bother?
I have flown quads and helicopters for years, but never planes, and the SAFE technology that stablizes the plane in flight is incredible. Best to fly this plane with zero wind as it is only a few ounces in weight and the slightest breeze pushes it around. Battery lasted a good 10 minutes at a slower speed with probably time to spare based on how quickly the battery recharged. I was able to bind this plane with a DXE ( that came with the Apprentice 15e) and also a DX6 on the 1st attempt. There are plenty of videos on youtube about everything for reference.  Hand launch at full throttle was easy, and landing was even easier, about as soft as a balloon drooping from the ceiling and hitting carpet.
 I'd highly recommend this plane over any other as a 1st plane with or with out any experience. Just keep it away from trees (learned the hard way).

My almost 2yr old became VERY frustrated right off the batt(and shes a very smart, super easy going and laid back toddler too-so it was surprising)! The coins were difficult to put inside of their designated spots(getting jammed or stuck often...even when I did them myself they did) it was also very confusing and frustrating for her bc the 3 sets of colored coins HAVE to go into a specific slot, u can not just drop the coins into the slots at random or as u choose, so after figuring that out...that was the biggiest dissapointment for me cause I knew that was not what I was looking for or wanted in this specific type of toy geared for toddlers. The drawer that comes out is super small and cheap. The 2 chunky different sized credit cards that also come w/this were just dumb as it was, let alone  that apparently they are NEEDED in order to open the cash register drawer. It was weird. Didnt really make a ton of sense even to me... so, I totally get why she would be just as disappointed and frustrated as I was.

Its proving to be a great learning activity as every time she pulls off a sticker she tells me what it is or asks if she didn't know. It helps them associate what animals belong to which habitat in addition to learning what the habitats themselves are.

2367,806,1545,"I bought this for my 4 year old niece who loves doing creative projects. It looked really cheap when I got it, like a dollar store item, but my niece enjoyed putting the stickers in place. That part is easy to do if the child follows the outline or has a little guidance. The stickers though tend to dry out and shrivel or even fall off the pane after only a few weeks. My niece had hers on her bedroom wall and was disappointed to see a sticker fall off.

Simply piece it together and put it around your standard size dartboard. What worked best for me was putting 3 sections together, and then attaching the last one when the others were already around the dartboard. Then just push it back so it is flush with your wall. The round appearance compliments my Viper board.

It has already stopped a few stray throws that would have put holes in my masonry. It will also keep your dart tips from getting damaged if you have a concrete wall, so that further protects your investment. Get the Defender. You wall (and your darts) will thank you.

My only complaint is they do not fit in the box unless you keep a lot of the pieces together.  The other foam puzzle we have came in a bag so the pieces could all be disconnected and put away, ready to go for next use.  With these we have to keep them in chunks b/c the box is tight, which means that when it's time to do the puzzle we have to first take everything apart.

It's not the same shade of green as the previous green colored LEGO baseplate. See images. With my first image, on the left is the new green and on the right is the previous green. If you have several of the previous green LEGO baseplates, then you'll be quickly disappointed when you compare the new with the old.

Overall, its LEGO quality which is always top notch. Make no mistake, this baseplate will do anything and everything you'd expect out of a baseplate. Additionally, if you don't have any of the previous green colored baseplates, then you won't know the difference in color.

My only complaint is they do not fit in the box unless you keep a lot of the pieces together.  The other foam puzzle we have came in a bag so the pieces could all be disconnected and put away, ready to go for next use.  With these we have to keep them in chunks b/c the box is tight, which means that when it's time to do the puzzle we have to first take everything apart.

2756,947,1721,"Great little puzzle.  The puzzle is ""mini"" when put together - 6"" X 6"" but the pieces are typical of an adult jigsaw puzzle.  The colors are rich and there are shimmer elements on the mermaid.  My 3.5 year old was very excited to put it together.  She was able to complete it with some help.

This would be a good puzzle for on the go or to keep some around as gifts.  From a practical perspective, I would cut out the reference picture and put the contents in a ziplock if I decide to put it in the diaper bag.  The 3 inch cube is a cute package but is only half full of the puzzle pieces.

I think my 3.5 year old is just the right age to start working with these puzzles and will enjoy them for some time to come.

Pros:
- Folds down and into provided bag for easy storage
- soft mesh and soft sides mean I don't have to worry about him hurting himself on it
- big enough adults can sit in and play with the kids
- the opening at the top makes it easy to put balls back in (I throw them from across the room lol)
- good quality material, no rips or tears yet

Cons:
- the door is a little too close to the ground so balls come out the door easily
- there is a door you can roll down to Cover the doorway but it doesnt seem to stick well with just the one piece of Velcro
- since it is so soft and formless my kid likes to try to push on the sides and then sort of tip it on its side and crawl through the top opening instead of the door",1516838400,4,great bought 1 year old birthday he still use 18 month hasnt gotten bore pro fold provid bag easi storag soft mesh soft side mean dont worri hurt big enough adult sit play kid open top make easi put ball back throw across room lol good qualiti materi rip tear yet con door littl close ground ball come door easili door roll cover doorway doesnt seem stick well one piec velcro sinc soft formless kid like tri push side sort tip side crawl top open instead door

2928,811,1721,"This is a well designed puzzle and package. It is easy to store and carry and would make a great addition in a gift bag. The pieces themselves are not flimsy like some economic small-packaged puzzles. The Petit Collage 24 Pieces Puzzle is a good quality that will hold up to eager little fingers. The colors and image pattern are bright and bold, making it the appropriate challenge level for a preschooler. I think the fairy image in her magical environment is appealing and well designed. The use of primary and tertiary color placement makes it a good visual exercise that is not overwhelming, but certainly not too easy for the suggested age level. My wife and I used to make puzzles with our daughter when she was a toddler and preschooler, and doing so forged some of her favorite memories as a young child. When she saw this little box, it made her smile and reflect on her puzzle days. Putting a puzzle together is a timeless activity that makes kids feel great when they finish them. For the price point and convenience, you can't go wrong with this magical little timeless toy.

3004,1030,1282,"My grandchildren LOVE this Power Wheels Dune Racer! This is by far the best Power Wheel vehicle we have had for our grandchildren. I received this item for my almost 3 year old grandson and almost 5 year old grandaughter. The size works equally well  for both of them to ride comfortablely with room to spare. Some of the highlights on assembly and riding:

Assembly:

Assembling the car took my son a little over an hour with some assistance from another adult. The instructions themselves are clear to read and easy to follow. At one point, you need to flip the car on its side to attach the drive shaft and that is where we needed the other adult. All but one tool is included in the kit and it is easy to find the tool, screws or car piece that you need which coordinates with that step in the directions. One area of frustration while assembling was the front license plate, it is hard to line up the plate with the precut holes in the car so that took a few attempts before getting it right. We also had to find a deeper screwdriver for this part to ensure the screw was all the way in and tight. Other than that, assembly was very smooth and moved along quickly. There was one piece that came broken out of the box in the gear shift area. but that does not impact performance, just frustrating to the parent.

Final Assembled Product:

One huge improvement on this particular Power Wheel vehicle that is different from our other two (we have 5 grandchildren and  we have the jeep, and a motorcycle that they all use in rotation) is the battery storage. I have included a picture for your reference. This new storage access area is great and such a welcome improvement over other models. The battery tucks in nicely and door closes keeping the kids from accessing it while they are playing with it.

The open seat design  allows for my older grandchildren, ages 6 and 8, to also be able to fit comfortably with some knee bend. The steering wheel is far enough out that all the children can sit under the wheel and steer comfortably.  Gear shift is easy to move, even my youngest grandson can easily control moving front and back and quickly learned how to do this. As a grandparent, I love the new lock that comes on to control the dune buggy speed. A screw needs to be taken out for the dune buggy to reach top speeds. This allows me to safely ensure that my youngest grandson can't accidentally put in high gear and move faster than he can handle. On the other hand, when the older riders are in the car, I can remove it and they can drive faster.

The dune buggy steers well and takes corners nicely without the wheels spinning. We have a light dusting of snow on the ground right now so we couldn't test on grass but on the sidewalk, light snow covered ground and driveway it drove great. The wheels are a bit wider than our other models so they seemed to control the terrain better.

We are very happy with this product and would recommend for other parents/grandparents looking to invest in a powerwheel.",1516924800,5,grandchild love power wheel dune racer far best power wheel vehicl grandchild receiv item almost 3 year old grandson almost 5 year old grandaught size work equal well ride comfort room spare highlight assembl ride assembl assembl car took son littl hour assist anoth adult instruct clear read easi follow one point need flip car side attach drive shaft need adult one tool includ kit easi find tool screw car piec need coordin step direct one area frustrat assembl front licens plate hard line plate precut hole car took attempt get right also find deeper screwdriv part ensur screw way tight assembl smooth move along quickli one piec came broken box gear shift area impact perform frustrat parent final assembl product one huge improv particular power wheel vehicl differ two 5 grandchild jeep motorcycl use rotat batteri storag includ pictur refer new storag access

3281,596,1039,"Wonderful set.

This set is top notch. Not only do you get the opportunity to build several different variations, you get a lot of LEGO pieces for a relatively good price. If you are able to find this set for retail or below, you'll be in great shape when it comes to the piece/price ratio. I do, however, believe this set is retired and you may have a hard time finding this set for retail price or below.

There are two minifigs with this set and lots of room for imagination and creativity. Check out my images to see how this set looks in a LEGO city scene. Additionally, check out the inside of the deli as there is plenty of detail to go around.

Overall, I put a strong recommendation behind this set and think it will be a hit with LEGO fans young and old alike.

If my review helped to inform you, then please click 'yes' below. If you have any questions, don't hesitate.

3422,1190,151,"The guards arrived on-time and in good condition. I also have the original DJI non-removable guards but I bought these because I could not fit the drone in my backpack unless I removed the guards. Installing the DJI guards requires you to unbolt 16 small screws. The removable guards come off in 2 seconds, yet stay on firmly. I found the DJI guards to be made of better quality plastic, stiffer/stronger but the Summitlink guards did the job. One thing I didn't like about them is they had a ton of flashing. For those that don't know flashing is extra plastic that squeezes out between the mold halves when the parts are made. This is due to poorly made molds or worn out molds. The flashing was mostly a cosmetic issue but some of it did interfere with the on/off process and I had to remove it by hand. The flashing was pretty much everywhere the mold halves met and in many instances sharp. So I ended up scraping all the flashing off. Another thing to consider was that the replacement screws are longer (due to the extra thickness of the snap on mechanism) and do add extra weight far out on the ends of the drone. I did not have the time to measure the actual weight difference or to see if this had any measurable effect on handling or battery runtime, but the extra weight is probably negligible. For the price I find them acceptable and perform the function they were designed for (keeping the props from hitting obstacles).",1517184000,3,guard arriv ontim good condit also origin dji nonremov guard bought could fit drone backpack unless remov guard instal dji guard requir unbolt 16 small screw remov guard come 2 second yet stay firmli found dji guard made better qualiti plastic stifferstrong summitlink guard job one thing didnt like ton flash dont know flash extra plastic squeez mold halv part made due poorli made mold worn mold flash mostli cosmet issu interfer onoff process remov hand flash pretti much everywher mold halv met mani instanc sharp end scrape flash anoth thing consid replac screw longer due extra thick snap mechan add extra weight far end drone time measur actual weight differ see measur effect handl batteri runtim extra weight probabl neglig price find accept perform function design keep prop hit obstacl

UPDATE: Ive had to remove a star due to blindingly incompetent assembly/design I found out today. The machine still works, but it won't if I cant find the patience to reinstall the entire front face (including bubble circle assembly) because NOTHING IS HOLDING IT ON. They do realize this product is made for kids and that they may, in fact, want to touch it if given the chance, right? Id understand if it were clipped in for easy access to cleaning, but theres no clip, no tension, no nothing making sure the face stays on!

After seeing the other reviews photos, I felt I should post on the newer design I received. Photos don't do it justice so see end of the video for bubble output - its impressive!

Things you should know:
- Buy an additional bottle immediately, as the first bottle WILL run out in a matter of about 5 minutes. Its a no-joke bubble machine! Thank goodness our local store had a huge bottle in the middle of winter or my kids would have been seriously ticked off.

- As stated above...TONS of bubbles! So much so, I carpeted the floor of the kitchen in bath towels.

- It isn't as tippy as the older version, but still something you want to keep out of reach of the kiddos. Top-mounted batteries are probably the cause, and, Im sure, the reason for the redesign with the heavier plastic on the bottom. I cant blame them, it wouldnt be pertinent to mount them on the bottom where they're susceptible to leakage. Speaking of...

- It LEAKS! Not much, but it seems to be an unavoidable hazard. We aren't talking a bottle a minute but enough to necessitate protection underneath.

- It can tip and not be irreparably damaged! As I say in the video, Ive been through my share of these over the years, other brands, that could not survive being tipped. If there was any solution in it, it would infiltrate the motor and render it unusable. This one takes it like a champ!

Tip 1: If your bubble machine suddenly stops producing and is more spitting solution out, run water through it until almost all the bubbles dissipate. Then refill and it will work good as new. Sometimes dried solution clogs the prongs and solution cant adhere properly.

Tip 2: If you're going to use an empty water or soda bottle for more solution, tape the unit down, or push into some clay/Play Doh on a plate to hold it in place, or you're going to end up with a tipped bubble machine.

I rely heavily on real, unbiased reviews and am hoping to provide the same.

3733,1085,2090,"Ok, I love this quadcopter. The color red makes it easier to see for one thing, but the design of this one looks so cool. It has a low profile because of the landing gear. Yes, I still use landing gear and prop guards. The technology on the HS200 is more advanced than the other quads I have. For example, the controller is digital and it tells you which speed mode you are in, versus other remotes that beep one or more times telling you which speed you're in. By having it tell you digitally, you won't forget how many beeps you just heard. Thats just a better way to let you know what speed you're set at. Another great thing is how to calibrate the quad. You just press and long hold a button on the remote and it recalibrates. Other drones require you to position the joysticks a certain way, which often times results In accidentally starting the motors. The altitude hold works really well on the HS200. For me, altitude hold is a must. Makes controlling the drone much simpler. I give this drone 5 stars because there isn't anything I don't love about it.
Holy Stone is a great company to deal with too. They will always answer any email questions you have!",1517270400,5,ok love quadcopt color red make easier see one thing design one look cool low profil land gear ye still use land gear prop guard technolog hs200 advanc quad exampl control digit tell speed mode versu remot beep one time tell speed your tell digit wont forget mani beep heard that better way let know speed your set anoth great thing calibr quad press long hold button remot recalibr drone requir posit joystick certain way often time result accident start motor altitud hold work realli well hs200 altitud hold must make control drone much simpler give drone 5 star isnt anyth dont love holi stone great compani deal alway answer email question

The music on this toy is much more enjoyable than the sounds on the rainforest one. And I like that it has to be started by baby touching it. The rainforest one did not and it kept going for a long time without anything touching it. However, the rest of the toys on this one keep minimal attention of baby. He was not much interested in them. The sun toy is so stiff he could not do anything except pull himself up on it. I actually tried to remove ours and it broke off into the hole it was attached in. The many height settings are nice but unnecessary. The other jumperoo had only 3 settings but met his needs just as long. He is short for his age but is now 14 months old and when I put him in this his feel still do not reach on the highest of settings. He stopped sitting in this around 10 months old but he will come up to it and play with the piano still to this day. The seat on this jumper is much more shallow than the other one that we have.

3829,1311,732,"Our household is on our second generation of Thomas fans, and this support structure is an exceptional addition to our tracks.  With two sets, you can set up a double hill with plenty of opportunity to create tracks that cross under and over.  Be aware that this set needs ascending tracks, and NONE come in the box.  I found a pack of eight ascending tracks at a great price (link provided).  I especially like that, if you stack the supports to make the middle of the hill double-high, the supports click together for stability.  The other positive in design is that there is a support rest for the ascending tracks, so they don't slip off.  I've included a picture of a very simple set-up that uses two sets of supports and two sets of ascending tracks going ""east/west"", and a third set of ascending tracks going ""north/south"" through the middle level.  As you can see, Gordon and all the similarly-sized Thomas friends glide easily under the support tower.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ORBRIUM-Toys-Wooden-Railway-Ascending-Tracks-Pack-of-8-Compatible-with-all-major-wooden-railways-including-Thomas-Brio-Chuggington-Imaginarium/dp/B01MSD02VV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ORBRIUM Toys Wooden Railway Ascending Tracks, Pack of 8 Compatible with all major wooden railways including Thomas, Brio, Chuggington, Imaginarium</a>",1517356800,5,household second gener thoma fan support structur except addit track two set set doubl hill plenti opportun creat track cross awar set need ascend track none come box found pack eight ascend track great price link provid especi like stack support make middl hill doublehigh support click togeth stabil posit design support rest ascend track dont slip ive includ pictur simpl setup use two set support two set ascend track go eastwest third set ascend track go northsouth middl level see gordon similarlys thoma friend glide easili support towernbspa datahookproductlinklink classalinknorm hreforbriumtoyswoodenrailwayascendingtrackspackof8compatiblewithallmajorwoodenrailwaysincludingthomasbriochuggingtonimaginariumdpb01msd02vvrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieutf8orbrium toy wooden railway ascend track pack 8 compat major wooden railway includ thoma brio chuggington imaginariuma

It took a couple hours including breaks and was no harder than your standard Ikea type build. The color of the screws does matter as there are brown ones for use on outside pieces and silver for inside pieces, so be aware of that! I personally don't care so I used them by their designated letter and not by color. This will definitely last a long time and I am very pleased with the quality for the cost. All the doors open and close solidly and the knobs click when you turn them. The sink will probably end up getting glued on simply because it's meant to come out to wash it but I would rather it didn't.

Some advice: have a 2nd pair of hands to help you if you can so you are not struggling to hold pieces while putting them together and lay out all your pieces in numerical order BEFORE you start (makes it sooo much easier to find what you are looking for).",1517356800,5,kitchen perfect everi kitchen look look like would small afraid 3yr old son would grow way fast took coupl hour includ break harder standard ikea type build color screw matter brown one use outsid piec silver insid piec awar person dont care use design letter color definit last long time plea qualiti cost door open close solidli knob click turn sink probabl end get glu simpli meant come wash would rather didnt advic 2nd pair hand help struggl hold piec put togeth lay piec numer order start make sooo much easier find look

3913,1332,191,"An adorable little book! I bought it for my 8-month-old son for Christmas. He likes books - he likes flipping through the pages, chewing on them, etc. So I thought something like this would be a hit. It's not his favorite toy, but he does play with it.

The drill barely has any power even with brand new fresh alkaline batteries. It will not screw the screws in. We had to screw them all by hand, which defeats the purpose of this toy.

The only thing I can think of doing is finding some clear glue to press each and every little sticker back on- what a headache. I had to call each grandma up and warn them this might happen to theirs.

4277,569,2287,"Not for everyone. Fairly easy to play, but it's not a ""gateway game"" for novice board gamers. Not for those who don't like co-operative play, story-driven progress, or the medieval high-fantasy theme. To fully enjoy Legends of Andor, you should probably be willing to imagine yourself ""in it"" in a way similar to playing a pen-and-paper RPG. I actually don't always like those, but I love Legends of Andor.

Nearly all of the games that I own have a similar mechanic of ""Choose the action(s) you will take, and then something bad will happen"" either after each player's turn, or after all players have taken their actions. Andor is different in that the additional challenges are triggered at specific times based on the number of enemies you defeat, or by completing story objectives, and not always by everyone running out of actions for the day.

The double-sided board is BIG (Ticket-to-Ride-sized), and richly illustrated in an overland fantasy style on one side, and dark forest/dwarf caverns on the other. The heroes, allies, and monsters are all sturdy cardboard with color-coded plastic bases. Maybe not as impressive as resin-molded, but they're colorful, cost-effective, and still look great. Wooden dice, individual player equipment/stat boards (all players can choose male or female heroes - no stat differences), and a merchant's board with tokens for bows, falcons, helmets, potions, etc. High production value for the cost of the game, and there's a bit of a ""wow"" factor, just looking at it halfway through a scenario.

The insanely brief rulebook is really just a reference sheet for clarification of game terminology. The rules themselves are simple and explained as you play, revealed on cards as you progress through the story along with the tasks you must complete to succeed. Everything is tightly calibrated, from the numbered spaces on the board (which seem random until you figure out how they affect movement of monsters and placement of items), to the timing of the new adventure cards for each scenario. I'm accustomed to trying to learn all the rules from a 20-page booklet before playing a new game. The way Andor does it is unconventional, yet perfectly suited for a game of its type.

It's also deceptively difficult after the initial quick-play walkthrough. You'll soon find that killing every monster in sight is a good way to fail your other objectives. Random event cards and placement of fog tokens can vary the challenge. Sometimes the dice just don't roll your way, and you end up using more actions than you wanted to defeat a monster or complete an objective, which could eventually lead to failing a scenario.

I wouldn't say this game has a lot of replay value in the traditional sense. Once you figure out how to complete a scenario, you can pretty much always do it, barring some ridiculous bad luck. Typically this would be a reason for me to knock a star off my rating, even if the game was great fun. You replay Legends of Andor for the same reasons you might reread a book you really enjoy.  For someone like me who collects and plays hobby board games, Legends of Andor is an heirloom game. It inspires wonder in my kids now, and I can imagine my son pulling it out at some Thanksgiving far in the future and saying, ""Whoa, Dad, do you remember this? I can't believe you still have this."" It surely does not have universal appeal, but games like this (and also Mice and Mystics) allow you to interact with a story in a way that some video games get right, and some RPGs do effectively with physical components like miniatures and landscapes. It's not a top 10 favorite, but like my Buck Rogers metal lunchbox from 2nd grade, there is undoubtedly something sentimental about it.",1517616000,5,everyon fairli easi play gateway game novic board gamer dont like cooper play storydriven progress mediev highfantasi theme fulli enjoy legend andor probabl will imagin way similar play penandpap rpg actual dont alway like love legend andor nearli game similar mechan choos action take someth bad happen either player turn player taken action andor differ addit challeng trigger specif time base number enemi defeat complet stori object alway everyon run action day doublesid board big tickettorides richli illustr overland fantasi style one side dark forestdwarf cavern hero alli monster sturdi cardboard colorcod plastic base mayb impress resinmold theyr color costeffect still look great wooden dice individu player equipmentstat board player choos male femal hero stat differ merchant board token bow falcon helmet potion etc high product valu cost game there bit wow factor look halfway scenario insan brief rulebook realli refer sheet clarif game terminolog rule simpl explain play reveal card progress stori along task must complet succeed everyth tightli calibr number

He loves to push his trains back and forth through the tunnel and has great fun watching them fly through the door. One issue we've had is that sometimes he tries to push them backwards before they've completely exited, which causes the door to get stuck. So if you've got a really young one I wouldn't recommend this piece until they're older, or leave the door off until they're able to get the hang of it (the swinging door does not come attached, you pop it in).

I wanted something that didn't waste an entire tub of water for a 20 lb human and something that wouldnt be too slippery for him. The tub dam seemed like a good option, it was just expensive and didn't get great reviews. I got the Summer Infant seat and he HATED it. I put a towel down in the bath, he hated that. I finally decided to get this, even though I thought it was kind of ridiculous. But guess what? My son LOVES it. He will take 20+ min baths now which is a lifesaver for me because he is happy and entertained with a few toys in the tub before bed when he is normally cranky. It is comfortable and supportive, even if your baby isn't a super stable sitter. I love that it uses only a limited amount of water. Its really easy to fill up and has a little drain at the bottom, as well as a heat sensor to tell you if the water is too hot. There is also a suction cup on the bottom to prevent the ducky tub from sliding around in the regular tub. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is a bulky tub to have just sitting around and its not the kind of thing you want to inflate and deflate every night.",1517788800,5,one product simpl yet geniu son outgrew newbornbabi tub start look altern want someth didnt wast entir tub water 20 lb human someth wouldnt slipperi tub dam seem like good option expens didnt get great review got summer infant seat hate put towel bath hate final decid get even though thought kind ridicul guess son love take 20 min bath lifesav happi entertain toy tub bed normal cranki comfort support even babi isnt super stabl sitter love use limit amount water realli easi fill littl drain bottom well heat sensor tell water hot also suction cup bottom prevent ducki tub slide around regular tub thing dont like bulki tub sit around kind thing want inflat deflat everi night

My 11 month old daughter loves to play with my phone, so I thought I would get her this because it looks just like a phone and it says it's a touch screen and it can be swiped to different screens. However, the plastic toggle that new baby has to slide across to get from one screen to the next by the way there's only two screens. For some reason I thought there were more screens and more features. Anyways, the toggle that baby has to slide from side to side is very hard to maneuver even for me! my baby was getting very frustrated as she could not get it to move. and then there is a touch screen itself you can touch the screen but you have to push it really hard I thought it would be more sensitive but it is not! Also the phone is pretty big and hard for my baby to hold with her small hands it says it's for 6 to 36 months, but I don't think a six-month-old baby could manipulate this toy! I'm sure when she gets older she will like it more but I was hoping this would be a winner because she's always wanting to play with my phone and knows how to swipe it and unlock it and sometimes changes settings and delete things LOL so I thought I would get her this so she would have her very own phone. I should have done my research a lot of people said it was a good toy but I found one that is an actual touch swipe phone and has so many more features! It is more pricey sure, but it has tons of features compare to this one! I was reading the Box on the picture of this VTech phone and it made it seem like it had more features than actually does! It allows you to save your home phone number for what reason I do not know! I guess maybe just to teach your baby your phone number for emergencies but I mean that's kind of a long way until that is going to be memorized! speaking of saving the home phone number I set it up to save my number and when you push the button that has a house on it it's supposed to say call home and then say the number but now when I push it it just makes a funny noise or play the song and doesn't say the number anymore and I haven't did anything to delete the number. will most likely be sending this back and purchasing the other phone. not too sure yet, I will give it another couple weeks to see if she gets interested in it because as I've learned with my child being that she is my first, she will not be interested in new toys until she gets a little bit older and then she loves them so this might be one of those toys so I will hold off on sending it back. It's not a bad price and I usually love all VTech toys. I really had high hopes for this one being that my baby as I stated before loves to play with my phone so I thought this was perfect! Great idea like I said I would recommend it for older babies toddlers my baby is almost a year old and her hands are so small that he can't really manipulate the toggle button at all and it just frustrates her more than anything and doesn't keep her attention even when I do it for her she does not seem interested. sorry for the grammar and the run-on sentences I apologize for that! I will try to upload a video on my review to show you how hard it is to talk go back and forth and some of the functions of it. Not sure if it will actually go through because I tried putting a video on a review before and it did not show up even though I uploaded it and everything but that's another situation LOL. If my baby comes to Lovelace toy and figures it out, I will update this review as I think it's only fair to do so! This is just my opinion and my experience! I know every baby is different so ultimately it is up to you obviously I just wanted to give my review so that you have a little bit of a heads up that I wish I had!",1517875200,2,div idvideoblockr12tq8nqggsr0i classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesie1d2ymwy4smp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi81dtgw1w3yspng classvideoslateimgurlnbspth idea good execut poor 11 month old daughter love play phone thought would get look like phone say touch screen swipe differ screen howev plastic toggl new babi slide across get one screen next way there two screen reason thought screen featur anyway toggl babi slide side side hard maneuv even babi get frustrat could get move touch screen touch screen push realli hard thought would sensit also phone pretti big hard babi hold small hand say 6 36 month dont think sixmonthold babi could manipul toy im sure get older like hope would winner she alway want play phone know swipe unlock sometim chang set delet thing lol thought would get would phone done research lot peopl said good toy found one actual touch swipe phone mani featur
4646,1571,340,"I am the parent of two kids (one in particular) that love to play board games. All the time. Of all kinds.

Sometimes this is amusing, but sometimes it can get rather dreary. Often, the games that they want to play don't have enough strategy and mental work to them to be interesting to an adult. Either that or the games are exceedingly short and repetitive (or long and interminable).

But this gamethis game is an absolute *blast*. I say that as an adult, It has a defined length (as many turns as the number of pieces) that turns out to be just about rightsomewhere between 15 and 25 minutes. And it is simple and intuitive to learn, and colorful, toogreat for kids. And it is also very much a strategy game and also a game that relies on skill (visual and tactical)great for adults.

It fits all of our puzzles well except some of the chunky puzzles--and it's not because of the height (heck, you just skip a row), but because of the shape of the rack and placement of puzzle pieces on the board. The rods on the side slant inwards, so if a chunky puzzle pieces is in the top 2-3 square inches of the puzzle, it either won't go in all the way, or it can be forced a bit but then it warps the rest of the rack so the rest of the puzzles don't fit well. We have 3 chunky puzzles and only one causes this issue, but that 1 is enough to knock off a star; I think a storage puzzle rack should be compatible with all of M&D's smaller sized puzzles.

Handy to cut the paper using the edge of the wood on the top. She uses all the time. Good teaching board as well. I was worried about the screws since I read all the reviews and some people complain about the screws and even suggested buying separate ones but the screws inside the box was well made shiny ones which makes us very happy not that difficult to set it up immediately my daughter jump into it. There is no chalk I need to buy separately later when she grows up more. It is bit high to utilize whole space on the paper since my little girl is so young to reach high but she still loves to use it to draw anyway 1/3 lower height.

I was happy with the product and the color I got the pink one which is an exclusive color. It has a lot of different features such as a little spinning wheel that has pictures of animals and every time you spin it it names the animal and makes the sound of the animal. Your baby can also Babble into the microphone and it amplifies their voice. But they really have to put their mouth right by it in order to be Amplified. When your baby shakes the microphone it has some sound effects which I thought was pretty neat she loves it because she's always shaking all her toys! It has over 60 songs, sounds, melodies and phrases which is really neat! It has the four buttons one is a white dog one plays music when plays the drums and the other one plays the piano and it names all of these to teach your baby. My daughter is at the age where she just loves to talk and talk and talk so this was a great buy for her and it's easy for her to hold as it has a small part where the baby can hold it very easily, when I saw it online I wasn't sure if she would be able to hold it easily but when I received it I was relieved to find out that it would she would be able to pick up and hold it very easily! I love all VTech toys, they are very good quality and very affordable! It also has to sing along songs and 15 melodies so a lot of different music and sounds to keep your baby interested and amused! I like the little ribbons that are on either side of the microphone, just different textures and colors babies love to feel and look at! I wish I had a volume setting usually most of VTech toys have two different volume settings this one does not it just has an off switch, the microphone switch and the learning switch which has a picture of a book. But that's definitely not a deal-breaker! I would definitely recommend this toy it says it's for 3 months and over but I don't think my daughter would have been interested in it at 3 months to be honest but each baby is different.",1517875200,5,div idvideoblockrglnmx9n5n540 classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesie1x2bhdsydusmp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi81aprc47kbspng classvideoslateimgurlnbspi bought 11 month old daughter got today cours play around see happi product color got pink one exclus color lot differ featur littl spin wheel pictur anim everi time spin name anim make sound anim babi also babbl microphon amplifi voic realli put mouth right order amplifi babi shake microphon sound effect thought pretti neat love she alway shake toy 60 song sound melodi phrase realli neat four button one white dog one play music play drum one play piano name teach babi daughter age love talk talk talk great buy easi hold small part babi hold easili saw onlin wasnt sure would abl hold easili receiv reliev find would would abl pick hold easili love vtech toy good qualiti afford

4794,1620,2435,"This didn't quite last too long.  The red sword could not even survive the packaging (not to be confused with shipping; it was fine during shipping because the box was unscathed) as evidenced by the snapped core within the foam.  This resulted in the red sword not being able to support its own weight, and it went limp when held horizontally despite its fluffy light weight (see pic).  If you push the tip of these swords against a solid surface (see last pic), you can see how far the core goes, as the tip because it bends where the core does not support it.  This is highly likely to lead to the outer foam rupturing at the point where the harder core ends with heavier use.  The two swords, both red and blue were held together with a rubber band that left a permanent line of demarcation on both swords.  This was because the foam is made of a soft and squishy material, and the core is more rigid, but also made of a more brittle plastic.  Both are probably made from cheap material (very cheap), so obviously it is of a lower quality than the more expensive foam swords on the market.  At least the handles seem to be made of a slightly better firmer material and are perhaps the best aspect of these swords.  When clashed together in battle, though, these swords hurt less than the more expensive foam melee weapons.  This is another plus aside from the affordability and handles.  It is anticipated that the blue sword will not survive since its counterpart is already busted from within.  I cannot recommend the purchase of these, but will return to update this and possibly add star(s) if I find that the blue sword markedly outlives my expectations.",1517875200,1,didnt quit last long red sword could even surviv packag confus ship fine ship box unscath evidenc snap core within foam result red sword abl support weight went limp held horizont despit fluffi light weight see pic push tip sword solid surfac see last pic see far core goe tip bend core support highli like lead outer foam ruptur point harder core end heavier use two sword red blue held togeth rubber band left perman line demarc sword foam made soft squishi materi core rigid also made brittl plastic probabl made cheap materi cheap obvious lower qualiti expens foam sword market least handl seem made slightli better firmer materi perhap best aspect sword clash togeth battl though sword hurt le expens foam mele weapon anoth plu asid afford handl anticip blue sword surviv sinc counterpart alreadi bust within cannot recommend purchas return updat possibl add star find blue sword markedli outliv expect

However baby cannot swipe with his or her finger to get to the second screen. There are only two screams, and the way baby has to get to each one is there is a I guess you would call it a plastic toggle that the baby has to push back and forth to get to and from the two screens. I realized it was not very expensive but it is very hard for my baby to toggle that switch to get to the other screen and it says it's for 6 to 36 months. My daughter is 11 months and has a hard time moving that toggle back and forth. Also, the touch screen itself is pretty wonky like when you push let's say the home button sometimes it will trigger another button instead of the home button. I bought this for my daughter because she is constantly wanting to play with my phone and she knows how to unlock it by swiping it and I'm worried she's going to delete pictures of her or delete something important hence why I bought this for her. So I thought as soon as I gave it to her she would love it but she didn't like it at all I think primarily the reason she did not like it was because it's too hard for her to manipulated. as I said before it's very hard to toggle between the two screens and the touchscreen itself you have to push pretty hard to get it too work. I'm hoping as my daughter gets older that she will like this more because I've noticed when I bought her toys before she was not interested in them but as she got older she started to develop in interest for them. I will update this review if my daughter does like it and can manipulate it when she's a little bit older but she's almost a year now and I would think she would be able to manipulate it but it's even kind of hard for me I am going to add a video showing you how hard it is for me to toggle and work the toy. I think this story is probably better suited for older children definitely not 6 months old or in my case almost a year old LOL.",1517875200,3,div idvideoblockr1rkv9orvb7ow7 classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesid1spmx2bbzsmp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi81riegsxo3spng classvideoslateimgurlnbspi gave three star first actual thought swipe phone babi could swipe differ screen say touch phone toy howev babi cannot swipe finger get second screen two scream way babi get one guess would call plastic toggl babi push back forth get two screen realiz expens hard babi toggl switch get screen say 6 36 month daughter 11 month hard time move toggl back forth also touch screen pretti wonki like push let say home button sometim trigger anoth button instead home button bought daughter constantli want play phone know unlock swipe im worri she go delet pictur delet someth import henc bought thought soon gave would love didnt like think primarili reason like hard manipul said hard toggl two screen touchscreen push pretti hard get

My 11 month old daughter loves to play with my phone, so I thought I would get her this because it looks just like a phone and it says it's a touch screen and it can be swiped to different screens. However, the plastic toggle that new baby has to slide across to get from one screen to the next by the way there's only two screens. For some reason I thought there were more screens and more features. Anyways, the toggle that baby has to slide from side to side is very hard to maneuver even for me! my baby was getting very frustrated as she could not get it to move. and then there is a touch screen itself you can touch the screen but you have to push it really hard I thought it would be more sensitive but it is not! Also the phone is pretty big and hard for my baby to hold with her small hands it says it's for 6 to 36 months, but I don't think a six-month-old baby could manipulate this toy! I'm sure when she gets older she will like it more but I was hoping this would be a winner because she's always wanting to play with my phone and knows how to swipe it and unlock it and sometimes changes settings and delete things LOL so I thought I would get her this so she would have her very own phone. I should have done my research a lot of people said it was a good toy but I found one that is an actual touch swipe phone and has so many more features! It is more pricey sure, but it has tons of features compare to this one! I was reading the Box on the picture of this VTech phone and it made it seem like it had more features than actually does! It allows you to save your home phone number for what reason I do not know! I guess maybe just to teach your baby your phone number for emergencies but I mean that's kind of a long way until that is going to be memorized! speaking of saving the home phone number I set it up to save my number and when you push the button that has a house on it it's supposed to say call home and then say the number but now when I push it it just makes a funny noise or play the song and doesn't say the number anymore and I haven't did anything to delete the number. will most likely be sending this back and purchasing the other phone. not too sure yet, I will give it another couple weeks to see if she gets interested in it because as I've learned with my child being that she is my first, she will not be interested in new toys until she gets a little bit older and then she loves them so this might be one of those toys so I will hold off on sending it back. It's not a bad price and I usually love all VTech toys. I really had high hopes for this one being that my baby as I stated before loves to play with my phone so I thought this was perfect! Great idea like I said I would recommend it for older babies toddlers my baby is almost a year old and her hands are so small that he can't really manipulate the toggle button at all and it just frustrates her more than anything and doesn't keep her attention even when I do it for her she does not seem interested. sorry for the grammar and the run-on sentences I apologize for that! I will try to upload a video on my review to show you how hard it is to talk go back and forth and some of the functions of it. Not sure if it will actually go through because I tried putting a video on a review before and it did not show up even though I uploaded it and everything but that's another situation LOL. If my baby comes to Lovelace toy and figures it out, I will update this review as I think it's only fair to do so! This is just my opinion and my experience! I know every baby is different so ultimately it is up to you obviously I just wanted to give my review so that you have a little bit of a heads up that I wish I had!",1517875200,2,div idvideoblockr12tq8nqggsr0i classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesie1d2ymwy4smp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi81dtgw1w3yspng classvideoslateimgurlnbspth idea good execut poor 11 month old daughter love play phone thought would get look like phone say touch screen swipe differ screen howev plastic toggl new babi slide across get one screen next way there two screen reason thought screen featur anyway toggl babi slide side side hard maneuv even babi get frustrat could get move touch screen touch screen push realli hard thought would sensit also phone pretti big hard babi hold small hand say 6 36 month dont think sixmonthold babi could manipul toy im sure get older like hope would winner she alway want play phone know swipe unlock sometim chang set delet thing lol thought would get would phone done research lot peopl said good toy found one actual touch swipe phone mani featur

5092,1190,2542,"I own several drones (Phantoms) and wanted a smaller drone to fly in the yard for practice and fun. I didn't need a camera (since the Phantoms are my camera drones) and not having a camera extends the flight time and makes the drone more nimble (less weight). When I first got it I was surprised on how small it was. But after flying it for a few weeks it has proved to be a good flyer and very durable. It is very quiet and won't annoy your neighbors. It comes with prop guards and I have crashed it several times with no damage to the props (or drone). I am getting about 5 or 6 minutes of flying time per battery and they take about 30 minutes to recharge. It uses the older 2.4 GHz frequency which is not as good as the 5.8 GHz frequency (less interference) but so far I have had no problems with interference. It has what Holy Stone calls the ""Headless Security System"" which when activated helps beginners fly the drone in a straight line (sometimes when the drone is not pointing away from you it can be disorientating and hard to control) in the headless mode the drone will fly back when the stick is pulled back regardless of which way it is pointing. It has a 6 axis gyro system which helps keep the drone stable in-flight. One cool feature is the auto flip function, by pushing a button (right stick) you can activate the flip mode, push the stick in and then move it in the direction you want to flip and the drone will do all the work and flip in that direction. Just be sure you are high enough as it does lose a little altitude when it performs the flip.

5293,1190,2608,"I just purchased a Phantom 3 standard which came with one original DJI battery. I needed a second battery to extend my flying time. The DJI battery is pretty expensive and I looked at non-DJI alternatives. I heard the horror stories about these non-DJI batteries not working properly, but at half the price and having somewhat favorable reviews I decided to try the Powerextra battery. I have been running smaller Powerextra batteries in my mini drone with no issues. I received the battery and it came in a lipo pouch (supposed to help contain a fire in the event the battery catches fire). When received it was showing 2 green bars, so I attached it to the DJI power supply and let it charge for about 45 minutes until all the lights were green. I took it for a test flight in my drone, the drone powered up and I was able to fly for about 15 or so minutes with no issues. When done the battery still had 2 green bars. I also bought a Powerextra battery for my Phantom 2 and have used it twice so far with no issues. It appears that the Powerextra brand makes replacement batteries for the Phantom series that work ok. Time will tell regarding how many cycles I get and how balanced battery remains. I have been into RC for a long time and I am very familiar with Lipo batteries/charging. The DJI batteries are expensive because the charging controller circuitry (brains) is actually part of the battery. Most other batteries don't contain the controller circuitry and that is usually handled by the charger. DJI chose to place the controlling circuitry in the battery and the charging adapter just supplies power. The controlling circuitry handles the main charge, balancing, overcharge/overheating protection and cutoff levels. Batteries will be more expensive when the control circuitry is part of the battery, but it allows for a far more intelligent battery, which DJI uses to provide control/telemetry to the drone and remote/Go app.",1518134400,5,purchas phantom 3 standard came one origin dji batteri need second batteri extend fli time dji batteri pretti expens look nondji altern heard horror stori nondji batteri work properli half price somewhat favor review decid tri powerextra batteri run smaller powerextra batteri mini drone issu receiv batteri came lipo pouch suppos help contain fire event batteri catch fire receiv show 2 green bar attach dji power suppli let charg 45 minut light green took test flight drone drone power abl fli 15 minut issu done batteri still 2 green bar also bought powerextra batteri phantom 2 use twice far issu appear powerextra brand make replac batteri phantom seri work ok time tell regard mani cycl get balanc batteri remain rc long time familiar lipo batteriescharg dji batteri expens charg control circuitri brain actual part batteri batteri dont contain control circuitri usual handl charger dji chose place control circuitri batteri charg adapt suppli power control circuitri handl main charg balanc overchargeoverh protect

About the defect: Fresh batteries in the controller. Fully charged quadcopter LiPo battery. Powered on controller and powered on quadcopter. Both start out flashing fast. Controller flashes slowly after about 10 seconds and LCD display shows signal strength symbol. Battery indicator also shows full. Pushed left stick all the way up (1 beep) then down (another beep) - and the controller LED is solid blue. Problem is that the quadcopter is still flashing fast. Quadcopter does not respond to throttle but controller LCD display does show throttle up. Tried this over a dozen times.

As for setup (attaching prop guards, landing gear and camera), it was fairly easy but the screws would wear out quickly if you dismantle it every time after use - which I like to do.

(Why did they stop making them like that??  Frustrating.) Also the Mini Mouse moves up and down with the spinning propeller; a cool feature that has gone away as well.
Anyway, I got the Mickey plane bc I wanted her to have the full experience of all the bells and whistles. Sadly, Micky just slightly leans from side to side (barely noticeable) with the tilt/turn of the steering column, in fact she hasn't noticed it. Boo. And as I stated, theres no under-seat storage... and obviously no shape sorter bonus feature. Bummer. BUT thats me being critical bc its still very cute with fun features.

My girls and I enjoy making crafts together, and I prefer to use sets with needed supplies and instructions.

The instructions are on the back, so don't throw out the box until completed, and it's fairly simple to put together. The blank cards provided are so children can create their own pictures, which can then be stored inside the camera, which means that these are even smaller bits of thick paper that doesn't allow much room for coloring.

Assembly took about 2 hours, but wasn't too complicated or difficult.

 PROS:
- two speed levels; the slower speed is great for smaller kids but I like that you can make it faster for when they're older
- LOVE that it can seat two for fun with siblings
- high weight limit and seats to accommodate taller kids means your kids will enjoy this car for years to come (a lot of the power wheels have seats/cabins the kids will outgrow much faster)
- battery is easy and quick to charge
- the open cabin design makes for easy upgrading if you wanted to tinker with it to customize
- tires have great traction, and it was able to go uphill, downhill, and over some fairly rough terrain with no problems - can definitely handle regular grass/gravel and isn't going to be tied down to pavement like some of them.
CONS:
- Seats are too long for a shorter child and aren't adjustable. We fixed it by propping a furniture cushion behind him.
- We wish there was a switch to turn the car completely off (or even better a key), as it is a bit of a safety issue for the kiddo to take off on their own
- Although the bumper will stop the car if it collides into anything, the low profile of the car makes it possible to drive UNDER a raised up obstacle (like a parked car or truck) and it could seriously injure the children. If it had a windshield like some of the models, that would stop the car in time. Not necessarily something I would change, just something to keep in mind when supervising.",1518307200,5,div idvideoblockr12jj28p228p92 classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesic1fuvn3cmdsmp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesic10i2byebksspng classvideoslateimgurlnbspw realli love car enjoy use assembl took 2 hour wasnt complic difficult pro two speed level slower speed great smaller kid like make faster theyr older love seat two fun sibl high weight limit seat accommod taller kid mean kid enjoy car year come lot power wheel seatscabin kid outgrow much faster batteri easi quick charg open cabin design make easi upgrad want tinker custom tire great traction abl go uphil downhil fairli rough terrain problem definit handl regular grassgravel isnt go tie pavement like con seat long shorter child arent adjust fix prop furnitur cushion behind wish switch turn car complet even better key bit safeti issu kiddo take although bumper stop car collid anyth low profil car make possibl drive rais obstacl like park car truck could serious injur child windshield like model would stop car time necessarili someth would chang someth keep mind supervis

Maui, came perfectly packaged.  he was soft to the touch, and would be very happy that his hair remained soft and silky in transport. lol Loved the details from the tattoos, to his hook.  Loved that the necklace is sewn on...cannot be removed! I felt he can definitely be heard just fine.  Not too loud where the child loses their hearing if they fall asleep on him, but loud enough they can hear him over the giggles my child will make.
His words were not cut off in anyway....however, I felt he had so many amazing lines in the movie (ex: his infamous line ""You're welcome"" etc) and it was not used.  Seriously!!! That was really disappointing...6 or so lines and all are meh lines.  But still love him! He is soft and cuddly, and perfect!

The quality is the top quality you would expect from LEGO... so no worries there.

Having said that, this color baseplate is on the way out the door as its been replaced by the blue baseplate. If history is any indication of the future, the blue baseplate will stay in production for 3-4 years before the sand (tan) baseplate will return.

Long story short of all that... snag some of these sand colored baseplates soon if you want to be able to get them at a reasonable price.

Great quality and they look great... two thumbs up.

My son has a speech delay so he can't say any of the letters yet, but he is able to identify every letter and properly place them back into the case.

Each letter fits very snugly into its spot, and therefore requires a little push to secure it back in place. This has helped with our speech therapy, allowing my son to follow instructions such as pull (there is an indentation on each letter to help you pop it out), push, and ""find x"". The case is difficult to open for my son, but by no means would an adult struggle.

I have become pretty familiar, after hours of play (or watching:) There are a lot of cars and trucks with lots of features, like doors that open and parts that are intended to be removed and replaced. This Pickle is sturdy, hefty and fun to look at. I like the design and free movement of the wheels.

The car is nicely detailed and well made. There were other versions, lower priced, but I chose this one because it said ""die-cast""; and I am not sorry I did.

6193,1765,929,"This is a fantastic games for older toddlers and two-year-olds! The cards are big enough for a child to grab onto, and the photos are bright and engaging.

HOW IT WORKS: There are 6 different colors (you play one color at a time) and 6 cards in each color, meaning the game can go on for quite awhile. Each of the colors has a category (like clothing or shapes). The main way to play is laying out the 6 big circle cards and then flipping a small square card over one at a time to find the match.

WHAT THEYRE LEARNING: All the pictured items and animals are good vocabulary words for these little ones to learn. My 28-month-old has been playing this for over a month and has learned the concept of finding a match from it. My son caught on right away to the idea of playing memory with this.

EXTENSIONS: The instructions include some ways of enriching this game for older kids (allowing the child to turn over a square card and asking the parent to find the match) or making it simpler for younger ones (naming the photos, making the noises together of the animals pictured). There is also a gross motor component, encouraging kids to move from one card to another as they search, but my son likes them all spread around him in a circle so he doesn't have to move.

As a former preschool teacher, I would say some 3-year-olds might find this game fun for awhile, but really the right age would be 18 months up to about 36 months. You can also play the game with more than one child at a time.",1518566400,5,fantast game older toddler twoyearold card big enough child grab onto photo bright engag work 6 differ color play one color time 6 card color mean game go quit awhil color categori like cloth shape main way play lay 6 big circl card flip small squar card one time find match theyr learn pictur item anim good vocabulari word littl one learn 28monthold play month learn concept find match son caught right away idea play memori extens instruct includ way enrich game older kid allow child turn squar card ask parent find match make simpler younger one name photo make nois togeth anim pictur also gross motor compon encourag kid move one card anoth search son like spread around circl doesnt move former preschool teacher would say 3yearold might find game fun awhil realli right age would 18 month 36 month also play game one child time

6197,1264,824,"+Non-compensated review.+

This Moms reasons for loving this particular toy:

The highest concentration of nerve endings that attach to pacinian corpuscles - feeling vibration - and Meissner corpuscles - feeling light touch - are located where? Lips and fingertips! No wonder they touch and chew on everything! :-)
 Since your baby has already begun to develop their sense of touch as early as 16 WEEKS gestation, and this region of the brain is the most significant in terms of all senses early in life (and in later life - think about it, you see blind and deaf elders, but very few who can no longer feel) it makes sense to offer toys with varying textures and complex structure. While these little toys may not be very durable, they sure serve their purpose with infants!

* Arrived in a bag, thankfully with no awful plastic stench!
* Very nice coloration. Not too blah, not too fluorescent.
* Size is perfect for gripping, and structural integrity is such that a smaller hand can collapse the ball (like the bigger purple one) enough to grab hold of it.
* Since they are lead-free and BPA-free, they are safe for little gummers.
* Light weight and easy to toss around to discover cause and effect. Try putting a ball in babys hand while you hold them and let it drop into/on to something that makes noise...the game never ends!
* Great for working on object permanence as well as color naming and recognition. We loved playing Wheres the (color name) ball? by hiding the balls under a box or blanket and squealing when little mister found the right one. 

Research proves that the more varied your childs tactile experiences are, the more open they are to instruction (higher academic performance), their instances of anxiety dramatically reduce (fewer tantrums!), and their ability to maintain and build on the vast network of synapses they were given at birth is improved. So, in short, help your babys somatosensory system be all it can be by offering not just your affectionate touch, but a serious of fascinating new objects on a regular basis - like these fun, simple toys!

I hope you found this helpful and not too boring, lol! Unfortunately, by the time I got around to a review several months had passed and our puppy had eaten most of them.

6291,596,335,"My son (three years old) has been playing with LEGO for almost as long as he's been alive... he didn't really have a choice since his daddy is a big fan of LEGO.

Having said that, I was hesitant to purchase any DUPLO sets because I knew it would only be a matter of time before my son would grow out of them and then they would no longer be used. Reluctantly, my wife and I decided to purchase this set after seeing my son playing with a box of DUPLO bricks at his school.

Long story short... the DUPLO bricks have been very good for my son as he's been able to build more easily, and he gets less frustrated when using these bricks (when compared to the smaller LEGO bricks).

If you have a younger child and you're looking to develop a love for building and creativity, I don't think you can go wrong with this set.

Overall, I give this set a strong recommendation as there's a wide range of DUPLO blocks that provide countless hours of enjoyment for your young bricker.

If my review was helpful, please let me know below. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

6307,385,917,"We have lots of grandkids that we babysit with regularityrather than invest in a smaller, hard plastic tub, I thought using this inflatable swan tub was a much more versatile idea.  Its quick and easy to inflate/deflate, and can be used directly in the bath tub or anywhere else thats convenient.  Our bathtub is a standard size; the swan fits snugly inside it, but for added safety, theres a large suction cup located on the bottom's outside near the tail.  Theres just enough water space inside the inflatable to make infants comfortably cozy, and I don't have to worry about them slipping or getting too close to our tubs very hard and unforgiving water faucet.  Filling with water is easy, and the heat indicator built into the bottom is a nice added touch.  Water temps over 104 change the purple heart logo into a big red word that reads HOT.  The babies like to lean back against the swans tail, which makes a comfortable headrest.

Weve used this swan repeatedly, and have had no issues with leaking.  It takes about five minutes to completely and adequately fill using an electric air pump (Munchkin stresses not to over-inflate), and a big drain plug quickly releases water from inside the swan when bath time is done.  We also find it handy to use outdoors on hot days, and weve even used it as a float in our inground pool.  Kids outgrow baby equipment so rapidly; its nice to find one that can be used for other purposes as well.",1518652800,5,lot grandkid babysit regularityrath invest smaller hard plastic tub thought use inflat swan tub much versatil idea quick easi inflatedefl use directli bath tub anywher el that conveni bathtub standard size swan fit snugli insid ad safeti there larg suction cup locat bottom outsid near tail there enough water space insid inflat make infant comfort cozi dont worri slip get close tub hard unforgiv water faucet fill water easi heat indic built bottom nice ad touch water temp 104 chang purpl heart logo big red word read hot babi like lean back swan tail make comfort headrest weve use swan repeatedli issu leak take five minut complet adequ fill use electr air pump munchkin stress overinfl big drain plug quickli releas water insid swan bath time done also find handi use outdoor hot day weve even use float inground pool kid outgrow babi equip rapidli nice find one use purpos well

6371,2131,2893,"The Green Toys Fire Engine is great fun for my 21-month-old. The vehicle isn't too big nor too small for her hands.  The cute cat fireman character is a safe size for play for little ones that may still be inclined to putting things in their mouth. The sizing and lightweight material is perfect for picking up and moving the vehicle and driver about.

The cat fireman that is included in the set can sit in the front or back seat of the firetruck. The inside of the cat is hollow and you can also use your finger in this place to use the character like you would for a finger puppet. The cat is solid in color. The detail on the cat features a fire coat, hat, and fire extinguisher. The character is very solid and the plastic won't bend with much pressure.

There are two spots on the firetruck for sitting, if your child has another Green Toys character figure, it can ride along with during play. The characters don't lock into place or tightly rest in the seats if the firetruck was going very fast along the floor or ground or going over a bumpy terrain, it likely will fall out. This is not a huge issue but it's worth mentioning!

There are little details on the firetruck I am glad that were included. There is the dashboard with a steering wheel and a few other controls. The outside of the firetruck details includes a ladder, hose, and so forth. The wheels move about on the floor without getting caught or turning poorly.

It can be cleaned easily with soap and water. There are no sharp parts and doesn't appear that it will break easily. I like since it's so easy to clean that it can be brought outside or played with indoors.

This toy is made in the USA, and is safe from BPA, phthalates, and PVC. I like being able to share with my children that their toy was created because someone else took the time to recycle items like milk jugs. These are 100% made out of recyclable material and I think that's just awesome.

I am happy with the quality and more than satisfied with the great pricing for such an awesome and sustainable choice for a toy that appeals to both boys and girls.

That being said, when The Wardens Christmas list to Santa starts to take shape, I often solicit enlightenment presenting multiple pictures for her to make final selections. She chose this unknown puzzle. Not very romantic, I know, but after more than 30 years of screwing up, well 

So, now its February in New England, an excellent opportunity to catchup on some good books under a warm blanket with a cold Smirnoff. Recently released, Ive been enjoying The Midnight Front by author David Mack. Described too quickly, its like a mature tale of Harry Potter vs. the 3rd Reich during World War Two. It begins with a sage old karcist (i.e. sorcerer) named Adair training young magicians to confront those of Germany.

Personally, when an author weaves real names and/or places into their fiction, I find some web research adds spice to the overall enjoyment. And where does this weathered magician (last name Macrae) initially house & tutor his apprentice adepts?

Yup, the castle of Eileen Donan. Pretty cool, huh?

PS  Very nice puzzle that the bRiDe enjoyed assembling. Wikipedia has a truly stunning sunset image of this grand old Scottish abode.
-------------------

Wikipedia: Eilean Donan (Scottish Gaelic: Eilean Donnain) is a small tidal island where three sea lochs meet, Loch Duich, Loch Long and Loch Alsh, in the western Highlands of Scotland. A picturesque castle that frequently appears in photographs, film and television dominates the island, which lies about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from the village of Dornie. Since the castle's restoration in the early 20th century, a footbridge has connected the island to the mainland.

Eilean Donan, which means simply ""island of Donnn"", is named after Donnn of Eigg, a Celtic saint martyred in 617. Donnn is said to have established a church on the island, though no trace of this remains.

The castle was founded in the thirteenth century, and became a stronghold of the Clan Mackenzie and their allies the Clan Macrae. In the early eighteenth century, the Mackenzies' involvement in the Jacobite rebellions led in 1719 to the castle's destruction by government ships. Lieutenant-Colonel John Macrae-Gilstrap's twentieth-century reconstruction of the ruins produced the present buildings.",1518739200,4,life alway good alway bad often iron ive marri long time said warden christma list santa start take shape often solicit enlighten present multipl pictur make final select chose unknown puzzl romant know 30 year screw well februari new england excel opportun catchup good book warm blanket cold smirnoff recent releas ive enjoy midnight front author david mack describ quickli like matur tale harri potter v 3rd reich world war two begin sage old karcist ie sorcer name adair train young magician confront germani person author weav real name andor place fiction find web research add spice overal enjoy weather magician last name macra initi hous tutor apprentic adept yup castl eileen donan pretti cool huh p nice puzzl bride enjoy assembl wikipedia truli stun sunset imag grand old scottish abod wikipedia eilean donan scottish gaelic eilean donnain small tidal island three sea loch meet loch duich loch long loch alsh western highland scotland picturesqu castl frequent appear photograph film televis domin island lie 1 kilometr 062 mi villag dorni sinc castl restor earli 20th centuri footbridg connect island mainland eilean donan mean simpli island donnn name donnn eigg

I got this for my son who is a year old in a few days. We've had it since Christmas when he was about 10 months old. Even though the reviews were very good, I wasn't sure what could be so great about this stationary little car. I have to say that I am very impressed overall. It is easy to put together. It comes with accessories like balls and shapes that you can put through the appropriate holes in the car's sides. My son LOVES balls. So while they frequently end up all over the house, balls are his kingdom and he loves them.

The car is really good for babies who are learning to pull themselves up. My son does crawl and scoot around it playing with all of the functions. He especially loves the ""radio."" I'm pretty sure this car taught him his sense of rhythm because he started dancing to the ""hip hop"" song and now his favorite thing to do is push the radio buttons and dance. He even stood up by himself dancing for the first time the other day. He's always playing with this car in one way or another. He likes to put his toys in the space where he's supposed to sit - but hey, it kind of helps me look like I've cleaned the living room. I throw things in closets and under the bed so if he wants to shove all his toys in the car so they're not scattered all over my living room floor - good on him! ;)

It also looks like this is going to grow with him, which is always a plus - especially when products are on the more pricey side. I love toys that evolve with baby. I would definitely say that this is a good investment and that the right time to get it is when your babes start to crawl because it can really help them advance with their motor skills.

I don't see how this was play-tested with kids and that didn't come out as an issue. It is interesting that the rattle they make has wood bunny ears so the company has a better solution in another toy! Yes, you can cut the ears off, but is that really what you want to do to the new toy you just bought?

After that, it's really a nice stacking toy. I don't mind the hard stick, because every stacking toy needs a stick. I don't think a kid this age is going to poke their eye on the stick. The stick end is better rounded than the Melissa and Doug one.

I love that the stacker doesn't have a real correct order. It looks nice in the ""right"" way, but it can be stacked in a lot of ways. The only thing that has to be in any order is that the head has to go on top because the head's hole doesn't go all the way through.

Really, if they would have had safer ears, I would have given this five stars. If it's a possible safety issue, I can't recommend it. I cut the remaining ear off mine and it looks kinda ugly.

6638,2218,71,"Great game concept, so-so components.

Pros:

Real science. The concept behind the game is that each player represents a corporation vying to colonize and control a new colony on Mars. Melt glaciers to make lakes, dump algae in the lakes to promote biodiversity, crash an asteroid in the planet to help warm the surface. Every single card in the game is based on real or near-future science.

CUBES! So many cubes. Each player gets little cubes to place on their playmat to track their production of steel, power, metal, and other resources. You also collect metallic cubes to represent money. Don't forgot the cubes to track the overall progress of Mars- you track how many generations (turns) you've been playing, temperature, humidity, and oxygen content in the atmosphere. SO MANY CUBES!

There's a great sense of progression in the game. Everyone is always doing something, together or alone. You're mining steel, you're generating electricity, your electricity development creates heat, your heat melts ice, as ice melts you can do more biological projects. There are so many feedback systems, so many ways to progress. It can get easy to forget about the main board where you're supposed to track the progress of the planet, because you're so busy with your own playmat.

Mars. I mean it's a game about Mars, with a large 4-piece board to represent the red planet, and a lot of real science about how humans would colonize Mars. The theme is ever-present, and some people are really going to dig that.

Cons:

Player mats are a real problem. The game would benefit hugely if you could use a free map to toss out all the cubes and track things electronically. The problem is that the playmats are cheap paper. This means it's easy for cubes to shift position due to a bowed sheet, or if you bump a sheet you lose a lot of information with no real way to put it back together. And that's the real core of the game- you do a lot of work on those cheap sheets with some little plastic cubes, making it hard to justify the cost of the package. Another idea would be if they could do a dual-layer cardboard player mat, so there would be individual wells for the dice to sit in and they can't be jostled out of place so easily.

Overall:

I feel like this game needs a Second Edition. Give me a cheaper map of Mars because you don't really interact with that, but better playmats since that's where you spend all your time. The end goals of the game are also a little weak. At the last minute you have to wager on whether you think you can win certain awards- such as generating the most of certain resources. By the end of the game you probably already know who's winning what, and wagering earlier in the game would mean you'll fall too far behind to keep up with other players. So the end of the game could use a little strengthening.

The concept is there. Lots of players have a lot of fun participating in all these systems and pushing cubes around their mat. I also didn't have any problem with the art- a lot of cards have really bad stock photography, where most games coming out today have expensive custom art on every card. The rest of the cards have custom drawing and art which is only so-so. If there were a Second Edition, the game does need a more consistent art style, but that's a minor concern. If you like Mars, if you like science, if you like cubes- give it a try.",1518912000,4,great game concept soso compon pro real scienc concept behind game player repres corpor vy colon control new coloni mar melt glacier make lake dump alga lake promot biodivers crash asteroid planet help warm surfac everi singl card game base real nearfutur scienc cube mani cube player get littl cube place playmat track product steel power metal resourc also collect metal cube repres money dont forgot cube track overal progress mar track mani gener turn youv play temperatur humid oxygen content atmospher mani cube there great sen progress game everyon alway someth togeth alon your mine steel your gener electr electr develop creat heat heat melt ice ice melt biolog project mani feedback system mani way progress get easi forget main board your suppos track progress planet your busi playmat mar mean game mar larg 4piec board repres red planet lot real scienc human would colon mar theme everpres peopl realli go dig con player mat real problem game would benefit huge could use free map toss cube track thing electron problem playmat cheap paper mean easi cube shift

6708,1264,210,"Theres not a lot that can be said about Play-Doh that everyone doesnt already know. That being said, lets focus on price, duration, size, and color!

- I did receive every shade of primary color as well as everything in between. I wish Id gotten doubles of the red or black, but got double of lavender, a daffodil-colored yellow, and hot pink. There were shades of Play-Doh I didn't even know existed! I chose the frustration-free packaging (I LOVE that this is an option now) but ended up keeping the box for storage.
- These are not full-sized cans, but for the volume its still worth it!
- Unlike some of what I read before I bought these, the cans we got did not last very long. Play time was very well controlled and everything got put back and sealed, but I had to refresh nearly all of them several times over (with a plastic baggie, water, and a lot of mashing. We bought this as a Christmas gift and as of mid-February weve now thrown them all away. Whats funny is the pack I got in June of last year was played with in a similar fashion but lasted until December with very, very few refreshes needed. Did something change or did I get an old package?
- For the price I paid, I would not order these again. It sounds like most people got their packs for $16-20 if Im reading things right. I paid $26 before tax for this box and will not do it again. Not enough value for price. Ill be looking for another vendor next time around, or waiting for a price drop!

**Refreshment Tip: If its beginning to dry out, you can get away with putting a few drops of water on top and then sealing up. Some will seep in but youll still have to get your hands dirty by squishing and smashing to distribute. If its REALLY dry, like you're thinking its better as a paper weight than Play-Doh, break it up as best you can, put in a plastic baggie or sealed container, and run a tablespoon or more of hot water. Let it sit for a while (or if you want to be frustrated start mashing right away) and then use a fork or fingers to get it moving again. I often end up with a lot of extra water thats easily wicked away with a paper towel but it does get it back to near-new. Its just a lot of work!

As you can see in the pics, the kiddos had a good time making food on Christmas Day! Just wish it had lasted a bit longer.

Everyday, all day.
* She loads up her toys in it and pushes it around.  She hasn't pulled it 'Yet'.
* The wheels roll smoothly, because it is  4.5 pounds, lightweight. With the weight distributed over the four wheels it's like pushing a feather.
* We have used it both indoor and out door. It Does Not Roll As easy Over gravel.
* The product description says it is NOT for children to ride in.
*  I think that is an important thing to remember, however, I sit her inside on her Minnie Mouse blanket and she does not move a muscle.
*  I have pulled her around for an hour (a few times). She sits still, happy as a clam sitting ramrod straight.
* I included a pic and painted out some identifying features. But, you can see she is happy riding in her wagon.
*  I get to keep my granddaughter weekdays while my daughter, her mommy, teaches school. I love it.
* We do many fun things together. This wagon has brought us both lots of good times.
* I got this wagon because it is nearing the end of February and in a month I will be outside beginning my summer gardening project.
* I Have my own wagon that I pull around with my garden tools.
* Since she copies what I do inside I knew she would try to copy what I do outside.
* Now she has her own wagon and her own set of plastic gardening tools.
* I know she loves the wagon. Heck, I love the wagon.
* I love seeing her giggles and her cognitive development as she figures out her wagon movement..
* This wagon is completely child safe (No Sharp Edges) and it is recyclable.
* There is a stamp on the handle and on the bottom of the wagon to recycle. See photos.

6817,596,158,"My son loves his Nerf 'shooter'... we try not to use the word gun. Perhaps we should use blaster... I like that.

Anyway... my son is three years old, so perhaps he's a little young for this blaster, but he struggles to pull back the lever to blast a Nerf bullet. This blaster can hold 6 Nerf bullets, which is nice, but it can be a pain to try and keep track of all the Nerf bullets once they start flying. Perhaps that is part of the Nerf business model since the Nerf bullets are constantly getting lost.

My son also struggles to load the Nerf bullets into the blaster... once again, perhaps he is too young. I've also noticed that the blaster will occasionally jam and won't shoot out the Nerf bullets. This has caused several of the Nerf bullets to bend and as a result, they no longer work in the Nerf blaster since they are bent and won't properly load/shoot out.

I will give this Nerf blaster credit for being sturdy and solid... I've watched my son drop, kick, throw, and smash his Nerf blaster and it appears to operate and function the same way it did on day one.

In closing, this Nerf blaster is 'ok,' but I'm not entirely in love with it. As I've mentioned before, maybe my son is too young and perhaps the experience would be better if he were a little older.

If my review helped to inform you, please let me know below. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Our grandson loves to draw on ANYTHING, so I figured this would be a hit, until.... we immediately discovered that whatever you draw begins to fade almost immediately as the water dries.  It works by filling the ""pens"" with water. There are four pens that snap onto the case. You draw on the surface of the pad with the pens to make your picture, but like I said, once the water begins to dry, your picture goes away.  There are two sides to draw on, but even before turning it over to draw on the other side, the first picture started to fade.

This isn't the kind of drawing toy where your kid can keep a drawing to show you later. It's now or never.  I'm not really sure what the designers had in mind, other than it's a way to draw without having ink or paint that spills and makes a mess, and little kids can play with it unsupervised. I suppose this would be perfect for kids with really SHORT attention spans, but for kids interested in creating a picture, it's not one that leaves a lasting impression.",1518998400,3,ok mayb expect great grandson love draw anyth figur would hit immedi discov whatev draw begin fade almost immedi water dri work fill pen water four pen snap onto case draw surfac pad pen make pictur like said water begin dri pictur goe away two side draw even turn draw side first pictur start fade isnt kind draw toy kid keep draw show later never im realli sure design mind way draw without ink paint spill make mess littl kid play unsupervis suppos would perfect kid realli short attent span kid interest creat pictur one leav last impress

6997,826,2172,"I'm not even sure how to rate this. Let's start with: The bed I received looks nothing like the one I actually ordered. Sure it's pink, and yes it's a triple bunk bed, but the similarities end there. The bed has solid foot and head boards, not rails. There are no round bed posts and although the beds stack, there is no way they fit INTO each other. This means if bumped into, they will fall off of one another. The good info: it's cute and although fragile, sturdy enough for gentle play. Back to the bad news: There is no trundle under the bottom bunk. The lack of a trundle is the most upsetting part. The instructions claim there are two ladders (one for triple stack, one for regular bunk beds), and I only received one. The bed came with really cute accessories, but I wish the bed I ordered had been what the company sent. I don't feel like going through a lengthy return/exchange process and the bed is already assembled, but perhaps I can at least get my ladder for the two bed stack and the trundle to fit underneath the bed??? The trundle for the bed I actually ordered should fit this bed since both are meant for 18"" American Girl Dolls, right?...

The nano directions are lacking as they are not as detailed and spread out as lego brand directions and they do not show what type and how many pieces you need of each block.  I found it best to look and set aside the blocks I need for each step then there is less chance of error.  One of the hippo's legs does not stay secure.  I tired different leg posts so I am guessing it the underside base block which I tried to bend out the middle bar under the block which did not help much.  I also use a mini screwdriver to pry pieces apart and stick them together when needed.  I could see how a male with bigger hands and thicker fingers would have issues putting it together due to the blocks small size. Very life like with the opening of the jaw/teeth/nostrils.

After doing a Loz brand block, which are similar to Nano brand, I found the Nano brand inferior. The nano blocks do not stay together as securely so pieces that are held on with one connection i,e, the tail and antennae of this item easily come off with just a touch or slight nudge.

In this game, you are using meeples to move across a grid of tiles mancala-style, trying to capture a number of meeples of the same color. The different colors represent the different abilities of the meeples (red are assassins and can remove a meeple off the board or from a player's hand, white are elders and can score points or help pay for Djinn cards, etc). If you are able to remove the last meeple from a tile, you get to claim it and it scores you points at the end of the game.

7198,2404,2110,"Received this off my registry. After much research, I chose this because of its simplicity and versatility to grow with child. You can adjust the placement of toys around the table, which is how I realized my daughter is OCD much like her father ;). She had a short tantrum when her toys weren't in the usual order after mommy rearranged them. She has gone through each toy being her favorite, except for the trees, give her a month or so. The music bar has 3 settings which I like. I started off with hitting any button to play music and now weve graduated to hitting a specific key to play certain songs. Theres also a piano setting where you can play each key to tone. We are still at the first stage of table, with the music bar on top. Will move bar down once her feet can fully reach. So far, love it. The table has become a part of our daily morning routine. And it doesnt hurt, that its a great place to set baby when you need both hands.",1519171200,5,receiv registri much research chose simplic versatil grow child adjust placement toy around tabl realiz daughter ocd much like father short tantrum toy werent usual order mommi rearrang gone toy favorit except tree give month music bar 3 set like start hit button play music weve graduat hit specif key play certain song there also piano set play key tone still first stage tabl music bar top move bar foot fulli reach far love tabl becom part daili morn routin doesnt hurt great place set babi need hand

Fun game and if you grasp Carcassone, you'll pick this up quickly.  The goals change each game, so has a lot of replayability.

I live in a climate where mold tends to develop easily, so I shy away from bath toys that have openings or crevices where mold can develop--and where I can't in turn clean and remove the mold. At the same time, I want stuff that my kids are going to enjoy and play with, so you can see how this can sometimes turn into an Easter egg hunt!

These bobbers are awesome! There are no holes or small crevices, so I don't have to worry about mold--thus extending their lifetime. And, they are super cute, and my kids find them interesting! How do they float, they ask. They rock them back and forth, giggling. Bottom line, they like them and I like them, so these are 5-star in my book!

7315,2451,2044,"This set is really cute! The whole kit fits inside the original container, which has locks on the sides to keep it closed. Nice! It is easy to get all the pieces back in here, even after the kids have been playing with it. There is just enough space in there so you don't have to struggle to put it away. Inside are a set of instructions to get you started. You can build a boat following the little story, or follow the plans for other suggested designs.

I tested this with a 4 year old and a 2 year old and they both keep coming back to this set. I do have to say, it floats!! It really does float. This has become a favorite at bath time. While I am getting the tub ready, I let them build their boats. There are enough pieces to make 2 small boats to share. Once the bath is ready then they test their designs in the water. It is a ton of fun, and they are learning!!! They don't know this, but they are learning balance and flotation. They will make one side too heavy and it sinks, so the next time they fix it and it floats. Lesson learned!!

After the bath I rinse these out with the rest of the tub toys and hang them in a tub to dry. I use one of those hospital tubs I got when I was in labor and just punched holes in the bottom. We have a rack in our tub for shampoo and stuff, so I emptied the bottom shelf and just put this up there. Everything dries out in about a day. No mildew or anything on the boat set that I have noticed and it's been months now.

I love learning toys, and especially ones that are fun. Both of my girls are able to assemble these on their own for the most part. Sometimes the pieces are a little hard to push together so they ask for me help. That's the only reason for the 4 star review instead of 5. It the pieces could fit a little smoother together then it would be a 5 star toy. The instructions are easy for younger kids to follow. Tons of pictures and close-ups.

Overall this is a nice set, and I would recommend it to anybody with kids that like to build. It works just like the block sets out there, except you are building a boat that floats! Very cool. If everything fit together smoother then this would be 5 stars. Nothing else not to like about this set.

I got this game as part of a birthday present for 3-year-old twins. We are going camping with the twins so I wanted to get them toys that are great activities to keep them entertained. When this arrived, I was so elated! This is a lot bigger than the one I had growing up. The one I had was 1/3 of the size. This is perfect for 3-year-olds since the pieces aren't too small and they seem easier to ""fish."" The colors are vibrant and bold. The pieces look good quality, and honestly....YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE. This is a great add-on item. It's a no-brainer.

The painting could be more detailed, even thought the costumes offers all the correct lines. The mistakes that are the most notable - the collar at the back of the coat should be golden, not green, and the golden necklace on the front is not painted. These mistakes are easy to correct with some golden paint of your own, I have modified mine to fit the real coat because it looks so much better like that. I am the type of collector who enjoys dusting of my figures, but I think what I did might make some puritans cringe. But if you are like me, you can make it as close to the original as it could get.

7936,2629,2459,"Ron in his Yule robe is one of the most detailed HP Pops out there. It has a lot of nice touches, the most important being the vest. It has an intricate print, very well made and wonderfully contrasting with the pink cuffs. The robe material, even though it is made out of plastic, has a fabric quality - there are many carvings that make it look crumpled and well worn. Even though the robe is not like described in the books (it is a replica of the one worn by the character in the fourth film), it is amazingly wizardish - you would not see a muggle wearing this, that is for sure.
The hair is the same unrealistic orange all the Weasley Pops have, it is long and slightly wavy, a bit boyish and very well made. The colour is not problematic, it stands out beautifully.
The skin is a little too tanned for the red hair, but it fits nicely with the overall figure.
The size of the figure is bigger than its counterparts (Harry and Hermione). In a way, it is fidel to the books, because Ron was the tallest of them all, towering over his friends.
It is a good quality figure, great to put on a shelf somewhere visible. It is, I think, the best portrayal of Ron Weasley in the whole HP Pop series, and definitely worth buying.",1519603200,5,ron yule robe one detail hp pop lot nice touch import vest intric print well made wonder contrast pink cuff robe materi even though made plastic fabric qualiti mani carv make look crumpl well worn even though robe like describ book replica one worn charact fourth film amazingli wizardish would see muggl wear sure hair unrealist orang weasley pop long slightli wavi bit boyish well made colour problemat stand beauti skin littl tan red hair fit nice overal figur size figur bigger counterpart harri hermion way fidel book ron tallest tower friend good qualiti figur great put shelf somewher visibl think best portray ron weasley whole hp pop seri definit worth buy

You are NOT going to find each item on each card - that's not the point of the game.  We have played this with many of our adult friends and with tons of kids (like I said my 2 year old is so good at this game and finds the most intricate details).

Also, it's really hard to install software on certain devices - my phone was incompatible and my daughter's tablet wasn't either, galaxy tab 3. I had to download a previous version from some third party website, installed it and then it would update thru regular play store.

8004,2629,93,"Even though one might think this figure has a healthy-looking skin colour (like it seems in the photos provided in the description), the actual figure is pale and a little greenish-yellow. It looks like the character has not stood in the sun for a long time, it is a very nice touch considering Sirius' story. He is dressed in a ill-matched suit, combining different textures in ways one wouldn't normally do. It looks eccentric, yet not as impressive as it would be expected of someone who has inherited as much money as him. It has class, yet it looks really wizardish, like he did not know what to do with the clothes.
The overall appearance is unkept, missmatched and a tad ill, so fitting for the Sirius we meet during Harry's era. He looks like one who had seen better days, and this figure has so much of this quality. It looks good next to his friend, Lupin, who is equally worst-for-wear. They complement each other nicely, so Sirius is a good figure for anyone who enjoyed him in the Harry Potter universe.",1519603200,5,even though one might think figur healthylook skin colour like seem photo provid descript actual figur pale littl greenishyellow look like charact stood sun long time nice touch consid siriu stori dress illmatch suit combin differ textur way one wouldnt normal look eccentr yet impress would expect someon inherit much money class yet look realli wizardish like know cloth overal appear unkept missmatch tad ill fit siriu meet harri era look like one seen better day figur much qualiti look good next friend lupin equal worstforwear complement nice siriu good figur anyon enjoy harri potter univers

The hair is light and it is gathered in a detailed braid at the back, very much like the film and comic books character. Mjolnir, the hammer, is carved and looks good, it does not seem made of plastic nor does it look cheap. The overall appearance is wonderful.

The design was approved by the Audubon Society.  I'll grant that the colouring is somewhat realistic. The bird does have the signature reddish-brown tail. And it's true that I have only seen the real-life raptors from a distance.  However when I look at this bird straight on, I see a cute, huggable toy with an adorable, quizzical expression -- not a bird of prey.

It also has comical, oversized ""feet,"" which allow it to stand alone -- not anything remotely like the deadly talons found on hawks.

The real selling point is the accurate sound -- which is spot on.  If you go to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology web site, you can listen to recordings of the red-tailed hawk in the wild.  The call you hear when you press this stuffed toy is exactly how the natural call sounds.

8032,2665,471,"I'm not a plastic fan. I really try to limit plastic in our house and, in doing so, waited a very long time to get these. A family member wanted to give to our LO as a gift, so I ordered as I knew she liked them from using them at school. We had once told friends that we were going to leave them for a school-only toy and we were told that of all the toys we could focus on that we should add these to our collection. They said the only thing we'd regret was not getting them sooner. Well, they were right. LO was so thrilled to get these and they have been used daily. I have even purchased two expansion packs so she can build bigger things. They really are great toys for creativity, understanding angles and how things works together, etc. And they are so useful when you need to cook or clean or do something that LO doesn't want to or can't be involved. Just point your child in this direction and s/he will be happy. Honestly, they are taken out without any prodding and so many things have been built. It is amazing to watch the brain just hum while using these. A reluctant (do to the high plastic footprint) huge fan.

We invested in these versus other magnetic sets that might be cheaper because a school teacher shared that some of the more economical sets don't build as well as the magnets don't hold as strongly and pieces fall more easily; and that the magnets are at increased risk of falling out. We have pets in the house and don't want anyone swallowing small magnets. We also don't want to provide a toy that creates frustration because it can't hold.

The only thing I will say is this is an expensive toy/habit, as the price point is high for what they can build with the sets. Even with this 100-piece set our LO was looking for more with her very first build. Also, the set doesn't include enough of the large pieces. To stabilize some builds, depending on what your intended child does with these, those will be needed. And I think many will find this need. They sell them in expansion packs of 8 pieces each and we've already bought two of those - $50 for 16 pieces! Do the math with this set at 100 pieces and something seems a bit off. With each new set of these we buy I can see that we'll also need to invest in those too, which is a rather hefty price tag all at once. Would be nice to see them available at a better price or in bundle packages with a cost reduction for the higher count purchase built in, as they are really pricey for only 8 pieces.

All in all, this is such a great toy for kids (just please never throw away... so many people want these that they can be reused by friends and family or schools or daycare centers, as well as many others. they are plastic so my only worry is not having these end up in a landfill).",1519689600,4,im plastic fan realli tri limit plastic hous wait long time get famili member want give lo gift order knew like use school told friend go leav schoolonli toy told toy could focu add collect said thing wed regret get sooner well right lo thrill get use daili even purchas two expans pack build bigger thing realli great toy creativ understand angl thing work togeth etc use need cook clean someth lo doesnt want cant involv point child direct happi honestli taken without prod mani thing built amaz watch brain hum use reluct high plastic footprint huge fan invest versu magnet set might cheaper school teacher share econom set dont build well magnet dont hold strongli piec fall easili magnet increas risk fall pet hous dont want anyon swallow small magnet also dont want provid toy creat frustrat cant hold

If the past is any indication of what will happen with this LEGO set prior to retirement (when the set is no longer sold), you'll have the opportunity to pick this set up at 30-40% off.

Before I get into quality and stuff, I'll cut to the most important part - my son loves this. He loves it in pieces or put together. It became an immediate favorite.

The packaging and look are really nice if you're considering it for a gift. I say that because if you want to buy wooden toys, it's hard to know what to get since so many people already have Melissa and Doug. Again, nice to have a less popular alternative.

8475,1012,1536,"This is a great little activity set to do with young kids. There are several different animal masks (fox, rabbit, bear, owl, raccoon among others), all plain white, for children to decorate and color. There is a sheet of decorative stickers you can use on the masks as well. The masks are made of a tag board material- it's thicker than regular paper, but still plenty sturdy for some rough treatment by kids. The kit also comes with elastics to tie around the mask so it will stay on.

Now my son is two and a half and he loves these masks! I've only let him do one so far (the rabbit) and he is just obsessed with put his mask on and pretending to be a rabbit (and of course also with taking it off and surprising us all that it was not really a giant rabbit, but him all along. :) ).  He colored on it with crayon and used the sticks (so it does not look nearly as nice as the masks on the box) but he loves it. And it has held up well despite him constantly putting it on and taking it off. I did have to staple the ears on as he ripped them by mistake.

One note I have is that the box makes it seem that the masks come as colored paper and you put them together. At least that's what I thought. Those mass in the product picture don't look like they are colored white paper. They look like colored paper. I thought you would have to construct the masks from different pieces, but the masks are pretty much one piece, except for the odd rabbit ears or owl beak. You just poke out the eyes and color the mask and attach the elastic and you are good to go.",1519862400,5,great littl activ set young kid sever differ anim mask fox rabbit bear owl raccoon among other plain white child decor color sheet decor sticker use mask well mask made tag board materi thicker regular paper still plenti sturdi rough treatment kid kit also come elast tie around mask stay son two half love mask ive let one far rabbit ob put mask pretend rabbit cours also take surpris u realli giant rabbit along color crayon use stick look nearli nice mask box love held well despit constantli put take stapl ear rip mistak one note box make seem mask come color paper put togeth least that thought mass product pictur dont look like color white paper look like color paper thought would construct mask differ piec mask pretti much one piec except odd rabbit ear owl beak poke eye color mask attach

You put jack in the middle of the mound of dirt and bury the carrots around. Then each person takes turns pulling a carrot out. One carrot ( it changes each time which is good) when pulled out will make Jack jump. You have to catch him before he hits the ground (which is the funnest part of the game).

It was easy to put together.  There is so much stuff included -- the desk can transform to an easel & chalkboard with storage space for art supplies.
Lots of songs/music/activities. 100 words.  Music plays very well.  Display lights up.  Interactive fun pages for learning/education and fun at the same time.  Colors are bright to keep an attention span.  It is like have three separate items (learning interactive desk/chalkboard/art station).
This is great for an almost  two year old toddler or older.  I really like the idea that you can purchase expansion packs in the future to keep the child learning more things and still keep interested.  It is sturdy and will be able to take a lot for a toddler/child.  A light touch of the buttons is all it takes to get them going so a youngster does not have to push hard.  FUN.  You do need the deluxe one to be able to use the expansion packs so if you want to purchase expansion packs make sure you buy the deluxe and not the standard desk.

There are two characters - an outdoorsy boy and girl, a pet dog, two camp chairs, a boat and a fishing rod. With batteries, the campfire lights up and plays music and sounds. The fishing rod can be moved to a variety of different spots (the boat, the dock etc.) and the bright colors keep him interested in play.

The quality and details in this set are great. It features a whimsical ""face"" on the front of the camper, and the latch on the back to keep it closed is also a spare tire. There's also a working door to the side of the camper!

8677,2131,1435,"lPass the Pigs is a small game where you roll pigs like dice to collect points. After each roll, you can pass the pigs to keep your points or roll again, but risk losing everything you gained that turn. The Big Pigs edition is the same game, but the pigs are 'roll on the floor' size bigger than the original game.

The game itself is fun, but I'm not sure the bigger pigs make the game any better.

Because they are huge, you need more space to play. If you have it, great. If you don't, your constantly trying to make sure you get a legit roll without the pig landing in an odd position.

The pigs themselves smell kinda funky too. Might go away after a while.

Overall, I think it's fine as a game, but the big pigs limit when and where you can play it. I'd stick with the regular size unless you think you'll have a space to play it in often.",1520035200,4,lpass pig small game roll pig like dice collect point roll pas pig keep point roll risk lose everyth gain turn big pig edit game pig roll floor size bigger origin game game fun im sure bigger pig make game better huge need space play great dont constantli tri make sure get legit roll without pig land odd posit pig smell kinda funki might go away overal think fine game big pig limit play id stick regular size unless think youll space play often

For that purpose, I think this quite a bit.  It's got a clip on it that'll work great for many things like strollers, crib, etc., but it's also a very safe type of clip.

It feels well-made.  Material is very soft.  I love the bright colors.  I think it's great.

8789,2911,591,"These were purchased as replacement ammo for our 10-year old son's Nerf Rival gun.  They were considerably less money than the brand name item and performance was spot on.  Our son claims they perform as well if not better than the rival ammo that came with his first gun.  He's had a few small jams but had the same problem with his initial nerf brand ammo, so the flaw appears to be with the gun, not the ammo.  I like the accompanying carry bag storage.  At first we were storing these little balls in an easy-to-grab container until we realized that the balls were disappearing after non-use. We quickly discovered that they fit perfectly in our cat's mouth and that she'd been stealing them from the container during the day when we were all at work and school.  The bag with carabiner clip allows us to store the balls and clip them high on the bunk bed to deter kitty theft.  (On that note, they do make GREAT cat toys as well.)  I can't vouch for the negative reviews on this product.  We've already gotten our money's worth and have used them solidly for several months now.  I'd buy again without hesitance.",1520121600,5,purchas replac ammo 10year old son nerf rival gun consider le money brand name item perform spot son claim perform well better rival ammo came first gun he small jam problem initi nerf brand ammo flaw appear gun ammo like accompani carri bag storag first store littl ball easytograb contain realiz ball disappear nonus quickli discov fit perfectli cat mouth shed steal contain day work school bag carabin clip allow u store ball clip high bunk bed deter kitti theft note make great cat toy well cant vouch neg review product weve alreadi gotten money worth use solidli sever month id buy without hesit

He knows where I store it and is constantly pointing at it in his closet and demanding to play with it.  The book itself is slightly larger than most sticker books (14""x11"") but still fits in a backpack when we take it with us on trips.  The book has 15 different pages with place settings printed on them and several pages with stickers for different themes (breakfast, pizza, burgers/hot dogs, dessert, etc).  The stickers themselves are large (except for a few) and were very easy for my toddler to handle.  Its always so disappointing when I order a sticker book online with a specific number of stickers and when you receive it and find out that over half of them are so tiny my toddler can't even handle them and just gets them stuck on one finger and then another, fortunately this book did not have that problem.  The stickers are not reusable, which was perfect from me because my toddler has a hard time getting a lot of the reusable stickers to stick to their page and not to his hand...Overall we are very happy with this purchase.  I plan on purchasing several more.

For a younger baby (first baths, etc) or for an older baby closer to a year old, these blow up ones just work out so much better. You can get the baby in and out easily, they can lay more comfortably and they're a little roomier so when the baby is a little bigger it still works out. We also have the whale version and it has held up so well. This swan version is really cute too and I am hoping it holds up just as well. The almost 8 month old can sit and play in it and the one month old can be bathed in it just as easily. It's nice because it has nice big rounded edges that are so much more comfortable for the babies whether they're laying propped on them or sitting against them.  For the one month old we use one of the plush flower inserts and prop him and he stays put so much better than in one of the hard plastic baby tubs.

Puzzle style is random shape (odd shapes) pieces which are very large.
Difficulty level is average to easy.
Puzzle quality is acceptable.  I had some bent pieces and quite a few pieces that weren't cut apart.  The bent pieces were not too bad, but if you like to glue and frame your puzzles, this could be an issue for you.
First, make sure you noted how big this puzzle is.  I had to go out and buy a large board because the puzzle was too large for my puzzle table.  At first I thought this puzzle was going to be difficult, because the sky and the roof were tricky because of all the odd shaped pieces.  However, here is a tip to make it easier.  Sort the pieces into containers based on the individual rooms or the levels of the house.  For instance, put the attic and playroom pieces in one container, the upstairs bedrooms and bathroom in another, and so on.  Once I did that the puzzle went very quickly.  One funny thing, the unfortunate people who live in this house only have one chair, and that is in the servants' quarters.  The poor old lady in the master bedroom has to stand.  Do the guests who are coming up the front stairs know they will have to stand, even at dinner because there is a dining room table with no chairs?  After I had purchased this puzzle, I discovered Ravensberger puzzles also makes a puzzle with the same picture.  (I've noticed this sort of thing before where the same picture will be sold by an American company and a European company.)  Had I known Ravensberger had this picture I would have definitely bought it from them because their puzzle quality is much better.  I did really enjoy this picture.",1520294400,4,puzzl size 39 x 27 wow puzzl style random shape odd shape piec larg difficulti level averag easi puzzl qualiti accept bent piec quit piec werent cut apart bent piec bad like glue frame puzzl could issu first make sure note big puzzl go buy larg board puzzl larg puzzl tabl first thought puzzl go difficult sky roof tricki odd shape piec howev tip make easier sort piec contain base individu room level hous instanc put attic playroom piec one contain upstair bedroom bathroom anoth puzzl went quickli one funni thing unfortun peopl live hous one chair servant quarter poor old ladi master bedroom stand guest come front stair know stand even dinner dine room tabl chair purchas puzzl discov ravensberg puzzl also make puzzl pictur ive notic sort thing pictur sold american compani european compani known ravensberg pictur would definit bought puzzl qualiti

The thing is, all the hard work of making a terrarium has been done for you:

- Some ventilation holes punched out of the jar lid
- Seed selection made, with seeds that grow quickly and are sized well (with respect to grown size) for the terrarium
- Soil and pebbles clean and bright
- etc.

This lets kids get down to the fun part, i.e. actually putting everything together and then watering and watching, while skipping the parts of the project that might bore them if you did this from scratch (i.e. the adult having to track down a mason jar, matching lid, and then punch holes in it with a hammer and nail, for example).

The final result is attractive, the seeds in our kit grew quickly (about 24 hours in we had sprouts) and well, and it was manageable for kids, who were able to take ownership of the project and feel proud of the results.

It's cheap, it looks good, it works, and it teaches something about biology/botany and something about responsibility (e.g. watering to keep the plans growing).

9244,3025,3480,"Having assembled several wood puzzles i have to warn potential buyers that this is one the most fragile wood puzzles that i have assembled so far. Several parts cracked during assembly, but none are visible on the final assembled product. It is still a very rewarding build, and artistic types will be able to color and personalize the tower with ease. After 3 hours of testing though, i think i would pass on this product in the future, and purchase a taller dice tower made out of a more sturdy material instead.

The 4 stars is because after 300 rolls, a fair dice (according to the salt water test) still resulted with results ranging from 38 to 64 occurrences, where the theoretical occurrences for all outcomes is 50. I also did this with a dice i knew to be biased and the dice tower was unfortunately unable to noticeably remove the bias. Without a deeper understanding of statistics (and admittedly small sample pool), my observations lead to believe that this dice tower biases otherwise fair dice. It's still perfectly serviceable for casual use, but if you're looking for true randomization, i would look elsewhere.

The 3 stars is because of the item's durability. The laser cut design weakens the surface of the plywood, making it more susceptible to cracking. This is unfortunately a material property of plywood, and is difficult to account for. Upon comparison to other plywood puzzles, the laser design is much deeper, but the material itself is equally thicker in an attempt to compensate.

9254,1571,519,"There are several kinds of games for young kids:

- Games that stretch them intellectually
- Games that are just silly fun
- Games that every kid loves
- Games that only some kids love
- Games that adults can love too
- Games that adults will not love

This game is silly fun (not intellectual), is a game that only some kids love (others are bored because it is quite monotonous if the single gag doesn't get you), and it is not a game that adults will love (it's pretty much at the intellectual level of a cat or dog).

I have one kid in the house that loves this game, and it's pretty much because of the silly visuals and tactility. It's spaghetti noodles. And a little plastic ""yeti"" with a crazy look on its face. Ha ha! The one kid that loves this game finds endless amusement in these facts, and as a result, wants to play this game endlessly, laughing and laughing.

The other kid, who's actually younger, at five years old, is bored out of his mind by this game. And he says it's because ""the game is easy, you do the same thing over and over, and nothing happens.""

Which pretty much sums it up.

He's not wrong. The fact that a five-year-old says this gives a good indication about how an adult is likely to feel about repeated playings of this game. Some weaknesses:

- There are only two variations on noodle shapes
- The noodles are still and actually relatively straight, meaning that play is very easy
- The limited weight of the yeti and the feather-like non-weight of the bowl mean that victory/loss are often ambiguous
- The shape of the noodles and bowl mean that there is almost no variation in game-start conditions or play

This *could* have been a really fun game with more noodle shapes to make it a bit more interesting/challenging and to vary the initial game setup a bit more, and with a heavier yeti and/or bowl to ensure that a loss is clear as a loss (i.e. that it's as clear as day when the yeti falls and the bowl stays put where it's supposed to as you play).

Instead, it comes across less as a serious ""game"" to be played, won, or lost, and more like a ""gag"" gameit's more on the scatalogical ""fun because we're playing with food and a yeti"" footing than it is on a ""we're playing a game with each other"" footing.

Would I buy again? Probably not. But if you have a kid that seems excited about playing with noodles and a yeti, it may still be a good buy for your particular family.",1520294400,3,sever kind game young kid game stretch intellectu game silli fun game everi kid love game kid love game adult love game adult love game silli fun intellectu game kid love other bore quit monoton singl gag doesnt get game adult love pretti much intellectu level cat dog one kid hous love game pretti much silli visual tactil spaghetti noodl littl plastic yeti crazi look face ha ha one kid love game find endless amus fact result want play game endlessli laugh laugh kid who actual younger five year old bore mind game say game easi thing noth happen pretti much sum he wrong fact fiveyearold say give good indic adult like feel repeat play game weak two variat noodl shape noodl still actual rel straight mean play easi limit weight yeti featherlik nonweight bowl mean victoryloss often ambigu shape noodl bowl mean almost variat gamestart condit play could

9382,3076,71,"Terraforming Mars is a strategy game for 1-5 players designed by Jacob Fryxelius and published by FryxGames. The game has of nominations an awards from various groups given its initial release.

In the 2400s big corporations have taken on the challenge of terraforming Mars for human habitaion as commissioned by the World Government of Earth. Players represent different corporations each with their own specializations. Progress in the terraforming effort is measured by one's TR or Terraforming Rating and this is typically raised by increasing the temperature of the planet, increasin the oxygen level or adding ocean tiles to the hexagonal map that represents Mars.

Players take turns purchasing cards to use from a random card draft and then playing them by paying the associated costs. These help players build up resource production across various areas like steel, titanium or even plants in order to aid with their terraforming efforts. Plays can also create cities on the planet's surface or possibly on some of the moons of Mars for other resources. Once the planet has maxed out temperature, oxygen and has run out of ocean tiles, players complete scoring and the corporation with the highest TR wins.

What I Like: The game is brilliant in its diversity between the different corporation abilities and the fact that the all project cards in the game are unique, and thus it's hard to develop a specific strategy until you have your next draft of cards in hand. As much as the card draft is an optional mechanic for more experienced playes, we now find it to be a great addition to the overall game experience. And thus every game feels unique as you all endeavor to make the most points while managing Mars.

The balance between expected resource production, meeting the prerequisites or avoiding the limitations of cards while competing with other players for key space on Mars is what drives the game and you know that a lot of love went into the design of this game given the many instances when you find yourself short a resource or two trying to accomplish everything you want to do within a single term. It's also competitive but not overly so and thus the greater challenge is ensuring that your assets on Mars benefit you as best as possible.

What Could Be Better: First, card art is a little inconsitent. Some are interesting photo images. Some are rather weird Photoshop creations. Some are tasteful vectors. Others feel like nearly random symbols. And it's a seemingly  minor point aboutt the game and sure the gameplay is more important but given  how much of the game centers around the cards, it can get a little tiring at times. At least most of the symbols are consistent enough for easy interpretation of how things work, but beyond  that the game ends up feeling a little cheap. Hopefully it has beome successful enough to merit a stronger second edition or something.

And depending on who you play with, there may be some frustation with the lack of more direct player-vs-player options. This is not to say the game needs more of this mechanic, but there are a number of cards whose effects can be perceived to be more PVP and the limited number of such cards makes the PVP moments stand out a bit more in a somewhat awkward fashion. For the most part you really need to focus on building your power base of sorts to get the game going and PVP stuff seem incidental and at times unnecessary.

TL;DR: Terraforming Mars offers a distinct gaming flavor that is definitly a unique brand of strategy. Every game is different and will certainly challenge the players of your game table and the expansions that have come out for the game thus far continue to add a clever, fun vibe to things.",1520380800,5,terraform mar strategi game 15 player design jacob fryxeliu publish fryxgam game nomin award variou group given initi releas 2400 big corpor taken challeng terraform mar human habitaion commiss world govern earth player repres differ corpor special progress terraform effort measur one tr terraform rate typic rais increas temperatur planet increasin oxygen level ad ocean tile hexagon map repres mar player take turn purchas card use random card draft play pay associ cost help player build resourc product across variou area like steel titanium even plant order aid terraform effort play also creat citi planet surfac possibl moon mar resourc planet max temperatur oxygen run ocean tile player complet score corpor highest tr win like game brilliant diver differ corpor abil fact project card game uniqu thu hard develop specif strategi next draft card hand much card draft option mechan experienc play find great addit overal game experi thu everi game feel uniqu endeavor make point manag mar balanc expect resourc product meet prerequisit avoid

The friend of mine had the same ones but those were brighter and a bit thicker, so didn't get this messy so fast. But if you do give only two colors at a time - everything is pretty nice. My baby is 7 months now, so she really liked these anyways. These are non-toxic, but if you still are worried that baby might eat them - I don't think she/he will keep on eating after the first taste. They smell like garlic a bit )) my sweetheart didn't taste them (Im surprised about that) but she did rub her hands on her mouth a bit, but I was ready for that mess )))) its natural.

When you fall behind there is no mechanism to catch back up. You often have lost after initial city placement even if you don't realize it. Trading is lackluster - don't trade with the leader(s) and the leader usually is far enough ahead not to need to trade with the 2nd place player. Area control with roads is interesting but usually not possible for most players (at least 1 player always starts without wood and brick). This game would be more interesting with more resources to use, more strategic decisions about how to use those resources (rather than just playing as soon as possible), a larger board allowing for more area control, revamped trading rules to encourage trading, and a catch-up mechanism for the last place player.

9582,1672,3544,"I bought this as a ""playpen"" for my gerbils. I previously had the red version that saw plenty of use, but eventually it was too tattered by rogue chewing that the seams were more duct tape than fabric, so it was time to replace it. That being said, if you plan on using it for your small pets, I recommend this ball pit. The walls are a decent height, though my gerbils can leap just high enough to impossibly perch on the thin walls; the metal frame is pretty sturdy when it comes to holding the weight of a gerbil. It's also important to keep an eye on your pets when in use, as rodents like to chew the seams in the corners, which can make for a quick escape as well.

The material is not water resistant, so if your pet has an accident, it will leak to the surface below (don't set this on carpet). However, it is easy to clean with cleanser and a towel, just be sure to wipe the underside of the fabric and the floor. I also keep a dish of sand in here for them to play in, and the flexibility of the pit makes it easy to fold and dump/brush excess sand into the trash.

My gerbils like having the freedom of this pit to stretch out and run around (more than a run-about ball), and it sound hilarious when they tear off full speed and run the circumference like a motorcycle on the Wall of Death.",1520467200,5,bought playpen gerbil previous red version saw plenti use eventu tatter rogu chew seam duct tape fabric time replac said plan use small pet recommend ball pit wall decent height though gerbil leap high enough imposs perch thin wall metal frame pretti sturdi come hold weight gerbil also import keep eye pet use rodent like chew seam corner make quick escap well materi water resist pet accid leak surfac dont set carpet howev easi clean cleanser towel sure wipe undersid fabric floor also keep dish sand play flexibl pit make easi fold dumpbrush excess sand trash gerbil like freedom pit stretch run around runabout ball sound hilari tear full speed run circumfer like motorcycl wall death

9937,1620,2503,"Accustrike Alphahawk Comprehensive Review

This is Amazons Toy of the Year 2017 winner for the Outdoors category.  But does the Accustrike Series Alphahawk live up to that prestigious title?  Here, I have purchased one and done a comprehensive review on it for you just to find out.  The Alphahawk is a springer type blaster that has a fairly stealthy operation and obviously nice accuracy, but the good accuracy is almost entirely due to the Accustrike darts that it comes with (10, so it is a double-your-darts deal).  There is a sling-mount under the shoulder stock, which is the only sling attachment point on the entire blaster (unless you count the circular ring of the front iron-sight).  Like the fixed shoulder stock, it has a long fixed barrel that does not allow for any attachments as some of the other Nerf blasters may have.  There are two tactical rails on the blaster: 1 under the barrel, and 1 on top of the blaster just above the dual side priming handles.  The two grey plastic nubs that arrived separately from the blaster shell are (one-directional, reference the directions in the manual) important tabs that serve as the blasters priming handles and be mindful not to lose them because they are on the tiny side.  These stick out of the sides of the blaster, they can be detached once installed by use of a flathead screwdriver thanks to a slot above the priming handle (good move there, Nerf engineers).  I decided to only attach the left one for ease of transportation.  Personal preference.  I like that the priming handle is fairly easy to prime and has an auto-return spring to return the priming handle for you once the blaster is primed.  One interesting discovery of mine was that the cylinder rotated upon the release of the main trigger.  This is not an issue or complaint, its just something that I noticed that was different from the previous revolvers Nerf made.  The main pistol grip has a solid finger-guard that surprisingly enough doesnt cramp my fingers, but perhaps it would be cramped for those who have very large hands.  Overall ergonomics of the pistol grip I still find to be uncomfortable despite the soft rubber parts of the handle.  This is mainly because of the unnecessary orange plastic lip design at the top of the pistol grip.  My fingers have to deal with enough ridges and bumps on the trigger as well, so I feel that not enough effort was put towards the design.  It is annoying that I have to feel that jutting edge on my hand and thumb during operation.  This goes to show that you cannot simply put rubber cushion pads on the handle and expect it to provide superior ergonomics.  Anyway, moving on.  This blaster reminds me of the Nerf Doomlands Impact Zone Longarm (Target exclusive) and the Elite Spectre (an old Walmart exclusive which the Longarm was a re-shell of), due to the 5-dart revolving cylinder that can be popped slightly out of the left side of the blaster when the gray cylinder-release button (also located on the left, immediately behind the cylinder) is pressed.  As stated before, it comes with Accustrike darts, but it is also compatible with the Nerf Elite blue, green, orange, white, purple/grey, Starwars-themed, and decorated Rebelle darts.  Despite having a long and aerated/ vented barrel, the darts will fly right through it without affecting the ranges of the shots.  Apparently the long barrel is not thin like the Longarms, but like the Longarm, you only has 5 shots before you have to stop and reload.  This is frustrating during a Nerf War, and as it seems, Hasbro has yet to figure this out.  Not surprisingly, this blaster holds the least amount of darts that any Nerf revolver can hold, and is in competition with the likes of the Longarm and Spectre because... it not so secretly IS one, just reimagined and given better darts.  Oddly enough, this rifle has an average dart velocity rating around 60 feet per second (FPS) as recorded by my ProChrono Digital chronograph.  While I was not surprised at this velocity reading, I was still disappointed.  The standard average for an Elite blasters velocity is rated at 70 FPS.  I had high hopes that the Alphahawk would put out the same or more than the Longarms beefy velocity of 72 FPS, or the Spectre's 64 FPS.  I must mention that my 6-dart Elite Strongarm (Dart-pistol) sidearm is averaging 69 FPS and holds one more dart, just to give you an idea of how disadvantaged the Alphahawk stands up against a comparable revolving flip-open-cylinder blaster.  Conclusion:  is the Accustrike Series Alphahawk deserving of any awards whatsoever?  In my opinion...  No.  A revolver rifle that is both weaker and has a smaller dart capacity than a sidearm, yet having the bulkiness and length of a primary is not my idea of an Outdoors Toy of the Year recipient.  The Alphahawks 64 FPS brethren, the Raptorstrike, is better than it by leaps and bounds with its magazine system (inaccurately called CS, or Clip System in the past by Nerf) and functional mag storage capabilities integrated into its shoulder stock.  The final straw for me was the poorly designed ergonomics of the Alphahawks handle, and it is for these reasons that the Alphahawk cannot compete with most of the other blasters.  I am forced to give this blaster my mark-of-shame rating of 2-stars.  The only way this could get less stars is if it doesnt work properly or breaks easily.  I may return to re-evaluate this review if I find anything of value or something of interest to add to it (review posted 3-10-2018).",1520726400,2,accustrik alphahawk comprehens review amazon toy year 2017 winner outdoor categori accustrik seri alphahawk live prestigi titl purchas one done comprehens review find alphahawk springer type blaster fairli stealthi oper obvious nice accuraci good accuraci almost entir due accustrik dart come 10 doubleyourdart deal slingmount shoulder stock sling attach point entir blaster unless count circular ring front ironsight like fix shoulder stock long fix barrel allow attach nerf blaster may two tactic rail blaster 1 barrel 1 top blaster dual side prime handl two grey plastic nub arriv separ blaster shell onedirect refer direct manual import tab serv blaster prime handl mind lose tini side stick side blaster detach instal use flathead screwdriv thank slot prime handl good move nerf engin decid attach left one ea transport person prefer like prime handl fairli easi prime autoreturn spring return prime handl blaster prime one interest discoveri mine cylind rotat upon

This is so much better than where everything seems to center around the fact that they can say a few phrases or wet themselves or whatever ...  That gets old.

This doll is wonderful because it's a beautiful well-weighted doll that is perfect even without the giggle -  but then it also giggles! And giggles are much better in pretend play than set phrases.",1520812800,5,great littl doll cute like babi girl doll isnt princessi giggl well done unlik mani doll trick doll giggl almost hidden child could easili go day play doll without know giggl hug around tummi much better everyth seem center around fact say phrase wet whatev get old doll wonder beauti wellweight doll perfect even without giggl also giggl giggl much better pretend play set phrase

Now, they don't remember the difference between a general nut and a lug nut, but they do remember how to completely take this apart and put it back together. My 2 year old can do this alone. Yes, I am serious. She is more apt with tools than her sister though.

The screwdriver is simple to use, just a trigger mechanism and then a switch up front labeled ""off"" to put the drill in reverse. For some reason this trips up my 4 year old on occasions but a quick reminder and she is good to go. I have the original batteries in there and they use it all the time. It has a regulator in it to prevent over-tightening so no worries about your kids breaking anything.

When you first open this, you might need to hand loosen some of the nuts, the factory assembly is a little more snug than the toy screwdriver can handle. We only had an issue with a few nuts the first time, and no issues since. Everything stores back in the car and the box easily enough. You can fit ""Little People"" inside this car if it is apart. My girls love shoving different ones in there all the time and then driving them around the house. This car has been dropped, spilled on, kicked, stepped on, etc. Nothing broke. I was sure that back panel would have snapped but it held up. This is durable, relatively quiet, and really fun. I enjoy playing with it with the kids too!! I highly recommend this to any parent.",1520899200,5,test girl age 4 2 tell 2 year old love 4 year old howev enjoy play regularli husband mechan beyond thrill receiv toy girl happili sat explain went togeth take apart correct term everyth dont rememb differ gener nut lug nut rememb complet take apart put back togeth 2 year old alon ye seriou apt tool sister though screwdriv simpl use trigger mechan switch front label put drill revers reason trip 4 year old occas quick remind good go origin batteri use time regul prevent overtighten worri kid break anyth first open might need hand loosen nut factori assembl littl snug toy screwdriv handl issu nut first time issu sinc everyth store back car box easili enough fit littl peopl insid car apart girl love shove differ one time drive around hous car drop spill kick step etc

Cups and little teddy bears especially...but my husband watched her carefully that she put the bear into her mouth several times and very worried that she could swallow it accidentally and being chocked.

Add more, the edge of the dice is very very sharp surprisingly. it could hurt her eyes when she plays with it. we had to keep watching her while her playing with it....so, we also put that away from her for a while....
The company should really consider the size of the teddy bear when they make, and the safety issues of the dice design in future. they should make it more smooth and soft at the edge parts. we are keeping this toy anyway since she likes the cups... so we will wait for another months she can handle it by herself.",1520899200,4,toddler 19 month month love toy cup littl teddi bear especiallybut husband watch care put bear mouth sever time worri could swallow accident chock put away except color cup add edg dice sharp surprisingli could hurt eye play keep watch play itso also put away compani realli consid size teddi bear make safeti issu dice design futur make smooth soft edg part keep toy anyway sinc like cup wait anoth month handl

They fly great(6 mins avg)Indoors, (with no fans/heaters moving air) any air movements affect them drastically!!, just be sure to buy the ""S107 G "". they work well and have an excellent Gyro stabilization system compared to previous models. They are very rugged/tough, BUT... The worst thing you can do is let them hit the Ceiling !!! The weighted Balance bar, which is on the top, (looks like a long dumbell) has 2 small links that attach it to the uppermost mounting pad, the links don't break, but the uppermost mounting pad does. This stuff is small, but if you look Closely, you will see them. There are 2 links, with loops on each end that allow the balance bar to pivot and keep the Copter stable. If you hit the ceiling, as most do, these link points rub on the ceiling and the mounting pins break! I've had 7 of these, and this has been the #1 problem. If you are aware, and remember this one fault, you WILL be amazed as to the crashes these will endure. Best height for flight in a home is probably about 4 or 5 feet. Any higher and they get 'sucked' up to the ceiling in the warmer currents/thinner air up high. We have had many battles,crashes, and endless fun with these, and for the $ they won't break the bank.

They are a great size (see picture) and reduces the choking hazard risk and made with non toxic paint - they appear to be made very well with smoothe wood and are light enough as well. They have letters on two sides and math, animals, and pictures on the others. The letters / numbers are the only sides in color but the other sides are engraved as well, this will be perfect as my little one grows and explores. They stack well and offer many options for learning and playing.
They also come with a mesh carrying bag which I am not sure we would use but nice to have nonetheless.",1521072000,4,purchas 10 week old abl explor learn like come bright color search buy return set plea far great size see pictur reduc choke hazard risk made non toxic paint appear made well smooth wood light enough well letter two side math anim pictur other letter number side color side engrav well perfect littl one grow explor stack well offer mani option learn play also come mesh carri bag sure would use nice nonetheless

10557,2022,1940,"I grew up to the original Star Wars trilogy and saw them all in the theater, as well as had a few of the action figures. When they released the Star Wars Lego sets in 2000, I purchased quite a few of the various sets available. One of the sets that wasn't available at that time was the Imperial AT-AT. Back in November I did some searches for Star Wars Lego sets, in anticipation of Last Jedi and found the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEGO-Star-Wars-Episode-VIII-First-Order-Heavy-Assault-Walker-75189-Building-Kit-1376-Piece/dp/B07214T9NT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEGO Star Wars Episode VIII First Order Heavy Assault Walker 75189 Building Kit (1376 Piece)</a>; however, I couldn't bring myself to spending $150 on this set. While looking around at some of the various sets available I found this AT-ST walker on sale.

The instructions for this AT-ST Imperial Walker are easy to follow, with the various pieces added to the build displayed in their own box to make it simple to know what you need. Our two year old was more than excited to help with the assembly process and took the two of us approximately two hours to assemble. Once the entire AT-ST walker was put together I was pleasantly surprised with just how impressive in size that it is. I like how you can turn Baze Malbus and the Imperial AT-ST driver's heads around to show different expressions. There is a round Lego piece on the back of the pelvis that allows you to rotate the control cabin without directly interacting with it. Both of the side turrets and the front turret are able to be adjusted up and down.

The legs on this AT-ST walker, by default, can only move backwards; however, if you flip the 7x3 Technic pieces upside down, at the joint section of the leg, so the 3 are facing upwards, instead of down, then you will be able to bring the legs forward as well. I personally do not care for the spring loaded shooter aspects, but I can see how some children might have fun with it (careful Ralphie). I feel that they should've either included a regular Stormtrooper or replaced the Rebel Trooper with one, as this is an Imperial set and is heavy on the Rebel minifigs. I would've preferred that the decorative pieces had been printed on directly, instead of needing to place stickers on them.

If you are a Star Wars fan and enjoy putting together Lego sets then this is definitely a good investment for your collection. If you are new to Lego building then you should probably start with a few smaller sets before trying to tackle this one, as it does take a little bit of time and being familiar with the building process helps.

10576,2598,781,"Despite all the negative reviews, I purchased this product for my 3 year old son. Week 3, everything works. We all love it. The technology is very clever - the stylus pen activates the speaker to read a page of a book, to say individual words, letters and games. The stylus pen is a little cumbersome in size but its clever and my son can easily grasp it. The set up is straightforward but requires you to go online and download the books. It would have been nice to have had the system already loaded with the book collection but perhaps thats the manufactures way of enabling us to upload new books and technical updates, its not an issue. We purchased the learning to read book collection and the several of the kindergarten (space) books. 8 books in total, its not cheap. Excellent. Hours of fun guaranteed.

I will note that this is the second product to have arrived.

Now that I'm older, I was recently doing an inventory of the various Lego sets that we have and was able to take the sets apart; however, my fingers were rather raw and my fingernails definitely took some damage. I decided that it was time to see if there was an easier method for disassembling Lego sets. So I did a search, saw a video and was instantly sold on these orange brick and axel separator tools.

These brick and axel separators are amazing for removing the Lego pieces from each other, which turns the breakdown process into something pleasant and fun to do. The whole premise of how this works is simple physics and you just need the separator to apply pressure to the block that you attached this to. The rounded corners make it easy to remove pieces from the separator; however, if you have one that is giving you issues, just use another Lego piece, or separator, and you should be able to just go down along the curve until you reach the Lego piece to push it off. If you place this on top of a block, you then push down on the separator to separate and remove the block. If you place this underneath a block, you would then pull up on the separator. If you have a Technic piece inside of another Technic piece, you can use the axel remover to push the one out from the other; however, you should make sure that you start with the edge of the inner one to ensure that the beveled edge is released from the outer piece. If you have a smooth surface Lego attached, you can just use the flat part to go underneath the lip that's around the bottom edge that connects to the other piece to separate the two.

If you have any Lego pieces, then this is something I'd highly recommend; however, I will admit that they're at least slightly overpriced for what they are. Some of the various Lego sets do include the brick and axel separator,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEGO-Star-Wars-Episode-VIII-First-Order-Heavy-Assault-Walker-75189-Building-Kit-1376-Piece/dp/B07214T9NT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEGO Star Wars Episode VIII First Order Heavy Assault Walker 75189 Building Kit (1376 Piece)</a>&nbsp;for example, so that's one way to get a separator without buying these three.",1521158400,4,div idvideoblockr3c1zu53r940vn classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesia1kw2zwef2smp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi51gaow1pyspng classvideoslateimgurlnbspgrow rememb tri remov lego piec one extrem difficulti point id use teeth tool anyth el could think tri pri piec im older recent inventori variou lego set abl take set apart howev finger rather raw fingernail definit took damag decid time see easier method disassembl lego set search saw video instantli sold orang brick axel separ tool brick axel separ amaz remov lego piec turn breakdown process someth pleasant fun whole premis work simpl physic need separ appli pressur block attach round corner make easi remov piec separ howev one give issu use anoth lego piec separ abl go along curv reach lego piec push place top block push separ separ remov block place underneath block would pull separ technic piec insid anoth technic piec use axel remov push one howev

My boys are tough on EVERYTHING - including taking chunks out of my walls with bare hands - and they still haven't managed to break it. I don't like posting reviews right away when things arrive, gotta wait for the honeymoon phase to be over, and they're still in love after a few months!
Heres our personal experience with function and playability:
* Very sturdy construction. Nothing was misaligned or wobbly. All screws tightly secured, and even the hose was so well installed (and comprised of rigid yet flexible materials) you can tell by observation alone that its going to last a while.
* Reliable function! As stated above, the water flow and all the moving parts of the wall-mounted unit have functioned perfectly, even with whacking and throwing! The batteries haven't been replaced yet, though the power is waning, but I think any toy that is used nightly and lasts for a month or more is pretty impressive!
* As colorful as the description states. The lighting in the video is a little murky due to our soft white bulbs and I didn't want to add any filters, but wanted to reassure that it IS brightly colored. Consistent with what Ive seen in pics on other reviews.
* The impression right out of the box was a little disconcerting. It came wrapped in a plastic bag instead of having an integrated cover...maybe thats the way they all are? It was also much smaller than I anticipated but I didn't see measurements anywhere on post.
* Initial use was an absolute blast! They were entranced by it! Then the fighting ensued and made me wish Id gotten 2.
* Subsequent uses were still engaging, and theyve branched out into devising ways to create irritation using the molded lines and outcroppings in the tub. Whales get their baths, tea is served via sprayer on manual setting, and weve only had one incident where they thought the bath rug needed to be watered - its lime green and shaggy, bonus points for creativity!

There aren't many power toys out there for small hands, so I love that this toy promotes independence along with rule-following (Keep that thing in the tub!) and creativity. Im sure they will grow out of it by the time it dies but I would purchase for a friend and recommend it for every baby/toddler home!

This set includes a First Order Stormtrooper, Heavy Assault Stormtrooper, Gunner Crew Member and a regular Crew Member with an insignia, 4 minifigs in total. The First Order Turbolaser Turret is able to rotate around the base. Two of the sides open opposite from the other, with one side having a control console that can be rotated up and down and the other side is a storage location for the ammunition that can be fired from the turret and the minifig's weapons. The directions are clear and easy to follow, with the various pieces added to the build displayed in their own box to make it simple to know what you need. It took our two year old and me approximately 15 minutes to fully assemble this set.

If we were to reenact the scenes, the troops would have to make 12 to 13 times the trips through Jedda to get the proper amount of crystals to the cargo vessels.  Lego really blew it here with the trunk. The driver's area is secure from an LASER blasts, but the communications equipment is lacking.  This is a major design flaw because when the driver pops out of the hatch, he's (or she if you dress up the minifig appropriately) exposed to harsh weather, insults, and blaster fire, which is too great of a risk just to make a clear transmission. Additionally, the troopers who were integrated with this vehicle are well-armed and best-suited for operations that are combined with armored vehicles.

I love this water table for the fact that it has become an part of my sons outdoor play time. This was easy enough to assemble, everything pops into place with a little push and the only actually screwing I needed to do was screwing the spiral together with the hardware provided. The spiral works fine, as do the other little activities included. The balls are a cute touch as well as the red cup. I would have given this a 5 star review if it wasn't for the fact that one of the holes that the legs pop into was slightly dented when it arrived. Luckily I was able to bend it outwards to I could insert the leg in.

One is a counting app, another is addition/subtraction, and the third is mostly another counting app. You activate them using your numbers, so that it knows you bought them and don't have to pay for an app.

Our 5 year old daughter was very engaged in this for hours. The app voice is british, which she found cute. She would try to repeat her ""Tharteen"", letting us know she had an accent. It was cute and pleasant.

In each app there are 3 different skill levels. It's very adjustable based on your child's knowledge base, allowing you to move up if he/she masters the lower levels.

The numbers register instantly when placing them on the ipad screen. Think of these almost like ink stamps, though we did have to remind our daughter not to stamp <so> hard.

11145,2131,1428,"The ETA hand2mind Wood Dominoes set of six has been a welcome addition to our home. With three kids in our family having a big enough set of Domino's to share amongst them is a real win. These can be used for pattern practice, matching,  stacking/building aids, playing a game of Dominoes, math manipulatives and many other learning games and so forth at home or in the classroom that may call for such an item.

In this set, there are 6 sets of 28 (168 in all) Dominoes per color. The vibrant kid-appealing colors are red, black, blue, yellow, green, and orange. These are smaller than standard at 1-3/4"" x 3/4"" in size. All the pieces in this set can be stored in the plastic zip-top bag that came with it. The listing mentions a plastic storage bin but my set did not include one. Instructions on each individual colored box of the plastic sleeved Dominoes are included in how to play a game of Dominoes for two to four players.

The quality of this set is just okay. Some are perfect in sizing, shape, and depth while others are a little off not being straight edged and some dots on the tiles aren't perfectly centered either. I was surprised by the quality considering the price tag of 19.99 for the set. Sure, you are getting a lot of Dominoes but I wished they were a bit nicer physically. That being said, I don't worry about my children and their friends losing or damaging these accidentally where I would with a more professional set.

I do feel like these are a decent choice for children to use in the ways mentioned above if you don't mind some flaws. My kids have used these a lot and don't seem to be as picky about the quality as I am.",1521504000,3,eta hand2mind wood domino set six welcom addit home three kid famili big enough set domino share amongst real win use pattern practic match stackingbuild aid play game domino math manipul mani learn game forth home classroom may call item set 6 set 28 168 domino per color vibrant kidapp color red black blue yellow green orang smaller standard 134 x 34 size piec set store plastic ziptop bag came list mention plastic storag bin set includ one instruct individu color box plastic sleev domino includ play game domino two four player qualiti set okay perfect size shape depth other littl straight edg dot tile arent perfectli center either surpris qualiti consid price tag 1999 set sure get lot domino wish bit nicer physic said dont worri child friend lose damag accident would profession set feel like decent choic child use way mention dont mind flaw kid use lot dont seem

11379,2167,2188,"How helpful can it be to report these NECA stands were purchased for my NECA Alien & Predator figures, and that they worked just fine? Years ago, during the apex of my collecting days, the stands I found most versatile were those 2-3/4 (dia.) semitranslucent ones sold by McFarlane Toys. The plastic bases had a thicker pin that seemed to accommodate anything. Alas, they are discontinued.

These NECA bases measure 3-1/2 (dia.) x 1/8, with the allimportant thickness of the 3/16 tall pin being approx. 1/8 thick. But Im eyeballing it off a ruler and not using outside calipers. These days, most of what is left of my collection is in storage, but there was one tub of assorted figures available, and below is a random sampling of how these NECA stands fared:

It took a while to put together so make sure you have time and space to lay it all out. I was rather upset that the washer door had a chip in the paint. The instructions are picture instructions so make sure you look carefully and pay attention to the screws because some have colored tops and others that are the same screw don't. You have to figure out if the screw will be on the inside or outside because the instructions don't tell you. I had to go back and change some because when I was putting it together I didn't know if it would be seen or not. All in all aside from the chip in the door it is a great product and very sturdy.

and this is just right for him in both speed and quality .  it doesn't go too fast and is easy for him to control. But I guess once he gets the hang of scooting he will need an upgrade to go faster.

11772,2191,1316,"Got these crayons for little man. He just turned one and I'm trying to teach him how to color, even though he's still insistent that crayons are for eating. I get to do most of the actual coloring and I love the vibrancy of these crayons! They also smell so pleasant that they are a pleasure to use. Honestly, I'm not super into the organic lifestyle although I do buy organic when and where I can so it's a nice bonus to find crayons like these. These crayons put my mind at ease, for sure, especially when little dude decides to think of them as honey candy sticks.

I thought they would be a bit longer but it turns out that they are just the right size for him, not the right size for mommy :( I'm going to have to get a set of the thin ones for myself and by golly, I will! That's how much I like them. I've really never seen such vibrant colors. If you look at the page in the pictures you will see that some areas are a dull color and some are a rich color. The  areas shaded in rich colors are the ones with the honeysticks and the areas colored less brightly are colored with regular crayons. Maybe it's just me and my over-excitement about these crayons but I'm pretty sure there is a difference.

They are a bit pricey but ultimately worth it because so far it's kind of impossible to break them, which makes them totally worth their price. You only need to buy one set. Unless you're like me and you're going to buy a second set for yourself, that is... Do they make these for actual adults?

11788,3750,929,"Great game for a 2 year old.  You place 6 discs face down on the floor then ask them to find and bring you back only one of the six.  Its a first memory game for little ones.  The cons are: 1. the edges are very thin and my son sliced his finger the first time we played the game.  It was a deep cut but did not need stitches.  Since that time, we have had no issues.  If you want to prevent this, laminate the pieces again so they are thicker and play the game on carpet which is easier to pick the pieces up from.  2.  the sets are not expandable - all you get is six discs per color.  You can play with less than 6 discs at a time, but not more.  So this game has a limited life span since only the youngest kids who can remember 6 or less really should play it before going up to a larger memory game (that is expandable to much larger amounts).  3. The game works best with only one child at a time.  So this game can be awkward in school and family situations.  One solution would be to buy a set for every child so you can lay out multiple circles at the same time but that is a lot of money invested.  4.  If a child is tired, they will look under every card until they find the right object without using their memory at all... so only play this game when the child is alert and can focus.  For slightly older kids, one solution is to spread the discs farther and farther apart so they use more energy AND have more of an incentive to memorize/remember positions.  5.  The shapes were by far the hardest to remember so use those at a latter date and start with the photoed images first.  Overall, this was a good investment for us since our color printer died, I was sick with a toddler to care for, and my son does not have siblings to play with.  There was not a lot of effort on the parent side of things, so I was able to play this game while I was sick with a virus - all i had to do was sit and show a card while the child ran around finding the objects.",1521936000,3,great game 2 year old place 6 disc face floor ask find bring back one six first memori game littl one con 1 edg thin son slice finger first time play game deep cut need stitch sinc time issu want prevent lamin piec thicker play game carpet easier pick piec 2 set expand get six disc per color play le 6 disc time game limit life span sinc youngest kid rememb 6 le realli play go larger memori game expand much larger amount 3 game work best one child time game awkward school famili situat one solut would buy set everi child lay multipl circl time lot money invest 4 child tire look everi card find right object without use memori play game child alert focu slightli older kid one solut spread disc farther farther apart use energi incent memorizerememb posit 5 shape far hardest

12185,3847,2766,"We bought this for Christmas for our kids 2 and 4 and we bought it to use in our finished basement. Our kids love the trampoline park and bouncy houses and its good exercise. Plus some of the reviews on here talking about it being a nap marker sounded good to us. I searched from the biggest bounce house that could fit indoors and found this. It does fit indoors and really isn't to loud, I mean you are not watching tv next to it but it isn't obnoxious either. The height is perfect for complete safety in an 8 roommy kids cant jump as high as the top arches and they are a couple feet lower the ceiling. The size isn't to bad either we did bunch up the blower tube on the blowers flange to shorten it way down and get it tighter to a wall on that side. The bounce house is well made and nice looking. The kids love this thing and even bargain with us for time in it for dressing quickly or doing fast baths. It a nice non-food treat when we need it to be.  They really do burn off a ton of energy in it also. A plus is that a two year old and four year old are pretty far apart on coordination and playing skills but are more or less equals in it, aside from the 2 year old not being able to climb back in on his own. The weight limit is 240lbs which makes it for kids only and mom. Its definitely a toy that requires adult supervision but tossing balls back forth with the kids is fun for all of us, except our Lab who cant understand why she cant join in.

Unfortunately, only two of the three free apps work. The third one, how to count to 100, is nothing but a blank white screen. I can hear the sounds but my child and I cannot see anything and thus it's useless. Also, the format of the two apps that do work are lacking in entertainment value. Why not include music in the background? Why not offer rewards when kids get problems right? It could be as simple as an avatar or video game that opens or virtual stickers that they can use to decorate an online house. Almost every other educational game uses a behavioral reinforcement strategy to keep kids engaged. This doesn't. For this reason I am unsurprised that my kid stopped using this after two times.

12220,806,985,"I got the Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Smart Stages Mower for my one year old nephew. He was enthralled with it the second he saw it even before it was out of the package. It lights up, makes music, makes a revving sound, and can be pushed around to pretend mow or even to keep a slightly unstable toddler upright. It is not made to help a child walk though and shouldn't be used for that purpose.

The plastic is sort of thin and the edges are a little sharp. I don't think it will cause any harm but beware of that. It is very lightweight but looks like it can withstand an inquisitive child's handling. I think my nephew will continue to enjoy this mower as he matures and learns to use it in different ways. I removed a star because it is so lightweight and the edges are a little sharp. It would be better if the body were heavier and handles a bit more sturdy. Still, my nephew loves it.

There was a coupon on the page at the time I bought this so I got it for around $9.00. If my review comes up as unverified, that is why. But I did, indeed, purchase this mower from Amazon last month.",1522195200,4,got fisherpric laugh learn smart stage mower one year old nephew enthral second saw even packag light make music make rev sound push around pretend mow even keep slightli unstabl toddler upright made help child walk though shouldnt use purpos plastic sort thin edg littl sharp dont think caus harm bewar lightweight look like withstand inquisit child handl think nephew continu enjoy mower matur learn use differ way remov star lightweight edg littl sharp would better bodi heavier handl bit sturdi still nephew love coupon page time bought got around 900 review come unverifi inde purchas mower amazon last month

One of the problems with this particular Nerf gun is that it tends to jam.  The revolver part will get stuck if a foam dart sticks out slightly more than it should.  This also can bend/crease your darts.  It also leaves you vulnerable when in an all-out Nerf war with your family.
This received 4 stars, instead of 3, because it's more accurate (when it doesn't jam) than the Nerf Mega Gun Twin Shot.  It does only shoot one at a time as opposed to the Twin Shot (shoots 2-3 at a time), but it's by far more accurate.",1522195200,4,typic fun nerf product fyith mega size dart tend sting littl smaller counterpart one problem particular nerf gun tend jam revolv part get stuck foam dart stick slightli also bendcreas dart also leav vulner allout nerf war famili receiv 4 star instead 3 accur doesnt jam nerf mega gun twin shot shoot one time oppos twin shot shoot 23 time far accur

It's adorable, a cute smaller size. You wind up the flippers then put him in the water and he swims away. It's pretty much what I expected for the price. It says 9 month+ and I would say even a little older unless you are there to manually wind the flippers every time. Also, after a single use it has water in it so I don't know how long it's going to last before getting moldy inside. He does swim quite well. So, overall, a cute and fun little toy but there is room for improvement too.",1522195200,3,div idvideoblockrszq0sidqishv classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi91za5ejzn9smp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi812bblyaijxspng classvideoslateimgurlnbspi purchas toy fun littl bath toy almost 1yearold ador cute smaller size wind flipper put water swim away pretti much expect price say 9 month would say even littl older unless manual wind flipper everi time also singl use water dont know long go last get moldi insid swim quit well overal cute fun littl toy room improv

The side bit where you store the pegs also opens very easily, which means picking pegs up off the floor a lot. And its impossible to keep the code pegs and the smaller result pegs separate, they just get mixed up.

12298,2775,3039,"If you only get 1 Pandemic game I recommend this one. It's unique play style means you have to get a little creative with your turns. The optional migration and virus rules can really add to the challenges. However just to be clear you do NOT eradicate any of the diseases only create cures. This is also unique because it's a historical reference to a specific time and place. It feels more authentic than just regular world threats. You have to communicate with the other players and come up with plans not just the current turn but future turns. Example: there is no flying to a different area to cure something you can choose to travel by train or boat instead. However you have to build the railroad along the way. So if you wish to utilize the rail system (which I like way more and can almost seem over powered)  you and the others need to spend action to create them and that can at times be a tricky decision if you're also on the verge of Epidemic cards.

I loved it, my wife loves it, nieces (11 & 4)  and nephew(8) will only play this version and my friends will spend a good 30 minutes strategizing to get the best possible outcome. It's great for all ages.

CONS:
From the moment I first popped batteries into Marco, he has not turned off. Even without water, he is constantly on. Until the batteries die (about 1.5 weeks later).
This toy does not float. While he does always stand upright, he will sink to the bottom of the tub without fail every time. Sometimes, if we're lucky the very top of the white helmet will poke it's head above water.

PROS:
Beautiful vivid lights. This toy slowly rotates colors that will illuminate the bathwater. For best results, turn off the bathroom lights.
Sturdy, heavyweight toy.
High quality materials.

Overall, I don't regret buying this toy.

  There are 26 tiles in both vs 22 in regular Hive game (extra pieces mentioned above). I am including a size comparison so you can see size of pocket pieces vs regular pieces. I like them both. It might be easier to teach children to play with pocket, since bugs are colored. If you are considering the colored bug original version (22 piece) the buy the 3rd edition. That edition is this gorgeous bakelite material that this Pocket and Carbon sets are made of vs painted wood that can chip and be damaged and is not as nice nor weighty as the bakelite.
  The bugs are painted really well in this Pocket version. No skimping here. I am very impressed. Storage bag is really soft and nice hand feel to it. Don't think that matters? If you carry it around you will. It is a very pleasant feeling, I believe it is a short well done microfiber but I'm not sure. It doesn't feel suede like.

12621,2451,2183,"Great baby toy! I have this around the handle of our infant carrier. It wraps around there in seconds and is ready to go. There are a bunch of different toys to hold baby's attention. Each toy has colors and contrast to attract babies of all ages. All the toys are also nice and soft. No worries about anything heavy or solid smacking baby in the face. If you hang it down a bit the lion and monkey toys will be low enough for a teething baby to chew on.

This is super easy to remove, it only takes seconds. I can move it from the infant seat to the stroller in about 10 seconds. Very convenient. Everything is also washable, so when the toy gets a little soaked with spit and such you can just throw it in the washer. I washed mine in a laundry bag though to keep it separate from the rest of the load. I didn't want to risk anything getting stuck or ripped. I did not dry it, I just hung it up for a few hours and it was dry enough to put back on the carrier.

This makes a wonderful gift to any new parent as well. Anything that can buy you a few minutes with a baby is just priceless, LOL! This is my third kid, so trust me, you want a bunch of toys like this to rotate so baby doesn't get bored.

Problem 2: Then as I was cleaning up the side of the box fell off. If it was my son I would have probably blamed him being rough but it was me and a puzzle piece touched the side and it just fell off. I bought 2 sets and one is for a gift and I am wishing that it was free returns because I don't want to give them something that will fall apart and the return cost is almost as much as the product itself.

12767,3927,3161,"Definitely a fun, fast paced family game.  This is the perfect game to introduce to young children, family and friends that aren't serious gamers.  The laughter involved in hitting or flicking the penguins into walls, into each other, over walls into new rooms is so great.  I wish that it was a 6 player game so more people could play at once, however, it is a fast enough game people can come in and out of the game in a short time.

So I'm late to the Nerf party, I just started collecting and getting interested in the hobby. I've always loved lever action rifles and I wanted this blaster more than any other on the market! I was like a big child when I saw the box, super pumped!
However what I received was an extreme disappointment. Firstly it looked as though the box had been tampered with. Not only that, it was missing screws and the stock wasn't even attached and fell right off. I'm not a professional on Nerf, but I do read and do my research. The slingfire unmodified isn't very powerful to begin with, but what I received was even worse than the ""average"" fps for the blaster. It shot like a limp noodle, I've shot dollar store knockoffs with better performance.
This really crushed me, seeing as these are not widely available anymore and just to get one you have to pay 60-100 bucks.",1522627200,2,let prefac say review reflect think slingfir blaster receiv deliveri im late nerf parti start collect get interest hobbi ive alway love lever action rifl want blaster market like big child saw box super pump howev receiv extrem disappoint firstli look though box tamper miss screw stock wasnt even attach fell right im profession nerf read research slingfir unmodifi isnt power begin receiv even wors averag fp blaster shot like limp noodl ive shot dollar store knockoff better perform realli crush see wide avail anymor get one pay 60100 buck

Shoots very far! The only problem is it jams a lot, but the solution is you could push the dart in more with a metal wire. This makes the handle able to move again. Move the handle back and take out the magazine. Then push forward the handle and fire out the jammed dart or just open the jam door and take out the dart. One tip is Do not use other darts from other brands! My old rampage was destroyed by a air wars dart. One of the best things about this gun is little kids can use it! The sliding handle is very easy to slide.

I sat with him & we played with the water beads for almost an hour, transferring them into cups, scooping them with a little strainer, even bouncing them in an even bigger bowl. He was having so much fun! The beads held up extremely well to our play, maybe 4 out of the 80 or so broke.
I will say though- if you see a broken one, scoop it out, because even though the whole beads don't break easily, once one does break it pretty much falls apart. Still not a big deal, you'll just have tiny gel shreds in with the whole beads.
These beads are very cool, and I like that they are non toxic and not slimy at all. Age-wise, I'd say 4 & up would probably be fine playing on their own, but any younger should be supervised just to make sure the beads don't end up becoming a snack!

13068,4075,71,"Since Terraforming Mars came out it has been extremely popular in the board gaming community. I usually don't jump on on the bandwagon of the hottest new board games, but this game is an exception.

Pros -
The theme: It is a very refreshing unique theme that keeps you engaged  (who doesnt want to be apart of making Mars a great place to live).

Replayability: This game never plays exactly the same each time you play. Each game you end up playing different cards, plus you have a unique corporation that gives you an advantage in some way. There are also multiple paths to victory. I have played games where I won doing a specific strategy, but then other games I use the same strategy only to be beaten by someone with a completely different strategy.

Options: There are many options of what to do with your resources in order to get points, no matter how many resources you end up with there is always something you can do. Some options are clearly better than others (but the better ones cost more, so it balances out). This adds a lot of options to your strategy, you can go for the short game, or be in it for the endgame points.

Science: This isn't really all that important, but many of the science ideas on the cards are pretty accurate. As a science teacher, this is an added bonus to know that you can play board games and learn some real science!

Cons -
Materials: The player mats and cards are a little thin, but it isn't really a problem for gameplay. I just worry about the lifetime of the components. I actually laminated some player mats to make them more durable. Sleeving the cards could also help protect the cards. Also, the player mats have no way of holding the resource cubes in place so if you are not careful a little bump can mess up your player mat.

Rules: Although I think the gameplay is easy to follow once you understand the rules, getting to a full understanding can take a little time (partly because there are so many options). First time I taught this to a new group it took about 30 minutes to fully explain the rules. Make sure to give the rules a good read through before you bring the game to the table. It helped me to watch a few run-through videos online. The game does include some quick help cards which are very useful. This game is definitely best for teens or adults due to its complexity.

I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys medium to heavy euro style games and wants a new refreshing theme. Some people say the game can be too mean, but I don't think that is the case. Most of the mean actions are optional and only affect other players in minor ways. My wife dislikes any game that can be too confrontational, but she is always willing to play this game with me.",1522713600,5,sinc terraform mar came extrem popular board game commun usual dont jump bandwagon hottest new board game game except pro theme refresh uniqu theme keep engag doesnt want apart make mar great place live replay game never play exactli time play game end play differ card plu uniqu corpor give advantag way also multipl path victori play game specif strategi game use strategi beaten someon complet differ strategi option mani option resourc order get point matter mani resourc end alway someth option clearli better other better one cost balanc add lot option strategi go short game endgam point scienc isnt realli import mani scienc idea card pretti accur scienc teacher ad bonu know play board game learn real scienc con materi player mat card littl thin isnt realli problem gameplay worri lifetim compon actual lamin player mat make durabl sleev card could also help protect card also

The clay was so easy to dig through with the included tools, even to the point where you could just break the clay into pieces. The design on the clay was so pretty - looked like a big crystal. The gemstones are gorgeous - big, great variety, plentiful. It comes with a handbook too that shows the various gems and what they are used for. I would purchase this item again as a gift or even for a classroom project. I had my 5-year-old son do this in a big bowl and the mess wasn't too bad, but it's impossible not to get a little messy. The only drawback was that a little of the dust got in his eye, but if you wanted to prevent that then you could probably just wet the clay a little.

13175,4111,56,"This is such a nice breath of fresh air, because it seems like the majority of my daughter's toys require batteries and make lots of flashy and loud noises. My daughter first started playing with this at 9 months. At that time, she quickly picked up on the middle button which just requires a simple push for the panda bear to pop up.  I feel like it nicely introduced the meaning of cause and effect. She was quite pleased with her ability to get it to open up on her own.  She also enjoyed watching me pop up all of the animals so that she could ""close"" them all herself. Now at 13 months, she is learning how to maneuver some of the other buttons/switches.

My only complaint is that the fourth ""button"" that opens the lion seems to be quite hit or miss. Sometimes it takes half a turn to open, sometimes you have to go around and around about 10 times before the lion pops up. It can be a little frustrating, but my daughter seems to think it is funny.

The theme is exciting as you take the role of the Sheriff debating whether to let peoples goods pass by or as you try to trick the Sheriff into letting your bag of goods pass by without inspection. Seeing as the enjoyment of the game really increases as people get into their roles as a smuggler (trying to get high valued cards past the notorious Sheriff of Nottingham) or as the Sheriff (trying to prevent contraband from entering Nottingham), I could see how with a more serious group of people the game might not be as enjoyable. I really enjoy the fact that each game everyone gets a chance to take on each role (Sheriff and smuggler), it helps keep the game balanced and interesting.

Owning to the fact that there were quite a few of these trucks within the package, I gave some of them to my son to play with.  Overall, he likes them.  They wind up and zoom across the room, which is fun for him.

As far as I am concerned, there are only two negative aspects to these little trucks that warranted deducting a star.  First, they break easily; the dump truck lost its parts within days of playing with them (not roughly either).  Secondly, they don't zoom straight across the room; sometimes, they turn on their own, making it difficult for my son to track visually.

The theme is light but fun as you try to get sets of different types of sushi cards that have point values. The game is quick and easy to learn.  This is a great family game. My 4-year-old is able to play, he doesnt always understand what every card does, but he does understand that he wants to get the same type of cards (it isn't rare for him to win playing against adults).

If you are debating between this and the regular version Sushi Go, get this one. This game includes all the same cards that are included in Sushi Go, as well as many other cards that can be switched in/out. This really increases the replayability value of the game, as you have many combinations of cards to play with making every time you play a little bit different. Will all the cards you can also set up the game so it has a very different feel. You can make it a friendly game where every set of cards just gives you points for certain amounts (this is what I do with my 4-year-old), you can make it more cutthroat, or you can make it more of a race for certain sets of cards.

When the deck runs out you bid for the remaining auction cards with gold you picked up earlier. The person with each majority gets points for that color and most points wins. Throw in a few more rules but that is basically the game and it does not disappoint.

The surround backboard is made to fit any 18"" dartboard and is provides an addition 5"" radioius with 1"" thick high-density foam. This provides a good amount of additional coverage, which is exactly what I was looking for. I have had more darts his this and the wall then the dartboard itself at this point.

This is also great because it comes in four pieces you just fit together like a puzzle and put on the outside of your already installed dartboard - there are not tools or hardware needed! You are also able to reverse it to get some additional use out of it and you can turn it around so you do not see the viper logo.

My daughter got to the point that she wouldn't allow me to clean the floors because she HAD to be doing it herself. I immediately went online and purchased this cleaning set.

PROS:
Primarily made of wood. The dustpan/base are plastic. This is a huge plus considering plastic is so bad for our environment.
These aren't just toys. Each cleaning supply can actually clean. These are miniatures of the real deal.
The wood is smooth and there is no worry of slivers.
I haven't had any issues with the mop shedding as others have stated.
The actual toys are lightweight and easy for young toddlers to carry around themselves.

CONS:
The stand is a little tall for petite toddlers. My daughter cannot reach the top of the stand where the items hang from.
The items hang by little pieces of string. I imagine this is difficult for every toddler to remove. I wish there was a more toddler-friendly way to hang these.

13700,4250,71,"Terraforming Mars is an outstanding game. There is a ton of variety in this game and working to make the planet of Mars livable has never been so much fun. I have played two solo games, one 2 player and one 3 player game. The solo games were a lot of fun even without another person to interact with and the game played very well. In the single player variant you have to make the planet habitable before 14 generations (rounds) complete. Even though I technically lost because I didn't get the planet habitable until generation 15, I still had a ton of fun playing the game and it didn't really feel like a loss. Two player was also just as fun BUT 3 player is where its at in my opinion. With 3 players you actually feel like you are making a difference on the board.

As you complete tasks to make the planet livable which come from the 3 main operations (Oxygen, temperature, water) you lay tiles on the board in the form of water and greenery. There are also some other types of tiles that can be laid for example one of the cards you draw allows you to set off a nuke to increase the temp on the planet. This also has you lay a special tile down on the board that shows a mushroom cloud which I thought was pretty nifty. Besides all those there are also city tiles you can lay that increase your end game score.

Which leads to my next point, how you win. So to end the game you must get all three of the operations I mentioned above maxed out. Once this happens you get 1 more chance to convert your plants to greenery tiles and then you start calculating your score. This score is based on a number of things such as the cards you used throughout the game, how much your cities are worth, how many greenery tiles you laid and a special awards and milestones section on the board. To make it easy to track this there is a nice little point tracker that circles the outside border of the game board that you also have your tokens on so you know where you stand as the game progresses.

A single player game lasts around 45 minutes or so and each player that plays over that adds another hour to the game play. So for our three player game, it lasted around 3 hours. As far as the gameplay goes I really cannot think of anything I did not like about the game. It has a very large amount of different cards to draw from and there are quite a few corporations to play as starting out which will give the game a ton of replay ability.
So why the 4 stars? It pains me to even say it but the component quality of this game is by far the worst of any game I have ever played. If you have ever played a game called Scythe then you can see just how badly Terraforming Mars needs an upgrade. That said I actually prefer Terraforming Mars over Scythe gameplay wise, but Scythe blows Terraforming Mars off the planet production wise. And of course this gripe is purely subjective. If gameplay is what matters to you then get his game immediately! Just be warned top not expect anything fancy out of the box.

To name a few of the quality issues that Ive seen: The cards are very thin and you may want to sleeve them to keep them in pristine condition. The resource cubes are pretty and glossy but the paint has already started to chip away on some of them after 4 plays. And the worst contender of all..the player mats. Oh my the player mats need an upgrade something fierce. Honestly truth be told I would be totally fine with all the other issues but these player mats are a travesty. To give you an idea of how these work, you are expected to place your tiny little colored tokens on your player mat to keep track of each of your 6 different productions in the game. These range from 0 up to 10 or more. Now these player mats are the most flimsy paper mats I have ever laid eyes on. You could be in the middle of a game 2 hours in and someone gets up to get a drink and bumps the tableall your tokens shift. You look down with bewildered eyes having no idea where they all were. OR, (and this has actually happened to me during 1 of my 4 plays) When you are picking up more resource tokens to add to your supply, you accidentally drop one of the heavier 10 valued ones on your player mat. These mats are so light and flimsy that even a drop of a resource toke will cause your markers to shift.

Because of this I cannot give the game a full 5 stars even though the gameplay of the game certainly warrants a 5 star review. Now all that being said, the company Broken Token sells a nice game organizer (that you can also buy on Amazon) that includes a totally new player mat that is made of wood and has indentations to securely hold your markers. I have ordered that and will also be reviewing it soon.
Besides the complaints I have on component quality, this game is a must have and is very addicting.",1523145600,4,terraform mar outstand game ton varieti game work make planet mar livabl never much fun play two solo game one 2 player one 3 player game solo game lot fun even without anoth person interact game play well singl player variant make planet habit 14 gener round complet even though technic lost didnt get planet habit gener 15 still ton fun play game didnt realli feel like loss two player also fun 3 player opinion 3 player actual feel like make differ board complet task make planet livabl come 3 main oper oxygen temperatur water lay tile board form water greeneri also type tile laid exampl one card draw allow set nuke increas temp planet also lay special tile board show mushroom cloud thought pretti nifti besid also citi tile lay increas end game score lead next point win end game must get three oper mention max happen get 1 chanc convert plant greeneri tile start calcul

13702,4251,1875,"Edited:  I am leaving my original review because it is still valid, but I'm changing my rating because this is not what I thought I was buying.  This is not the original redhead made to move doll.  The skin tone is about three shades darker.  It's the same as the original blonde made to move doll.  I'm beyond angry.  If I had known Mattel changed the skin tone,  I would not have bought these.  I didn't want more of this skin tone.  I wanted the original skin tone.  As demonstration,  I added a photo of my original redhead made to move (#1)  versus the one I just bought (#2)  the difference is obvious.  I want my money back.

I love the made to move line.  I collect then almost exclusively.  It is a fantastic line of dolls with almost a limitless amount of poseability.  As a child,  I would have been nuts about this doll.  Perfect for the in between childhood and teenager times.  And for that,  they deserve 5 stars. They are still absolutely perfect for this,  and if I had bought them to give to a child they would have received five stars.

That being said,  I am pretty disappointed in the quality of the made to move dolls that Mattel has been producing of late.  Four out of six made to move dolls have been of subpar quality. The seam edges are getting worse and worse and I've started finding black marks in the skin and imperfections in the make up.  Please Mattel.  Please.  I love these dolls and will continue to buy them until they dissapear from the internet all together, but please go back to being strict about quality control.

13796,4279,1007,"My son just turned 6 and is going through a major Lego phase which is awesome (but expensive!!) and for his birthday we wanted to get him a bunch of misc bricks so he could be more creative than just assembling sets and add on to them but didn't want to spend a fortune, so I looked into these and decided they were worth a shot!  I'm so glad I did.  They are definitely compatible with the existing Legos we already have and come in a great variety and assortment of shapes, sizes and colors!  I was able to nearly fill one of these Lego brick containers with what comes in this box!  That's a lot of possibilities!  I also plan to get some generic car parts and windows and doors to complete the collection.  In addition to this set of 1,100 bricks I also bought 4 generic 10"" x 10"" base plates and a set of 20 generic mini figures.  In total I spent $50 on that stuff.  If I had bought authentic Lego for all of it, I would've easily spent $150.  I can confirm that all of it is compatible with genuine Lego stuff!

See my side by side comparison with a Lego brick in the same size and color as the Brickyard equivalent.  They are very hard to tell apart.  The only thing I would say I noticed (besides the word LEGO missing from each knob - and seriously, who cares about that?) is that the knobs (I don't know the technical name for them) of the brickyard bricks seem ever so slightly smaller in diameter than the Lego ones, such that a genuine Lego minifigure's feet don't stick to the generic knobs quite as firmly/securely as they do to the Lego brand bricks.  If I shake it, the generic piece starts to come loose from the foot of the Lego figure (see pic).  That being said, how often does your kid shake their Legos?  I think it fits well enough to work for our needs and CERTAINLY for the far cheaper price!!  I do wish they came with some of the single row long flat pieces, but that's just me being picky.  Truly, for the price I think these are a fantastic value and offer great compatibility with Lego brand stuff.

I'm happy to report that I am having much better luck with the new set...Whether or not I got a bad set, I'm unsure, but the new set is working much better. I had no problems with them in the Car, just during the charging process ( on 2 different brands of chargers). I would buy again, and the seller is an excellent representative of their product !!! They even wrote me a handwritten note along with the free replacements... Very Happy Now !!-------  Update Complete----I bought these (3pk) to adapt Floureon 2s LiPo to my Traxxas Slash 2wd. They fit the car fine, BUT...PAY attention to polarity (red-red + black-black), they will plug in either way on the Traxxas ends... I have a problem when using these adapters to charge the Floureon Batts on the Traxxas ID charger. I make sure polarity is correct, hook up the balance plug and...Nothing... I usually have to wiggle the larger charging plug a few times until the Traxxas charger 'recognizes' these adapters. Several times, the charger has stopped working, mid-charge, resulting a blinking red led on charger, and a half charged battery... If I wiggle battery connection, I can restart the charging process and it's usually fine. I have no problems charging these batteries on a different charger if I don't use these plugs. I think these are a good quality plug, and they always work in the car, but they just don't work well with the newer Traxxas ID charger, all 3 have been 'temperamental'.  Again , in the car they are great, as are the Floureon Batts, 2S Floureon LiPo 40c 6200 mah...but in the Traxxas basic charger, which most of us are stuck with, these need a little more than ' set and forget ' attention. They are well made and well packaged. Maybe I just got a bad set? Maybe my Traxxas charger is finicky? I don't know, but I have to use these for my particular situation, so I will deal with it.

The letters are well made and easy to wipe with a handle on each letter. The apps are super cute with their animations and sounds. They love Alphamonster and demand to play it every day. I love their repetition of sounds and improved letter and sound association.

We live in a rural area so he is able to drag this thing with him wherever he goes and so far it has held up to it.

So far it isn't even dented or bent, and this is with being left outside for nearly 6 months now (through the winter too).

Anyhow this toy is tough, and if your kid likes trucks like mine they will probably get a lot of use out of this toy.

Younger kids can simply match up the easily identified animals.  If they (or parents) have trouble, the background patterns can also helpthere is only one pattern design per three-card animal character.  We also use the cards like a memory gameturning the cards over and relying on recall to make a complete set.  No matter how we begin playing, the kids always end up creating their own zany looking animals.  No major rules or upsets and everyone stays happy.  We have two year old twins, so keeping peace counts for a lot, and there are enough cards (24) for them to share.

Im not sure why the recommended age range is 3+.  Perhaps it is because the 3"" x 4 1/2"" rectangular cards are made out of sturdy recycled material, but could eventually come apart if sucked on.

14212,3946,3336,"Grandson loves all things Rescue Bots so this add-on item was a hit as a side gift for Christmas to the Playskool Rescue Bot fire department play set. A nice feature of this little set is that the dog and other Rescue Bots that shot ""fake"" water can put of ""flames"" but shooting at them and knocking them down like a little shooting gallery.

* This is such a neat idea for youngsters. They see everyone talking on a cell phone. Even as young as they are they do want to do what we are doing.
* This touch and swipe phone is designed for entertainment, but, it also allows me  to keep my cell phone Safe.
* I got this for my granddaughter who is a little over one year old. I get to keep her, from 7 AM until 4 PM, while her mommy, My daughter, teaches school.
* We do lots of fun things together. However, when I get a call or a text she is  grabbing for the phone, because, it must be interesting if Im doing it.
* I was searching for a different toy when I saw this in the sidebar. I am mediately clicked on it and I knew she was going to love it. She really enjoys music and she enjoys interactive toys.
*  This phone allows her to expand her imagination, gather her independence, increase her coordination and attention span.
* Plus she has tons of fun.
* It has a slide button that alternate between two screens. The 12 picture apps or the music Screen where the buttons for play, pause, back, and forward actually work.
* There is an on/off switch on the very top of the phone, located in the position that my iPhone has the dim screen button.
* Yesterday, I told her Im turning off my phone now, see my button. And I think just said she turned hers off. I showed her how.
* The next time I did it. I said do you want to turn off your phone too, and she did.
* Theres lots the love in this telephone. The home button will record the home phone number so the child can begin to remember it.
* It helps with teaching, learning, ABCs and words. Its not just a toy. Its an adventure.

My only complaint is it doesn't protect them from the sun as much as I'd like, so yesterday when it was really hot, I put a blanket over the side of it and it blocked the sun from my 6 month old. You'll notice in the last picture that no sun is touching her. The first couple pictures is when we first got it a few weeks ago. My husband thought he could just blow it up with his mouth, but was quickly running to the store when he realized how long it would take, and would probably make him pass out. So you definitely need to buy an electric air pump! The sun shade stays on great every time. I read reviews that it would fly off, but we had a lot of wind yesterday and it held up well. We plan to use this for upcoming play dates and birthday parties. I posted some pictures of the kids playing in it, and we now have a play date planned to let the babies play in it with with a local mommy group I'm in.

The wand detaches, then she is left with the blue handle in her hand. The doll without the flying cat is more than this one. And that one cannot sit either, so even if this one breaks its okay.
The batteries aren't fun to put in and it takes four AAAs. To make it work, you have to hold down the button constantly on the back of the leg.
The cord can sometimes get tangled in the spinning propellers but it's fine to unravel.
Getting hit with a spinning propeller will not hurt you. At most, lightly sting.
This item is very loud like a mini weed whacker.

My own phone with 12 pretend apps and call button end end call button.  They say hello and goodbye.
* This is such a neat idea for youngsters. They see everyone talking on a cell phone. Even as young as they are they do want to do what we are doing.
* This touch and swipe phone is designed for entertainment, but, it also allows me  to keep my cell phone Safe.
* I got this for my granddaughter who is a little over one year old. I get to keep her, from 7 AM until 4 PM, while her mommy, My daughter, teaches school.
* We do lots of fun things together. However, when I get a call or a text she is  grabbing for the phone, because, it must be interesting if Im doing it.
* I was searching for a different toy when I saw this in the sidebar. I am mediately clicked on it and I knew she was going to love it. She really enjoys music and she enjoys interactive toys.
*  This phone allows her to expand her imagination, gather her independence, increase her coordination and attention span.
* Plus she has tons of fun.
* It has a slide button that alternate between two screens. The 12 picture apps or the music Screen where the buttons for play, pause, back, and forward actually work.
* There is an on/off switch on the very top of the phone, located in the position that my iPhone has the dim screen button.
* Yesterday, I told her Im turning off my phone now, see my button. And I think just said she turned hers off. I showed her how.
* The next time I did it. I said do you want to turn off your phone too, and she did.
* Theres lots the love in this telephone. The home button will record the home phone number so the child can begin to remember it.
* It helps with teaching, learning, ABCs and words. Its not just a toy. Its an adventure.
* Hope this info helps.

- I love that the baby animal in each puzzle is one separate piece, then the other puzzle pieces go around it - that makes it a bit easy for your puzzle-learner to navigate if you start with the baby animal.

CONS:
- they are essentially just thick cardboard pieces - my younger toddler of course instantly put them in her mouth, and the edges swelled and got ruined.

14462,1332,753,"I bought this for my four-year-old nephew to help him learn his letters. Unfortunately his home environment doesn't really encourage it. There are two modes: one where the whole letter shows up on the screen and you can trace the whole thing at once, and another that does it step-by-step: the screen will show you where to start and where to stop, and it'll have a dotted line in between that appears as you follow it. You complete one section of the letter (like going down the length of an upper-case T) before you can go on to the next (crossing the upper-case T). This step-by-step mode is very frustrating for my nephew. It may be the kid (he's a very impatient child), or it could be the toy. I don't know. If you don't follow the line rather precisely, it makes you start over. If you lift up the pen while following the line, it makes you start over. I can certainly understand why it's frustrating for him. He does better when he can trace the whole thing at once. The problem with that mode is that you don't have to follow the lines to get the ""correct"" sound. You can scribble all over it, and it'll still tell you it's correct, so I don't really think that helps with the learning, either.

I don't like using electronics to teach children - with my own son (who's not even a year old yet), we don't encourage electronics, TV, etc. I prefer the old-fashioned toys like stacking rings, blocks, books, etc. But I bought this for my nephew because he's usually playing by himself, and he -- like most kids -- is intrigued by electronics. I had hoped that this would keep his interest and help him learn. I haven't seen him playing with this in months, so I'm assuming he doesn't use it much.",1523577600,3,bought fouryearold nephew help learn letter unfortun home environ doesnt realli encourag two mode one whole letter show screen trace whole thing anoth stepbystep screen show start stop itll dot line appear follow complet one section letter like go length uppercas go next cross uppercas stepbystep mode frustrat nephew may kid he impati child could toy dont know dont follow line rather precis make start lift pen follow line make start certainli understand frustrat better trace whole thing problem mode dont follow line get correct sound scribbl itll still tell correct dont realli think help learn either dont like use electron teach child son who even year old yet dont encourag electron tv etc prefer oldfashion toy like stack ring block book etc bought nephew he usual play like kid intrigu electron hope would keep interest help learn havent seen play

At first, he'd just take off the rings one by one and toss them over his shoulder, then move on to another toy. Soon, after watching me put the rings back on the stand after he'd take them all off, he began trying to put them back on himself. The larger rings were easier at first because he could grip them with his fingers in the hole and still be able to fit them over the stand. He had more trouble with the smaller ones, because his fingers would get in the way. But before long, he had it mastered! He doesn't understand the order in which they should go on the stand yet, but he has no trouble at all putting any of them onto it. Now he'll fill up the stand, then hand it to me, and I'll take them off, and he'll put them back on again. We'll do this several times before he goes onto another activity. He loves it! It's great for motor skill development. It's such a simple little toy, but he absolutely loves it.

14808,4544,160,"Its tempting to say you cant beat the original, but as much as I love my authentic LEGO brand plate I must admit that a popular competitor that sells here on Amazon makes an even better 10x10 baseplate than the folks at LEGO themselves. But this is a close second and, as someone who has tried way too many generic brands for LEGOs via Amazon, I can tell you most of them are the same eh quality, LEGO still does it better than most, theres just one brand on here that has become so innovative that they're LEGO products are even better in every way, including of course cheaper, than the real deal. But that doesnt change the fact that this LEGO baseplate is good. Not sure how much else can be said about a baseplate, its ohciously compatible with LEGOs since it is a genuine LEGO product, perhaps of note is that its also proven compatible with all the different generic LEGOs I have as well... and that this shade of green is brighter than any green plates the Amazon knockoff competitors sell, so don't buy one of these and then a green plate from a competitor expecting them to match in color for something like a LEGO table.

Overall, LEGO started it all and theres a lot to appreciate in having an authentic baseplate, especially now that theyve come to their senses and started making the prices a lot more reasonable  $6 for a single plate makes it almost as cheap as the competitors but you have to buy theres in packs, usually at least 4. Im glad we have this piece in our LEGO collection. But its just a bit of a sad day when its not the best quality option out there, and a knockoff competitor is able to sell a product thats much sturdier, stacks multiples plates together with ease, has several unique features LEGO has yet to even come up with and all at a price less than LEGO charges.",1523836800,4,tempt say cant beat origin much love authent lego brand plate must admit popular competitor sell amazon make even better 10x10 basepl folk lego close second someon tri way mani gener brand lego via amazon tell eh qualiti lego still better there one brand becom innov theyr lego product even better everi way includ cours cheaper real deal doesnt chang fact lego basepl good sure much el said basepl ohcious compat lego sinc genuin lego product perhap note also proven compat differ gener lego well shade green brighter green plate amazon knockoff competitor sell dont buy one green plate competitor expect match color someth like lego tabl overal lego start there lot appreci authent basepl especi theyv come sen start make price lot reason 6 singl plate make almost cheap competitor buy there pack usual least 4 im glad piec lego collect bit sad day best qualiti option knockoff competitor

14823,619,3881,"Marbotic takes todays youths passion for tablets and integrates it with interactive activities so parents feel like their children are learning something. And indeed they will, but it may take awhile before your child is able to complete the tasks on their own.

You receive twenty-six wooden letters of the alphabet in this set. Children use fine motor skills picking up the capital letters, will see a variety of colors, and will have to learn how to place the padded underside into the screen. Before they can do that, however, adults must download the apps and select from one of eight languages, which includes a differentiation between British and American English. This could be a good way to not only serve children around the world, but possibly introduce them to other languages as well. Completing setup of the apps might require Wi-Fi. The three different apps focus on different language concepts - alphabet, vocabulary, and spelling.

The alphabet app has a robot-type character that makes various noises while encouraging children to match letters to silhouettes, sounds, or pictures (place the R in the monster for robot, Q for quill, etc.)

The vocabulary app has pictures swim across the screen while children need to find the first letter for each object and touch it, then the app names that object - alligator, guard (not soldier), gazelle, etc., and then that object disappears. Sometimes there will be multiples of the same object, and they may overlap. Children may need help with some objects, and sometimes they're too smart for their own good (just fish, not pufferfish).

The writing words app is much more free-form.  Children place the letters on the screen and they appear, staying on screen until moved to the trash can. Users can change the font size to accommodate more letters or see them better, and move them around to create multiple words with the same letters (sat, at, cat, cats, tac, tacs, etc.).  The letters can be touched to say their sounds, which sometimes sound odd to what we normally hear, but have to be lined up just right to form the word, then that whole word is read.

My kindergartner thinks these apps are cute because they make funny sounds. It helps her learn to sound out words better, and she enjoys finding the letters to use. The letters come in three stacking trays, but a part of me wishes there was a storage bag for them.  The box does have a magnetic flap, so they're fine for now, its just bulkier than it needs to be.

For the first few plays with each app an adult will need to be present to help, especially for younger children, and close by and available for when children get stuck on objects theyve never seen before. Overall, though, a good way to edu-tain children for awhile.",1523836800,5,marbot take today youth passion tablet integr interact activ parent feel like child learn someth inde may take awhil child abl complet task receiv twentysix wooden letter alphabet set child use fine motor skill pick capit letter see varieti color learn place pad undersid screen howev adult must download app select one eight languag includ differenti british american english could good way serv child around world possibl introduc languag well complet setup app might requir wifi three differ app focu differ languag concept alphabet vocabulari spell alphabet app robottyp charact make variou nois encourag child match letter silhouett sound pictur place r monster robot q quill etc vocabulari app pictur swim across screen child need find first letter object touch app name object allig guard soldier gazel etc object disappear sometim multipl object may overlap child may need help object sometim theyr smart good fish pufferfish write word app much freeform child place letter screen appear stay screen move trash user chang font size accommod letter

So far, none have gotten soggy after getting drool on them. But I guarantee they would eventually with enough sucking, chewing, drooling, etc. Luckily the cards are made large enough that if you left them out on the floor a baby would have a difficult time choking on these.

Cons: Our 3 year old is not really into this game unfortunately. I've tried several times to play a matching game or a memory game with him. All he wants to do is dump these into a bowl of water to ""see them swim"". The fishes mouths are also quite small and not obvious that they are smiling/frowning. I tried to point this out to him, but he didn't really notice if you flip the fishes over they might be frowning or smiling.

Overall: A miss with our three year old. High quality stock cardboard and patterns are beautiful, shiny, sparkly and pleasing to the senses.

It was! He spent more time staring at the pieces trying to figure it out. It wasn't too hard that he became frustrated, but not so easy that he would solve it in one go.  Even though the pieces are quite large I even found this puzzle to be slightly challenging when I tried it. The scene has several train cars and tracks that look similar which forces you to try out several pieces before finding the match. Also, I liked that the size of the pieces makes them harder to lose and safer for his one year old sister toddling around eating everything she sees.

Overall: Beautiful puzzle with large, hard to lose pieces. Just the right difficulty level for this age group.

15182,249,3985,"This is a cute idea. . . but.  . . I have one main issue with this product.  Thats the packaging.  These cards come in a triangular box which is 9.5 tall X 5.5 across.  Though its kind of fun packaging. .  .its highly impractical.  There are two decks of cards inside.  There is extra cardboard holding it in.  Instead of using glue to seal all of the edges, there are tongue-in-slots. . . and they don't stay together.  So the company had to put round pieces of tape across, which looks bad.  Theres also no way to keep the cards neatly inside.  It would have been MUCH better to have a simple square box.

15323,2802,3973,"Outer space looks like a fun place in this colorful puzzle by Petit Collage. Two cheerful-looking astronauts wave from the surface of the moon, with the lunar lander behind them, as their rocket ship orbits overhead. Its a detailed image that also depicts the sun, the eight planets in the solar system, an asteroid, a galaxy and the international space station all set within 24 pieces in a 1.5 x 2-foot frame.  The puzzle has a child-friendly vibe of bold colors, charming illustrations and a tactile surface. The pieces are huge and sturdy, perfect for little hands that are still developing fine-motor skills. Most pieces feature parts of at least two images to visually guide assembly (this age isn't going to look at fitting shapes as much as fitting color patterns.). The best parts of this puzzle, though, are the shiny, bas relief foil highlights throughout (the astronaut suits, rings on Saturn, stars and ships)  the shiny objects definitely kept our 2 and 5-year-old builders engaged.

The 24 pieces add up to a large canvas that may almost be as big as your little puzzlers. That scale is another smart design of this puzzle. Kids in this age range love big projects. This space adventure also comes packed in a handy square box with a tabbed enclosure and a rope handle making it easy to store and transport. Your kids will love it. Also consider this puzzle  and others like it in the Petit line  as gifts for the young space invaders in your life.",1524182400,5,outer space look like fun place color puzzl petit collag two cheerfullook astronaut wave surfac moon lunar lander behind rocket ship orbit overhead detail imag also depict sun eight planet solar system asteroid galaxi intern space station set within 24 piec 15 x 2foot frame puzzl childfriendli vibe bold color charm illustr tactil surfac piec huge sturdi perfect littl hand still develop finemotor skill piec featur part least two imag visual guid assembl age isnt go look fit shape much fit color pattern best part puzzl though shini ba relief foil highlight throughout astronaut suit ring saturn star ship shini object definit kept 2 5yearold builder engag 24 piec add larg canva may almost big littl puzzler scale anoth smart design puzzl kid age rang love big project space adventur also come pack handi squar box tab enclosur rope handl make easi store transport kid love also consid puzzl other like petit line gift young space invad life

15416,774,3263,"The idea of this float is great, but it has some major flaws. First I'll start with the positives. The design is really cute with the octopus, crabs, and fish that are very bright and colorful for the baby to look at as they are floating in the pool. It would be nice to have an attached water toy on it as some other floats do, but it doesn't have one. The float materials seem to be sturdy and well made and I really like that you can adjust the seat strap underneath to make it most comfortable for your baby. It's also very lightweight and I like that you don't have to blow it up with your mouth which can put a hurting on your lungs and take forever or with a pump which exhausts the arms. It's also great that you can deflate it by opening the valve and putting your body weight on it to force the air out then closing the valve - this makes storage very convenient and requires less space.

Now the flaws: The zip on canopy is a great idea, however the canopy on this is pretty flimsy even when attaching the straps through the loops to hold it upright. Even with the straps as tight as they will go, the canopy still has a lot of slack, meaning that on a sunny day, it may not totally shield the baby from the sun and a strong wind could surely make the canopy performance even worse. The biggest flaw for me is the ""self inflating"" claim. When I first got it, I followed all instructions and opened the valve all the way to let it inflate. The instructions state the first time you inflate it will take longer than the usual 60 seconds. Well, after 24 hours of the valve being all the way open, it was still flat as a pancake and nowhere near as thick as the picture. I left it open for a few days and then it finally inflated itself over that time. I deflated it again and wanted to see if it took as long the second time and it still took at least 24 hours to reinflate, nowhere near the 60 seconds it claims on the directions. My advice? If you need the float on a certain day, make sure you inflate it several days beforehand. Overall it's a nice float, but the self inflating aspect really needs some work as does the canopy.",1524268800,3,idea float great major flaw first ill start posit design realli cute octopu crab fish bright color babi look float pool would nice attach water toy float doesnt one float materi seem sturdi well made realli like adjust seat strap underneath make comfort babi also lightweight like dont blow mouth put hurt lung take forev pump exhaust arm also great deflat open valv put bodi weight forc air close valv make storag conveni requir le space flaw zip canopi great idea howev canopi pretti flimsi even attach strap loop hold upright even strap tight go canopi still lot slack mean sunni day may total shield babi sun strong wind could sure make canopi perform even wors biggest flaw self inflat claim first got follow instruct open valv way let inflat instruct state first time inflat take longer usual 60 second well

This has the same Feel as regular Pandemic with the board and game play...with some variations such as No Flying trains instead, this makes a huge difference when outbreaks start Exploding!

The game board is beautiful, the cards, and at first I was disappointed by the wooden cubes but then realized Come on they've thought if everything, plastic didn't exist at that time!!
Honestly it took us 10 times to actually win, but the frustration just throws fuel on the fire....I can't stop playing it :-p

This is a must buy for any pandemic lover...you'll love the game play as he mesmerized by the board....

It's easy to learn usually we read the rules once and only had to check once to find out if we were allowed to do something. One of the characteristics of most games is that once someone is obviously ahead they are obviously the winner. That's not necessarily true with this game I had had two come from behind victories where someone had managed to buy certain cards, line up a good configuration of points and/or purchase a valuable spirit card. I liked that in a game that even when you think you know who the winner is you can be surprised by a come from behind.

The only thing I disliked was that you can draw decks on other players turns, I found that if my group got distracted for a period of time we forgot whose turn it was at the time of interruption. Had to implement a house rule that you can only draw on your turn. This isn't usually a problem my group has so it could be we were just easily distracted that day. I found that either way it didn't matter to the game when our cards were out.

This is a game I recommed for any household it's fun, unique, easy and you never play the same game twice.

Our favorite feature is the bulldozer transforms into an airplane!  So easy and so much fun!  Our 4 year old and 6 year old have no trouble making the bulldozer transform. Our youngest, age 2, loves to play with it but doesn't understand how to transform it.  All he does is asks one of his brothers to help.  Rubble is the perfect size to fit in the vehicle, whether it is a bulldozer or a plane.

15637,2558,3712,"Very clever product, but slight flaw.
The app picks up on the number and arrangement of the multiple points under the number in order to determine which number piece was placed on the screen.
That works well if the pieces are placed onto the squared & true so all points contact at relatively the same time.
Unfortunately, young children, with their limited fine motor skills, often place the piece onto the tablet slightly askew.
Some points contact before the other and the app misreads it as another number initially, then reads the correct number when all points make contact.
This is a difficult phenomenon to explain without putting the pieces in your hand.

Bottom line, the app relies on a level of fine motor skills that not all children in the intended age group can deliver.
As a consequence, the app reads out the wrong number periodically.
Even though it reads the correct number soon thereafter, that initial wrong number can be distracting.
A seemingly easy fix would be to delay reading to give the user more time to square the piece.
However, if the delay is too long, the response and the action become dissociated and can be equally distracting.

This is a difficult conundrum for the developer and they'll need to fine tune this as they go.
Possibly, they could increase the delay only for the numbers that give the most frequent misreading.
Or redesign the pieces a bit so the contacts don't resemble one another as much.

But once perfected, the possibilities are endless and could be a great tool for the classroom.
Kudos to a great product; best of luck in development.",1524441600,4,clever product slight flaw app pick number arrang multipl point number order determin number piec place screen work well piec place onto squar true point contact rel time unfortun young child limit fine motor skill often place piec onto tablet slightli askew point contact app misread anoth number initi read correct number point make contact difficult phenomenon explain without put piec hand bottom line app reli level fine motor skill child intend age group deliv consequ app read wrong number period even though read correct number soon thereaft initi wrong number distract seemingli easi fix would delay read give user time squar piec howev delay long respons action becom dissoci equal distract difficult conundrum develop theyll need fine tune go possibl could increas delay number give frequent misread redesign piec bit contact dont resembl one anoth much perfect possibl endless could great tool classroom kudo great product best luck develop

  POSITIVES
it is cool tot he touch.  Nice swirly colors when you start out playing with them.  Feels solid but moves like a liquid.  Feels cold and wet.  The swirl multi colors are great when you first see the bottles.  the bottles themselves look great also.  No odor or smell.  While wet comes out of hair quickly and easily (yes, this does happen but do not let it dry in the child's hair or it maybe problematic).  Did not stick to clothes.  Comes with three packs/bottles of slime.  Reusable.
  NEGATIVES
After the first time the children played with them the colors all seemed the nearly the same of some silvery shade, so really no long term difference.
Very hard to get back into the little bottles after play.

16050,3202,4178,"I was excited to find this on sale, and thought I would purchase it, for my niece, to put away for next Christmas. I tired to use the wand, which controls the dog, when I first got it, since there was a feature on the box that said ""try me"", and you could push it through a hole, without having to open the box. However, the wand did not work, so I ended up having to open the box anyway, and then had to work to get the clear rubber band off of the wand, and had to try to slide it out, without messing anything up. After getting it out, it still didn't work. I knew, after reading other reviews, before buying, to open it up and look at the batteries. Sure enough, the batteries were corroded inside. I replaced the batteries, and was able to get the wand to work, but was not able to use it to see if the dog worked (that's how you control the dog), without breaking apart the box. Also, I realized the dog also needs batteries, and was unsure if those might be corroded too, and since I could not open the dog, to find out, I didn't want to take a risk, on storing the dog until Christmas. So, I ended up sending it back. Too, bad, it is a cute item, but I am obviously not, (based on the reviews), the first one with this problem.",1524700800,3,excit find sale thought would purchas niec put away next christma tire use wand control dog first got sinc featur box said tri could push hole without open box howev wand work end open box anyway work get clear rubber band wand tri slide without mess anyth get still didnt work knew read review buy open look batteri sure enough batteri corrod insid replac batteri abl get wand work abl use see dog work that control dog without break apart box also realiz dog also need batteri unsur might corrod sinc could open dog find didnt want take risk store dog christma end send back bad cute item obvious base review first one problem

16053,23,3993,"My daughter (4) likes playing this game. To play, players take turns drawing three cards from a stack--one red, one yellow, one blue. Put together, the cards will tell you an action, like ""Skip around the trick-a-ma-stick while holding the ball in your right hand."" If you think you can perform that action, you say, ""I can do that!"" If not, you pass. There are quite a few ""stop"" cards. If you draw one of those, your turn is over and you can keep the stop cards in your pile, but the others go back in the pool. Once all the cards have been used up, the winner is determined to be whoever has the most cards

As some reviewers have said, the ""trick-a-ma-stick"" is a bit wobbly and doesn't stay up as well as it could. We haven't found this to be a huge problem though. Also, as others have said, the cards included with it provide a limited range of things to do--skip, walk backwards, crawl under, etc, usually while holding one of the foam shapes somehow (under your arm, on your belly, etc.) None of this bothers my daughter. She asks to play this game often and usually plays a couple of ""rounds"" before getting bored. It would be great if there were an expansion pack with more things to do!

In addition to providing exercise, this toy offers a good way to learn basic colors, numbers, and to practice reading the simple instructions.",1524700800,4,daughter 4 like play game play player take turn draw three card stackon red one yellow one blue put togeth card tell action like skip around trickamastick hold ball right hand think perform action say pas quit stop card draw one turn keep stop card pile other go back pool card use winner determin whoever card review said trickamastick bit wobbl doesnt stay well could havent found huge problem though also other said card includ provid limit rang thing doskip walk backward crawl etc usual hold one foam shape somehow arm belli etc none bother daughter ask play game often usual play coupl round get bore would great expans pack thing addit provid exercis toy offer good way learn basic color number practic read simpl instruct
16054,2451,4179,"I am testing this with my 2.5 year old. She was interested in it right away and climbed right on. This scooter rolls really nicely. We took it to the park and she was going around the trails easily. They are paved trails for walking, bikes, running, etc. They are not super smooth though, more like the road surface. She got hung up on breaks in the pavement and any spots that had a good amount of debris. (Think leaves, small stones, dirt, etc.) The only real issue I have with this is the size. It says it is for kids up to 3 years old, and we are on the upper end but not there yet and it is already small for her. I am going to post a picture of her on this for reference. She has been in the 25 percentile most of her life for height and weight, so it's not like she is just super big for her age. The handlebar should adjust up a little bit and it would be perfect.

Overall, this is sturdy but still light-weight. It fits in a tiny amount of space in my car so we just keep it there in case we get a chance to go to the park and play durng the day. Everything folds out from the bottom and is really easy to do. It has directions on the bottom to remind you how it all folds or unfolds. I have not had an issue yet. The back wheels can be a pain to hold the button in and then slide the sleeve back, but as long as I have two hands free to do it I can. It is easy to carry even when wrangling two preschoolers in a busy park.

We really liked this, but wish it was a bit taller in the handlebar. My daughter will outgrow this in a matter of months and never make it to 3 years like it says. I would still recommend it because she still enjoys it and has a ton of fun pushing herself along. It is great exercise for young kids, and a great way to burn up some of that extreme energy they have!",1524700800,4,test 25 year old interest right away climb right scooter roll realli nice took park go around trail easili pave trail walk bike run etc super smooth though like road surfac got hung break pavement spot good amount debri think leav small stone dirt etc real issu size say kid 3 year old upper end yet alreadi small go post pictur refer 25 percentil life height weight like super big age handlebar adjust littl bit would perfect overal sturdi still lightweight fit tini amount space car keep case get chanc go park play durng day everyth fold bottom realli easi direct bottom remind fold unfold issu yet back wheel pain hold button slide sleev back long two hand free easi carri even wrangl two preschool busi park realli like

16088,2131,1203,"The  Munchkin Scuba Swimming Bath Toy has been a fun addition to my daughter's bath and water play toy collection.

This toy is designed to swim across the surface of the water when you pull the headlamp string that is attached to the top part of the toy. It does this fairly well. You pull and the flippers are activated moving up and down sending the toy in a pretty straight line across the tub.

We haven't had this toy get gunky or gross. After play we typically turn it upside down so water can drip out of it. If you want to keep it very clean, you can take the screws out and clean it from the inside out. We did come across an issue with this toy. Basically, after my older children played with it, the string hung loose and wouldn't wind back up. But when my husband took it apart he was able to get the string to wind back up on the winding mechanism and the toy worked properly again. Despite the fact that the string can stop winding back up if tugged and pulled out too hard,  it's a simple enough fix so as to not trash the toy, to begin with. This retraction issue shouldn't happen if children are careful not to tug too harshly. I never had this issue happen when my toddler played with it in the tub just when my older kids played with it.

Over few weeks the toy did get few scratches making it looking worn out sooner than expected, however, this was with almost everyday play. I wouldn't suggest taking it out to a spray park or pool because I feel it would break hitting a hard surface floor.

Overall, this isn't overly priced for what it is and has provided lots of fun for youngest during bath time.",1524700800,3,munchkin scuba swim bath toy fun addit daughter bath water play toy collect toy design swim across surfac water pull headlamp string attach top part toy fairli well pull flipper activ move send toy pretti straight line across tub havent toy get gunki gross play typic turn upsid water drip want keep clean take screw clean insid come across issu toy basic older child play string hung loo wouldnt wind back husband took apart abl get string wind back wind mechan toy work properli despit fact string stop wind back tug pull hard simpl enough fix trash toy begin retract issu shouldnt happen child care tug harshli never issu happen toddler play tub older kid play week toy get scratch make look worn sooner expect howev almost everyday play wouldnt suggest take spray park pool feel would break hit hard surfac floor overal isnt overli price

My favorite thing is that all the pieces swing out or up or open to make it bigger, but then it also closes up compact for store. These are the BEST toys!

Ournson has fun playing with it, it's sturdy and solid and has nice colorful pieces.

The only thing I'll point out is that our son is in a bit of a ""destruction"" phase and with so many moving pieces he's constantly breaking pieces off. The good news is we've been able to put everything back together again and it's STILL holding up well despite that.

16181,4863,4175,"It appears the main beef with this game is that it is NOT TRIVIA with questions, answers or anything in that vein. Perhaps the game should have been called Movie Obsession or something that does not imply that it will be a trivia game.

That said, it's an interesting game that some will enjoy. If you like things like six degrees of Kevin Bacon than this may be the game for you. As a home with a teenager obsessed with movies and a father who has collected every movie ever made almost (started with VHS people, moved to DVDs) I have a few people that really like this game - I personally find it to be too much work and I don't want to have to work so hard to play a game. What I have witnessed however is them having a grand time trying to outwit each other and basically bonding over their cinema passion. That's pretty cool and is what earned this game 3 stars from me.

The packaging is pretty darn cool - which is another reason buyers seem pretty bent. Such cool packaging can't make up for expectations not met. Also, some of the directions are confusing. The edit card does two things - it acts as a missing trivia card but you still need to be connected to the previous take. Um- what? Anyhow - again, if you have a few movies your entire family or friends love you can connect at a table over this game, but it's not amazing or great or anything that I would tell people they need to have in their game collection.",1524787200,3,appear main beef game trivia question answer anyth vein perhap game call movi ob someth impli trivia game said interest game enjoy like thing like six degre kevin bacon may game home teenag ob movi father collect everi movi ever made almost start vh peopl move dvd peopl realli like game person find much work dont want work hard play game wit howev grand time tri outwit basic bond cinema passion that pretti cool earn game 3 star packag pretti darn cool anoth reason buyer seem pretti bent cool packag cant make expect met also direct confus edit card two thing act miss trivia card still need connect previou take um anyhow movi entir famili friend love connect tabl game amaz great anyth would tell peopl need game collect

16253,4662,4191,"I had never heard of this game prior to getting this review copy.  We are big fans of trick taking games like Fox in the Forrest and Diamonds.  We were very interested in trying a trick taking game with a board.  One thing I would suggest they do is make an instruction book that is more clear to follow or get Watch it Played to put out a tutorial video.  The instruction book left something to be desired and luckily we were able to piece together some things from the few short reviews out there and the one video we found of someone doing a demo of the game.  Once we did that, the instructions made more sense.  The game has a really neat take on trick taking especially with the Black Hat card.  That card really gives the game a unique twist and changes things up quite a bit from most trick taking games.  We also liked how the numbers were the suits and you can use tricks with multiple cards of the same number.  But again, the use of the Black Hat card where the minimum or lowest wins the trick is very unique.  We also like that the game has quite a bit that you can use to really increase the replayability.  The additional game board titles and the use of the 'tracer' can change up the game quite a bit from game to game.  I really suggest watching videos on line before playing and rereading the directions after watching.  It takes a few rounds, but once you get going, the game makes way more sense.  My only real critique is that the card quality is not that great.  Is it a better trick taking game than Diamonds or Fox and the Forrest, no it is not.  Diamonds is still the best trick taking game out there, and Fox is the best two player trick taking game.  However, this game has enough unique twists on the theme to get it to the table, but it won't be replacing Diamonds.  It has an interesting theme but once you start playing the theme does not really have much impact.  The game is certainly original and kudos to the creators for attempting to change things up a bit.",1524873600,4,never heard game prior get review copi big fan trick take game like fox forrest diamond interest tri trick take game board one thing would suggest make instruct book clear follow get watch play put tutori video instruct book left someth desir luckili abl piec togeth thing short review one video found someon demo game instruct made sen game realli neat take trick take especi black hat card card realli give game uniqu twist chang thing quit bit trick take game also like number suit use trick multipl card number use black hat card minimum lowest win trick uniqu also like game quit bit use realli increas replay addit game board titl use tracer chang game quit bit game game realli suggest watch video line play reread direct watch take round get go game make way sen real critiqu card qualiti great better trick take game diamond fox forrest

16271,4881,1389,"I bought this and was a little skeptical due to some of the reviews about the zipper breaking, but decided Id buy it anyways. When I first took it out of the box it looked great. Good condition, sturdy, and looks exactly like the pictures. My son just LOVES this little couch. He likes to take it into every room I go to. If Im folding laundry in the bedroom hell bring it with him. He also likes to unfold it and make it into a little slide and slides down it from the couch onto his trampoline. He gets creative with the different ways he can use it! As for the zipper, I had no major problems. You will need a paper clip to open the zipper as it has a safety feature on it to prevent kids from opening the zipper, which I really like. This means only I can open it, and hopefully means that the product will last longer since it won't be broken by my son. I was pretty careful while opening and closing the zipper because I was afraid to break it, so I suggest just opening and closing it slowly. It did get caught on the fabric a couple times but as long as you gently remove the fabric thats caught in the zipper youll be fine. Just don't be rough with it. The fabric is good quality. It held up very nicely in the washer. I was afraid it was going to shrink but I dried it on high heat and washed it in warm water and it didn't shrink at all. All the foam parts fit back in perfectly. When you take out the foam parts to wash it, just pay attention to how they were facing when you took them out. It took me 3 tries to get the foam back in properly, but I did get it!! Overall, I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it to friends and family. For 35$ I definitely think its worth it. I should also add that my son just turned 2 but is big for his age. Hes tall, in the 90th percent for height. Just to give you an idea of how big he is in the photos.

Edit: its been 3 months since I bought this. Its still a great product. My only complaint is that the foam has begun shifting around inside. Ive had to open it back up and fix it a couple times. But its not a huge deal. Son still loves this couch! I even use it as a pillow when I lay on the floor to play with my son.

We've had toys that were absolutely fabulous and toys that just didn't quite make a lasting (or good) impression. This falls somewhere in the middle.

The mermaid is cute. I'll give it that. It does swim pretty well (albeit slowly and doesn't make it across the tub all the way). With that being said, it's not the most impressive bath toy I've seen. It's a basic make the flipper go and watch it swim across the tub. It's cute but the paint is already getting scratched up on it. It's also somewhat of a pain to keep clean. You pretty much have to take the thing apart to make sure you keep it cleaned properly and be sure to hang it upside down so it can dry properly when not in use.

16363,2451,3985,"I really thought this was going to be more useful. The description says to take it with you and keeps calling this a puzzle. I wouldn't call this a puzzle, just more of a mix and match set. There are three cards that make up each character. That's it. There are no stories with this or games or anything. Just the pieces. I tested this with my 2.5 year old and my 5 year old. Neither was interested for more than a few minutes and now it just sits on the table for days and nobody wants it. The cards are just a little bit too big to take with you anywhere because you need so much space to make a single character. The cards are thick cardboard stock that will hold up to some abuse. The colors are very nice and bright. They are only printed on one side, with the same pattern on the back of all the cards.

I really wanted more out of this. There is nothing there to keep your kid's attention. My 5 year old has been reading for 2 years now and will happily sit still to read a book, but has no interest in these cards. I don't think it is a lack of patience on her end, but more of a lack of excitement from these cards. She recognizes most of the fairy tale characters but still doesn't really want to play with this. If they want it to be more portable, maybe include a mesh bag or something as well. Make the cards much smaller so you can actually lay them out when you are entertaining your kids.

 If you are looking to take this product traveling deflated it folds up very small and should be easy to pack away.

It is a little hefty in size, but it will still fit on your standard BRIO (or similar) track.  The lights and sounds are of course battery operated, which are simple enough to install.  However, in my review of the battery operated BRIO Freight engine, this one does not hold up by comparison.  Due to its size along with all the sounds, the battery life does drain quickly; I would say about a week with heavy use/play.  Also due to its size, it will occasional struggle uphill or derail on some turns.

The lights and sounds are great, but speaking as a parent, they may get a little irritating after awhile, especially the button to put the train in reverse; the reverse sounds are a blaring horn and bell.  Fortunately, there is an option to switch the sounds off altogether and use the train on its own without the battery operated functions, which I greatly appreciated.  More than that, my little girl greatly appreciated the new train, and that's enough to keep me satisfied!",1525046400,4,train great bright color light bell whistl make choochoo kid love littl hefti size still fit standard brio similar track light sound cours batteri oper simpl enough instal howev review batteri oper brio freight engin one hold comparison due size along sound batteri life drain quickli would say week heavi useplay also due size occasion struggl uphil derail turn light sound great speak parent may get littl irrit awhil especi button put train revers revers sound blare horn bell fortun option switch sound altogeth use train without batteri oper function greatli appreci littl girl greatli appreci new train that enough keep satisfi

The only problem is, it's rather boring.  If I was creative enough to make my own stories up to go with the tiles, it might be better, but I'm surprised there's just nothing like that included.  They pictures are generally cute, but well, it's just pictures.

She was bored with it in under 5 mins, and frankly I don't blame her.  It would be nice if I had the ability to think of creative ways to use this, but I don't, and that's why I buy toys that do.  But this one don't.

I'm going with 3 stars, but basically because they're well-made and well-printed.

It's made decently enough - the tiles are light, back is exactly the same on all, printing is well-done.  It's just that the animal faces are a little too ... round?  Similar?  Overly-cutsey-fied?  Not realistic?

I feel like I'm saying ""here's a bear"", but then she sees a bear online and doesn't recognize it, and I have to say ""Well that's a bear, too"".  I don't know if I'm being overly picky, but, well, it's my review.

It works perfect for us because we have carpet though. Wish it had some sort of weight to it, but its overall a great purchase!

Edit: 3 months now and this is still great. My son uses it everyday. We have a lot of fun sliding his cars down the slide. We use it to help us build forts as well.

16851,619,4175,"If you like watching movies or TV shows youll enjoy playing this game. Two to sixteen people can play at one time, or form teams for when you're stumped and a word is on the tip of your tongue, maybe your teammate knows what you're wanting to say. The instructions say its for ages ten and older, and while thats mainly true, it helps to have a broad knowledge of film. True buffs may want to stick to playing with other serious movie watchers for a faster, more strategic game.

The unique thing about this trivia game is that the cards are not designed in the usual sense, like Trivial Pursuit, where questions with definitive answers are provided. And no, you don't have to create questions of your own. Rather, the first player starts a Take by laying down a Trivia Card, which are divided into four categories - movie, actor, role, and quote. The player then merely provides the name of a movie, role, character, or quote in a film. The next player reveals a card and connects the first play to their Trivia card. For instance - Movie Card is played, person says Psycho. Role Card is played, that player says Norman Bates. There are no questions about it, no answers, just links. A link can be challenged, however. We get actors and quotes confused all the time, so penalties can be incurred if a player proves you another wrong.  There are also Strategy cards that can Reverse Angle, aka play direction, Cut or end a Scene, and more.

The game continues until a player runs out of cards and wins. This game is very versatile in that various movies from all genres and time periods can be played, or it can be limited for a more challenging game or to make it easier for children.  You can also go beyond movies to television shows, stage shows, even books, just replace the Actor for the author and illustrator. There are also other tips provided in the instructions for various ways to play.

I recommend watching the online video to get a better idea as to how to play the game in addition to the instruction pamphlet. Beyond the game itself, the cards (just shuffle them all together) are stored in a sturdy box with a magnetic closure for easy access and cleanup - wish my UNO cards came in this box, too.",1525305600,4,like watch movi tv show youll enjoy play game two sixteen peopl play one time form team your stump word tip tongu mayb teammat know your want say instruct say age ten older that mainli true help broad knowledg film true buff may want stick play seriou movi watcher faster strateg game uniqu thing trivia game card design usual sen like trivial pursuit question definit answer provid dont creat question rather first player start take lay trivia card divid four categori movi actor role quot player mere provid name movi role charact quot film next player reveal card connect first play trivia card instanc movi card play person say psycho role card play player say norman bate question answer link link challeng howev get actor quot confus time penalti incur player prove anoth wrong also strategi card revers angl aka play direct cut end scene game continu player run card win game versatil variou movi genr time period play limit challeng game

Otherwise you will end up with a box of 72 loose tiles and you will have to sort through to find matches if you want to play with less than 72 tiles (which lets be honest, when you first start playing with a toddler, you probably are going to use like 6 or 10 tiles per game)",1525392000,5,great version memori eric carl illustr beauti tile good size littl hand cardboard durabl upon arriv tile sheet cardboard grid must pop recommend detach tile one sheet time child readi play lot tile recommend get rubberband split tile categori easier game play farm aniim jungl etc otherwis end box 72 loo tile sort find match want play le 72 tile let honest first start play toddler probabl go use like 6 10 tile per game

She still asks for them often in the car (she got them 2 months ago), and they often entertain her for a decent amount of time, but that first weekend was like a miracle.  All the adults in the car were ready to leap out while it was going at full speed, but we all agreed that it deserved 5 stars for the amazing effect it had on my daughter.

The songs cut off at awkward places, the kids' voices are annoying, the music in the background sounds poorly recorded and amateur...

17081,619,4146,"My youngest daughter has been very into Paw Patrol for a long time, and I suspect we have more figures and vehicles than I had of Star Wars back in the '80s. We now have all four of these Flip and Fly toys, which are really Paw Patrol meets Transformers. The figure is pretty standard, very identical to others we have (many times over in some cases), but the vehicle has the added gimmick of transforming into a rescue flying toy. It sounds cool, and my daughter was excited but in execution, it's not quite as sturdy as one would hope.

Unlike Transformers which seem to lock in place, these Paw Patrol Flip and Fly vehicles have a very hard time staying closed. Of the four we have, Rubble is the best and my daughter really loves the little rescue hook on the bottom (found on all four vehicles). The projectile function mostly works, but it can get jammed easily when little fingers cram the missle in place. Unlike most Paw Patrol toys, I just don't see these lasting. They've been something of a frustration for my daughter in trying to keep them in their ""normal"" place (her word for the regular vehicle), because the wing pieces keep coming loose. If you already have the standard vehicles separate from these, it might be good to just let these exist as flying toys and not worry about the transformation process. I recommended this to my daughter, but of course, transforming them is the ""best part.""  All in all, Rubble works the best and gets four stars, while the others are all solid threes.",1525478400,4,youngest daughter paw patrol long time suspect figur vehicl star war back 80 four flip fli toy realli paw patrol meet transform figur pretti standard ident other mani time case vehicl ad gimmick transform rescu fli toy sound cool daughter excit execut quit sturdi one would hope unlik transform seem lock place paw patrol flip fli vehicl hard time stay close four rubbl best daughter realli love littl rescu hook bottom found four vehicl projectil function mostli work get jam easili littl finger cram missl place unlik paw patrol toy dont see last theyv someth frustrat daughter tri keep normal place word regular vehicl wing piec keep come loo alreadi standard vehicl separ might good let exist fli toy worri transform process recommend daughter cours transform best part rubbl work best get four star other solid three

17191,619,4243,"My youngest daughter has been very into Paw Patrol for a long time, and I suspect we have more figures and vehicles than I had of Star Wars back in the '80s. We now have all four of these Flip and Fly toys, which are really Paw Patrol meets Transformers. The figure is pretty standard, very identical to others we have (many times over in some cases), but the vehicle has the added gimmick of transforming into a rescue flying toy. It sounds cool, and my daughter was excited but in execution, it's not quite as sturdy as one would hope.

Unlike Transformers which seem to lock in place, these Paw Patrol Flip and Fly vehicles have a very hard time staying closed. Of the four we have, Rubble is the best, and unfortunately her two favorites - Marshall and Chase - seem to be the worst in terms of staying together. My daughter really loves the little rescue hook on the bottom (found on all four vehicles). The projectile function mostly works, but in all four of the vehicles, it can get jammed easily when little fingers cram the missle in place. Unlike most Paw Patrol toys, I just don't see these lasting. They've been something of a frustration for my daughter in trying to keep them in their ""normal"" place (her word for the regular vehicle), because the wing pieces keep coming loose. If you already have the standard vehicles separate from these, it might be good to just let these exist as flying toys and not worry about the transformation process.

17201,2605,4247,"Overall this is a good starter battery powered ATV for very young kids. Cheap plastic created by form molding; low-quality parts overall.  This is my second purchase - the first one I had lasted about a year before finally falling apart.  However -- and the primary reason for my three star review -- is the battery charger.  First -- beware that it takes 18 hours to charge the battery for first-time operation (quite a disappointment for a young child who gets this as a gift, e.g., ""Sorry Tommy, you can't use this right now until tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow.... I know you want to ride it now, but it's not ready... etc.).  Second -- the charger itself is poorly designed.  There is NO indicator of whether the battery is taking a charge when it is attached, and the only way to make sure is to detach it, assemble it into the device, and check... then re-attach to continue the 18 hour charge.  This is simply poor engineering, as is the design idea that you must unscrew and remove the seat to access the battery, instead of having the plug accessible from the outside of the atv, so in other words you will need a screwdriver to disassemble this atv whenever you need to charge it.  Hence 3 stars is a fair review score for this item.",1525564800,3,overal good starter batteri power atv young kid cheap plastic creat form mold lowqual part overal second purchas first one last year final fall apart howev primari reason three star review batteri charger first bewar take 18 hour charg batteri firsttim oper quit disappoint young child get gift eg sorri tommi cant use right tomorrow mayb day tomorrow know want ride readi etc second charger poorli design indic whether batteri take charg attach way make sure detach assembl devic check reattach continu 18 hour charg simpli poor engin design idea must unscrew remov seat access batteri instead plug access outsid atv word need screwdriv disassembl atv whenev need charg henc 3 star fair review score item

Unlike other memory games, this is just fun to play with period. My toddler loves mixing and matching the cards into new animals, or sorting them by body part.

The quality of these is superb. They are the weight of a board book page. We might actually have these to pass down to someone else! I saw there is a holiday version of this which I plan to buy for a stocking stuffer.

Only reason for 4 stars is that it was difficult to put together. The legs that hold in the safety bar were difficult to get to screw in all the way because it was hard to get them correctly aligned. I messed with it for awhile and finally got it to go in correctly to where I feel safe letting my son use it. Other than that, great product.

EDIT: Beware of biting/teething toddlers! My son bit off a piece of foam from the safety handle!! I know this product is for ages 3 and above. My son is 2 and he does great on it, but he is getting his last baby tooth popping thru and he bites everything!!!

I thought they'd be fun for our son to learn his letters and numbers with, while sticking them to the window. We've only used them a couple of times so far. He doesn't seem to think they ""belong"" on the window, so when I stick them there, he just takes them off and either puts them on the floor or chews on them. He's only left tooth impressions on them - he hasn't actually taken a bite out of any of them (I don't LET him chew on them - he just chomps down until I can take it out of his mouth). They do seem very hardy. With more time, I'm sure he'll get the hang of playing with them. They did pique his interest, so it's a start! My only complaint, I guess, is that there's only one of each number and letter in the bag.

17277,5105,839,"The rules are simple, quickly learned, and there are a wide variety of play possibilities.  Average game with two players takes 30-45 minutes.  Basically, you score points by matching colors or shapes, crossword fashion, with the Qwirkle tiles.  It's a little like dominos, but more colorful.  Best played on a large surface, like a kitchen floor, although you can play on a table and make a rule that play can't extend beyond the edge of the table.

This is a great game for older kids, 8 and up; For younger kids, it takes long enough that they may lose interest.  When my niece was 7 she mostly played around with stacking the tiles.  By the time she was 8, she started to get into the game, and now, at 9, she regularly kicks my butt at Qwirkle -- and takes great delight in doing it, every time.

Thankfully, Petit Collage has other sets in the same format that you could possibly mix the robot parts with. Ideally, I think this requires parent interaction with their kids to keep it interesting.

Despite the appearance, it is a single shot and the other 'barrels' are just to hold bullets before transferring to the main barrel.  There is also a bullet chamber in the grip but it is too deep and bullets can be very hard to retrieve.  The scope can slide off, which is good because it is useless.  There is some wavy clear plastic for a lens in the scope which makes viewing difficult.  The gun takes the 'elite' size of Nerf bullets.  The two worst things about this gun are that it is very inaccurate, particularly when sighting through the scope (which is not at all lined up with the bullet trajectory) and it is of very limited power so bullets don't have the force to travel straight after about 4 feet or so.  We shoot at targets with our Nerf guns and this gun is useless for that.  My 4 yo tired of this gun in about 5 minutes and switched to his one his other guns instead.

17445,2911,3856,"We purchased this for a birthday gift for a mermaid-obsessed little girl who just turned 7.  Since my kiddos are older now, I had absolutely no idea what kind of jewelry kit she would like.  My now 12-year old daughter (who babysits for her) felt that this one would be perfect.  When it arrived, the box felt completely empty.  I actually had to wonder if there was anything inside except for the charms that showed through the peek through window of the box.  The charms were cute enough, but to be honest...this seemed like a super cheap jewelry set.  We were desperate, though, and given the fact that we live in the middle of Wyoming with no gift options, we were stuck.  We coupled it with a musical mermaid jewelry box (also purchased on Amazon) and wrapped it all up with fingers crossed.

When she opened it, she went crazy over the jewelry kit.  She couldn't wait to tear it open and start making bracelets and necklaces.  The charms in the viewing window were enough to convince her that it was perfect. It comes with a handful of pearls and beads, 15 seashell charms, and about 10 ribbons.  The quantity matched the photo that shows what comes in the box.  Yes the box could be smaller, but I like the fact that it has space to display necklaces and bracelet ideas.  A smaller box wouldn't allow for that or the viewing window which allows you to see before you buy.  I can't vouch for the quality, but I can tell you that there aren't many jewelry kits on the market or this age group that you can get for this price.  It might fall apart after a few wears, but given the smile and excitement on the birthday girl's face, I'd say it was worth it.",1525824000,4,purchas birthday gift mermaidobsess littl girl turn 7 sinc kiddo older absolut idea kind jewelri kit would like 12year old daughter babysit felt one would perfect arriv box felt complet empti actual wonder anyth insid except charm show peek window box charm cute enough honestthi seem like super cheap jewelri set desper though given fact live middl wyom gift option stuck coupl music mermaid jewelri box also purchas amazon wrap finger cross open went crazi jewelri kit couldnt wait tear open start make bracelet necklac charm view window enough convinc perfect come hand pearl bead 15 seashel charm 10 ribbon quantiti match photo show come box ye box could smaller like fact space display necklac bracelet idea smaller box wouldnt allow view window allow see buy cant vouch qualiti tell arent mani jewelri kit market age group get price might fall apart wear given smile excit birthday girl face

17522,1012,3903,"These are lovely blocks. Like all the other Petit Collage products I have the illustrations are simple, but pretty. They have a nostalgic quality about them.  The blocks themselves are a sturdy cardboard and should be able to withstand a decent amount of punishment from a toddler. The blocks have letters on two or sometimes three sides (with pictures of a sea animal that starts with those letters) and numbers  on the other side. On the top side of the block it says the number and letters and the name of the animals. When stacked up they are about 2.5-3 ft tall. It's pretty fun for little ones to practice stacking these as they are often taller than them, and then of course knocking them down is much more fun.

I've had other nesting blocks similar to these, and there are a couple of things I think would prefer.

1.) The letters start at the bottom (that is A and B are on the largest block) so when you stack them the alphabet goes from bottom to top, which is a little weird.
2.) The letters are on different sides of the blocks so you never get to see the alphabet from A to Z. I think you could double up the letter om the on side and add other things to the other sides (shapes, or seasons or something.)

These are small quibbles and my 2 year sure doesn't seem to care about that. Apart from the pretty pictures, I think the most instructive thing for him right now is trying to stack the blocks properly. It's so cute when he puts a big block on top of a smaller one and the small one disappears.

Colorful and great fun. This unicorn worked great at the lake. We used the handles on the float to tie a rope to the houseboat and the little kids could float on it. It was a lot of fun for the kids and gave us lots of picture opportunities.  There are so many of these inflatable pool toys to choose from, but the important thing to watch for is the size, to make sure to choose the one (or ones) that fit the people who will be using them, big or small.

When I first saw these inflatable pool items, I thought they were just for adults, because all the models seemed to be adults.  The inflatable tubes are actually too big for a child and you do have to watch children to make sure they don't swim under the very large items, like the Pancake Pool Float, which holds two adults and a small child plus very handy cup holders to hold drinks, a very nice, relaxing way to spend the day.",1526083200,5,got sever inflat item giant inflat rainbow unicorn great favorit realli fun take pictur child play color great fun unicorn work great lake use handl float tie rope houseboat littl kid could float lot fun kid gave u lot pictur opportun mani inflat pool toy choos import thing watch size make sure choos one one fit peopl use big small first saw inflat pool item thought adult model seem adult inflat tube actual big child watch child make sure dont swim larg item like pancak pool float hold two adult small child plu handi cup holder hold drink nice relax way spend day

17675,5195,3043,"Well, first of all, they show these reflectors improperly installed. They should be facing the other way towards the pilot, then the antennae pointing straight out. Or, even pointed down somewhat, so that the signal is bounced skyward and forward (the direction you are facing as you pilot your drone). That is, if you're holding the controller in the position in the picture, as most of us do. Aside from that, lets talk about the product itself. There are many versions of this thing out there. This one is superior for a couple of reasons. 1) The reflective metal is of a slightly thicker gauge, providing more and better signal reflection. 2) the openings where the antennae slide into are rubberized, allowing for a snugger slip free fit. another plus is that the two halves are hinged, and can be separated. This allows you to either keep the antennae parallel or angle them slightly apart (for those of differing opinions on which provides the best signal). The Phantom drones have excellent range anyway. This is just a little extra insurance against lost or scrambled signal. I recommend this product.",1526083200,5,well first show reflector improperli instal face way toward pilot antenna point straight even point somewhat signal bounc skyward forward direct face pilot drone your hold control posit pictur u asid let talk product mani version thing one superior coupl reason 1 reflect metal slightli thicker gaug provid better signal reflect 2 open antenna slide rubber allow snugger slip free fit anoth plu two halv hing separ allow either keep antenna parallel angl slightli apart differ opinion provid best signal phantom drone excel rang anyway littl extra insur lost scrambl signal recommend product

17703,1863,4196,"This says it's for two but I'm a bed hog (and apparently a pool float hog) so I personally think it's a one person or two child/teen float.

Word to the wise. Don't even TRY to blow this up manually. You need a pump to blow this up or you're going to pass out (and best to use an electric pump unless you want to be inflating this thing forever). The float itself is comfy and stable. Much better than I had expected. It does seem like it will hold up well over time and endure a bit of abuse. I also really like the pillow. And the cup holders are great. They actually do hold your cups without dumping them as long as you remember to hold them when you get off of this float.

With all of that being said, it's rather large. If you have a small pool, this isn't the pool float for you.

Overall, this is a great pool float if you want to snuggle in the sun (or kick your partner off and keep it to yourself) or if your kids like to share pool floats.

17709,5138,1474,"For a Nerf blaster that was released nearly six years ago this is still solid choice.

The sleek design has very little wasted space. The included 25 round drum is much sought after and 18 round stick magazines easy to get as spares. Magazines with 6, 12 and 35 rounds are also available. I like to use this with an 18 round stick magazine, which makes it feel like a Sten gun or the later Sterling sub-machine gun.

Having the priming handle in front and underneath the blaster is simply the most ergonomic layout, and really all springers should have this design.

The stock attachment doesn't fit into every Nerf stock because of the longer tail, but does fit the most comfortable, sturdy and popular choice which is available to buy in several colors here on Amazon. Not including a stock in this package keeps the cost down since most Nerf enthusiasts will have their own choice of stocks anyway.

The range, at least from mine, is not the claimed 75 feet (I use a long tape measure in the garden when testing), more 45-60 feet range, but various replacement spring kits are available online if you feel confident modifying. Do not attempt modifying unless you know what you are doing and have watched several videos to show how it's done. Also don't use modified blasters with younger children (under 10) as the darts inevitably hit harder, and always wear eye protection whether or not your blasters are modified.

17777,1332,1063,"I love this play food. It's the most realistic stuff I've been able to find. The pieces are also very durable and easy for little hands to grasp and play with. My sister has a few sets of Learning Resources play food for her kids, so I was familiar with the brand when I purchased this set for my son for his first birthday. My sister's sets are several years old and are still in perfect condition (except for the ones the dog chewed holes in). The paint does not come off with wear, and the kids haven't bitten through or torn off parts of the plastic, either. They're firm but squish-able, and the material is smooth to the touch but not slippery, so little kids can grab onto it without a problem. Though they're not ""life-sized,"" the fruits and veggies are a good size for kids, too - they're not small enough to pose a choking hazard, but also not too big. They're also not to scale -- the head of lettuce is about the same size as the onion, the ear of corn is about four inches long, etc -- but the shape, coloring and details are all very life-life. The tote in this set is a cute little addition. A good size for my one-year-old, and all of the fruit fits in it well, without being so full that they fall back out.

I'll be buying more Learning Resources play food for my son in the future! For now, this 16-piece set is a perfect starter set. I don't need 30-something pieces of play food all over my house... yet :)",1526256000,5,love play food realist stuff ive abl find piec also durabl easi littl hand grasp play sister set learn resourc play food kid familiar brand purchas set son first birthday sister set sever year old still perfect condit except one dog chew hole paint come wear kid havent bitten torn part plastic either theyr firm squishabl materi smooth touch slipperi littl kid grab onto without problem though theyr life fruit veggi good size kid theyr small enough pose choke hazard also big theyr also scale head lettuc size onion ear corn four inch long etc shape color detail lifelif tote set cute littl addit good size oneyearold fruit fit well without full fall back ill buy learn resourc play food son futur 16piec set perfect starter set dont need 30someth piec play food hous yet

I said it's your birthday money you get what you want if you're able to get it and that's what you want then you get it while you have the chance. I also myself would have loved to gotten this doll for her back in December for Christmas but it was alot. But the price went down a little bit on it, she was happy and she just loves it.

My only complaint so far is that the animal noises don't override each other -- if you put the lion into the lion spot and then immediately put the zebra in, the puzzle won't switch from the lion sound to the zebra sound. It has to finish one sound completely before it can start another.

As a random note, our puzzle makes the Zebra sound randomly -- nobody will even be in the room where the puzzle is, and we'll hear the zebra.

That being said they typically don't last the summer in our pool. I have much higher hopes for this one and I'll tell you why. For one thing the material is much thicker than a standard pool float. And for another the float is divided up into different compartments so that if there happens to be a leak in one the whole thing isn't a wash you have the opportunity to patch it successfully. Not that we've had any leaks yet and my kids are super into the game where you leap off the side of the pool and cannon ball on top of the float, so that in and of itself is a small miracle. When you first get the float it does have a really strong chemical smell. That lingered for us for quite a few days even in and out of the pool. It seems to have dissipated now but just a heads up if you have a small space you will be able to detect the smell from far away and up close it's very strong.

18085,774,1617,"I bought this for my 6 year old who loves dinosaurs and we had a blast chiseling the eggs and finding our dinosaurs! The kit comes with 12 hard clay eggs that you have to soak for about 5 minutes in a cup of water to soften the clay. Each egg is individually wrapped and comes with it's own directions and chisel, so if you are using this for a class or birthday party, everyone has their own materials to use. I also love that each egg has a different dinosaur in it so there are no duplicates within the kit and the element of surprise is so much fun!

Once you have soaked the egg, use the chisel to chip apart and scoop the clay. After a few minutes, you get a small dinosaur about an inch or two tall. She likes to play with hers in the tub. These are kind of expensive, but they are a lot of fun and educational because the kit comes with a pamphlet that tells facts about each dinosaur and you can also practice classifying them by plant or meat eater, two legged or four legged, etc. There is so much to do with these! There are other kits as well such as sea life and wild animals that I plan to purchase.",1526515200,5,bought 6 year old love dinosaur blast chisel egg find dinosaur kit come 12 hard clay egg soak 5 minut cup water soften clay egg individu wrap come direct chisel use class birthday parti everyon materi use also love egg differ dinosaur duplic within kit element surpris much fun soak egg use chisel chip apart scoop clay minut get small dinosaur inch two tall like play tub kind expens lot fun educ kit come pamphlet tell fact dinosaur also practic classifi plant meat eater two leg four leg etc much kit well sea life wild anim plan purchas

These are now our ""go-to"" birthday presents for our son's friends and we have since bought 3 more for a total of 5 from Cherrywing. We have another one of a different brand in the house which is a bit harder to control/fly because it is faster and snappy response.
They are easy to fly, but it is suggested you learn how to slowly lift and land before trying to maneuver around. Most should be able to learn within 1-2 recharges.

As other reviewers have stated you better have a compressor or electric air blower-there is many, many, compartments to fill up with air. I would complain about all the compartments but it makes sense to have so many in case one area gets popped  it won't deflate the entire pool. Be careful,  I did pop the smallest compartment at the bottom of the slide because it does not take much air, but did not hurt the pool in anyway, its still held water just fine.

Water squirts out of the little palm tree and water squirts out of the top of the doorway with the stringy things.  There is an nozzle so you can adjust how fast the water comes out, or you can just adjust with your hose.

The slide was surprisingly sturdy holding my 18-month-old grandson with no issues.

When blowing up all the compartments I did not take the time to secure the plugs in there so it lost air in some of the compartments, but did not affect it at all while my grandson played in the pool.  Totally my fault.

It includes a few balls that float and can be thrown into the dinosaurs mouth and then comes out into the pool. The dinosaur blows up separately and can be secured to the bottom of the pool with plastic hooks.

 There is a drain plug to drain the pool when you are done, or you can just dump it out by lifting it up as a did.  Once all the water was out, I took the hose to my vacuum cleaner and pinched the plugs opened and sucked all the air out of the compartments and placed in a trash bag to store in my shed until the next time my grandson returns.",1526515200,5,div idvideoblockr38dd86z35ki1b classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesi91z9s3nolksmp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesia1wxyeajuspng classvideoslateimgurlnbspthi worth 33 paid review state better compressor electr air blowerther mani mani compart fill air would complain compart make sen mani case one area get pop wont deflat entir pool care pop smallest compart bottom slide take much air hurt pool anyway still held water fine water squirt littl palm tree water squirt top doorway stringi thing nozzl adjust fast water come adjust hose slide surprisingli sturdi hold 18monthold grandson issu blow compart take time secur plug lost air compart affect grandson play pool total fault includ ball float thrown dinosaur mouth come pool dinosaur blow separ secur bottom pool plastic hook drain plug drain pool done dump lift water took hose vacuum cleaner pinch plug open suck air

1. I swore this said it was for two people when I got it, though upon reading the product description I can't find that distinction anywhere, so I'm not sure what happened there. Anyway, it does not fit two adult people laying down. It's oversized but I guess for one or an adult and maybe a kid.
2. It has a weight limit of 200 pounds. This does not affect me, as I am well below 200 lbs, but that seems a little low. It's a big float, you'd think it's work for bigger folks. (I'm not saying 400 lbs or anything, but 200 seems low.)
3. It says that you can't leave it in the sun or outside, but it's gigantic! Where am I supposed to store this thing? (We have a large pool so it's for home use and we keep it inflated because inflating it and deflating it for use each time is too tedious.)
4. The air valves are on top of the floaty instead of on the bottom so you feel them under your legs while you are laying on the pancake. It's a little uncomfortable.

We inflated it using a hair dryer on the cool air setting and that got it mostly full, but we had to do a little bit of manual inflation to finish it off.

18221,1332,170,"I bought this for my son's first birthday. He loves buttons (as do most babies) and playing with anything electronic (again, as do most babies), especially things that we don't want him to have (again... as do most babies. Haha). He's infatuated with our cell phones, the TV remote, the XBox remote, etc, and likes it when he can push buttons (like the power button on the XBox remote) and something happens. While I generally don't really care for electronic toys for very young children, this one is basically just for teaching the alphabet, so I'm fine with that. I didn't like level 1, which has the buttons make sounds or say the animal/objects' name (C is either ""Cookie"" or it makes a crunching sound), so I put it on level 2, which says the name of the letter or the animal object's name. My son plays with it occasionally. He just got it a week ago, so we'll see how it goes.

. It's a great size. Perfect for little hands. Not too big, not too small, not too heavy. A great size for sticking into the diaper bag.
. The voice is clear and not super annoying
. The buttons are easy to press
. The songs are cute
