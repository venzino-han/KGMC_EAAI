18426,4250,4138,"My newest game purchase belongs to Agricola. I had played the iPad digital version for awhile and liked it quite a lot so I figured I would just nab the fully legit board game version. In this game you are a farmer! Dont worry its a lot more fun than getting up at 4AM and spending an entire day tending to your crops and animals I assure you. It is a worker placement game where you and up to 3 others ( 1- 4 player game) take turns placing your little wooden meeples on the board in varying locations to collect the specific resource on that location.

Each player starts with 2 meeples and there are a ton of things to do and this leads into my one negative about the game, which Ill get into in a bit. There are a number of cards that you place down after every turn that reveals a whole new area to place your meeple and sometimes unlocking new resources to collect and put to use. You place your meeple and collect your resources, then the next player does it and so on. You cannot place your meeple on the same spot that another player uses. That is the basis to the game however the game moves FARRRRR too quickly to really allow you to take advantage of everything the game has to offer. There are a TON of items here to utilize. As far as resources go we have grain, pumpkin, food, stone, wood, reed, clay, cattle, wild boar, sheepuhmmm I think thats it.but thats a TON. Now it wouldnt be that bad if the game was spread out a little more, like had longer rounds.

You see at the end of the phase you have to harvest your crops, feed your family andwellyour animals breed and multiply. Each meeple you control require 2 food and if you don't have enough food then you have to collect a beggar token for each food you lack. Each beggar token is worth -3 end game points which is huge and there is no way to get rid of them once you have them. The first phase you get 4 rounds to collect the required food and the other resources you need to do whatever you want to do on your farm. So its easy, plus you only have 2 meeples to feed, easy peasy. There are 6 total phases and as you progress you get less and less rounds to collect this stuff and yes as you get further along you do collect more (sometimes) but also there is more to do. Bottom line, the game feels a little like its rushing you. You don't want to have to worry about food to feed your family because dammit I want to build a stable and fences so I can raise hogs. And not just normal hogs mind you, WILD BOAR!

There is a very delicate balance to be played in this game that is for sure. The way the scoring is set up you have to focus on everything at least a little to not get any negatives however the speed at which the game is played makes it to where you really should only focus on 2 things if you really want to take advantage of all they have to offer. I feel like the game was made like this to create interesting strategies but for me and the other people I played with it just came off like the game was just a little too rushed.

As far as the tokens and other game components go everything looks really good. Everything token wise is made of wood and painted and also shaped like their corresponding materials. The wood looks like twigs and the pumpkins look like pumpkins. Best of all..the wild boar LOOKS like wild boar, makes it that much more satisfying when Im raising them and forgoing feeding my family. The card stock is a good quality for the cards that the game has for different professions and improvements. The board itself is rather unique and has a different sideboard that attaches for the different amount of players which is neat.

I will say it is the best farmer worker placement board game I have ever played however not the best worker placement game in general I have played. If you are looking for a different theme and love worker placements then this is the game for you.",1526860800,4,newest game purchas belong agricola play ipad digit version awhil like quit lot figur would nab fulli legit board game version game farmer dont worri lot fun get 4am spend entir day tend crop anim assur worker placement game 3 other 1 4 player game take turn place littl wooden meepl board vari locat collect specif resourc locat player start 2 meepl ton thing lead one neg game ill get bit number card place everi turn reveal whole new area place meepl sometim unlock new resourc collect put use place meepl collect resourc next player cannot place meepl spot anoth player use basi game howev game move farrrrr quickli realli allow take advantag everyth game offer ton item util far resourc go grain pumpkin food stone wood reed clay cattl wild boar sheepuhmmm think that itbut that ton wouldnt bad game spread littl like longer round see end phase harvest crop feed famili

18514,2476,2921,"First off, let me start by saying how much my husband and I love playing Pandemic. We've played the regular game over 100x and it's still exciting and challenging for us. We finally decided to buy Legacy Season 1 (blue) and it is worth every damn penny.

- The game is similar to Pandemic so if you're familiar with the OG game, then you'll get a kick out of the Legacy game. The writers are so creative and the game is interesting and fun, with lots of exciting new things to look forward to (ie: New characters, new actions, new virus, new structures, new rules, etc.)

- LOVE opening new packages, revealing new storylines, scratching off scratchers. I just hate how much trash it produces, and I hate the idea of permanently throwing away cards. The scratch-off element is fun but it gets messy.

- It's a fantastic activity for couples, a group of friends, and family. I love that it's a co-op game and it's not competitive. There is still a drive to win, but it's a collective goal that brings people together. My husband and I loved it so much we finished it in 1 week! We just bought Legacy Season 2.

- Only downside is the end of the game. Once the game ends, you're kind of left with a lot of useless pieces and cards. You can still play Pandemic the regular way, but the new game is basically thrown out the door. There are stickers that you add to the board that won't have any meaning once the game is over, but they are easy enough to scratch off and remove. You can still restore the game to the original setting, but I already have the OG Pandemic! I don't need another one. I wish there was a package you can purchase to play with the original game instead of buying a brand new game. It's hard to explain unless you've played this.

Overall, no regrets! I just wish the game never ended and that it lasted longer!",1526947200,5,first let start say much husband love play pandem weve play regular game 100x still excit challeng u final decid buy legaci season 1 blue worth everi damn penni game similar pandem your familiar og game youll get kick legaci game writer creativ game interest fun lot excit new thing look forward ie new charact new action new viru new structur new rule etc love open new packag reveal new storylin scratch scratcher hate much trash produc hate idea perman throw away card scratchoff element fun get messi fantast activ coupl group friend famili love coop game competit still drive win collect goal bring peopl togeth husband love much finish 1 week bought legaci season 2 downsid end game game end your kind left lot useless piec card still play pandem regular way new game basic thrown door sticker add board wont mean game easi enough scratch remov still restor game origin set alreadi og pandem dont need anoth one wish packag

18593,2451,2029,"I thought this was going to be like other toys we have, but as the months have passed this is one of the few toys they come back to again and again. I have a 5 and almost 3 year old playing with this. They both love locking and unlocking the doors constantly. My oldest likes to hide various toys in the little compartments and let my youngest ""discover"" them as she opens up the doors. You can hear her squealing in delight from across the house. As a parent, I love that everything fits inside this. The stethoscope folds up nicely inside the lid as well as the thermometer. The needle is a little spring injector that they use on their stuffed animals regularly. No threat of diseases in this house, LOL! This comes with a little stuffed cat and dog for your child to treat. My girls ended up keeping the stuffed animals in their beds, but still play with this set with literally every single stuffed animal they have. Like all of them.

There is a table on the side that slides out and a built-in X-ray machine. All in all this is super cute. Once all the pieces are inside the whole thing can be carried by the handle on the top. My 3 year old can easily carry this on her own around the house. We even take this in the car if it is going to be a long trip as there are no small pieces to lose and 2 kids can easily play together with this without fighting. There is plenty of room for sharing. Lots of hand-eye coordination practice with the doors, and then more cognitive work to examine and treat your ""patients"". Lots to love, and I honestly wouldn't change a singe thing. It also cleans up super easily because everything is that same type of plastic that is really easy to wipe off.",1527033600,5,thought go like toy month pas one toy come back 5 almost 3 year old play love lock unlock door constantli oldest like hide variou toy littl compart let youngest discov open door hear squeal delight across hous parent love everyth fit insid stethoscop fold nice insid lid well thermomet needl littl spring injector use stuf anim regularli threat diseas hous lol come littl stuf cat dog child treat girl end keep stuf anim bed still play set liter everi singl stuf anim like tabl side slide builtin xray machin super cute piec insid whole thing carri handl top 3 year old easili carri around hous even take car go long trip small piec lose 2 kid easili play togeth without fight plenti room share lot handey coordin practic door cognit work examin treat patient lot love honestli wouldnt chang

The removable and slightly 2-D stickers stay put well,  but almost too well, to easily change scenes. Once she put all the stickers on, she was done.

* TIP: save the clear plastic sheets that the stickers come on so that later you can remove them yourself from the scenes and be able to get many more uses. We also have 2 other sets of this product and feel the same about all of themgreat for a time when you want independent play and its easy to transport!

I love that they are foam, but I did have difficulty storing them in the included box without pinching the foam and creating indents, so I have moved them to a different box. Also, the picture shows lowercase letters in all 5 colors, but my box had uppercase letters in orange and yellow and lowercase letters in green, blue, and red. This sounds silly to bring up, but it bothered me that when spelling out long names I had to use one color for the first letter and then could never repeat that color again. I'm sure for children's play this is fine. I'm using these for teaching. A huge bonus for teaching would be having the vowels in one color and the consonants in another, but that's just an idea.

18703,1863,4308,"I got these for my 4 and 5 year old daughters to communicate with and play with. They are usually connected at the hip but sometimes they will be playing in different rooms and will have to run across the house to say something they want to say or they yell back and forth if the rooms they are in are close enough. I was really impressed by the quality of these. I was expecting sub-par child-like quality. The sound is actually pretty clear and they can both understand what the other is saying when they talk back and forth. It was also very easy for them to learn to use, which was important to me at their age (but they seem to take to electronics rather quickly). Don't expect this to go over very long distances. My one daughter was back by the pool with her dad while I was taking my other daughter on a walk and the connection cut out pretty close to the house. I also notice the connection quality declines when one child is on one side of the house and the other is on the opposite side.

I really like the fact these are chargeable, which means no batteries. So far we haven't had any problems with charging or with these holding a charge. I'll update my review if that changes or if we run into any problems with these.

If you're looking for walkie-talkies for your little ones to play with these are a great choice.

Definitely a fun game and your kids can even make up their own rules, bringing imaginative play into it.

For starters, I handed the box to my husband and asked him to put it together. I was shocked when he basically just pulled it out of the box and unfolded it (WHAT) no tools, so easy, weary parents everywhere please REJOICE with me

My son is a giant, he just turned one but wears 2-3t clothes and is 30 lbs. He is very tall, not just a chub. This is perfect for him, he can get on and off by himself and LOVES it (so far he can only go backwards, but thinks this is hilarious). A normal sized one year old might have some trouble getting on this by themselves? just something to keep in mind

What surprised me most of all is that my 3 and 4 year old are also obsessed with this thing! They are not like their brother, they are smaller and so are still under the weight limit for it. Between them and the baby someone has been on this ALL DAY. We have a plasmacar, trike, big wheel etc in our basement and we took this down there so the baby could join in the riding fun too.

 The main purpose of this product works fine: It floats baby in water. However, I consider myself a capable enough person, but any time I attempt to fit the float (deflated, obviously) into the accompanying carrying case.. it makes me feel like Im 3 margaritas deep. The float & shade-canopy DO NOT FIT INTO THE BAG. Ive mauevered them enough to fit on an occasion or 2, but then the sunshades shape is altered, making it not stand upright (essentially unusable). Am I missing something here? My husband can basically build a house from the ground up, but he cant seem to figure out the problem either. The hassle of fumbling around with this big/awkward thing while supervising a 10 month old and a 3yo pretty much makes me not want to use it.

The package came with 10 different face designs in 5 different colors for a total count of fifty (50) round ink stamps.  they work really well.  Easy to use and so cute.  Children enjoy these self ink stampers for all sorts of things.  Less than one inch.  Great fun novelty toy.  Note not great for adults usage as they do sometimss give too much ink and bleed through the paper so not suggested for serious crafters.
These small ink stampers would be good party favors especially because each individual stamp is wrapped inside the package.  Also would be great for rewards and small prizes or for Halloween trick or treaters.

The box says not for children under three; I did it with my 5 year old granddaughter and though she loved it, she struggled with the actual painting.  The set comes in a very cute suitcase carrying case that can be used to store the tea set once it has been painted. It s a very stiff cardboard, covered with a paper that can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. You get 10 pots of paint, which the directions say to cut apart so that they don't tip over and spill. Note:  these pots were extremely hard to open; each one too several tries for me to open.  Despite this, all our paints were dried out and some could not be used at all .  See photos below.  If you make a mistake while painting or don't like the finished project, a little soap and water washes the paint off and you can redo it.  If a thin coat is applied, it dries relatively quickly, allowing you to paint over the top. Once you are happy with your design, you can bake the set in the oven and that will set the paint permanently. You get a very nice instruction book that not only gives instructions about the painting and setting, but it show examples of painting ideas, how to set the table for a tea party and even some punch out invitations to invite friends to a tea party. This set would provide hours of fun. NOTE: this is a pretend tea set and should NEVER Be used to drink or eat from.",1527552000,4,spicebox tea set great gift child love paint craft box say child three 5 year old granddaught though love struggl actual paint set come cute suitcas carri case use store tea set paint stiff cardboard cover paper wipe clean damp cloth get 10 pot paint direct say cut apart dont tip spill note pot extrem hard open one sever tri open despit paint dri could use see photo make mistak paint dont like finish project littl soap water wash paint redo thin coat appli dri rel quickli allow paint top happi design bake set oven set paint perman get nice instruct book give instruct paint set show exampl paint idea set tabl tea parti even punch invit invit friend tea parti set would provid hour fun note pretend tea set never use drink eat

* This summer she is going to be cleaning the school and will be taking my granddaughter with her most of the time.
* We decided to get her some kind of a set, to see if she was interested and to keep her from wandering.  She loves this sad.
* I had it out of the box and the pieces hanging on the rack when she got here at 7 AM this morning. She immediately went to them and selected the mop.
* If it had been wet she would have got some real cleaning done.
* During the day she has taken each of the pieces off and used them to the best of her 14 month old ability.
* They do have a piece of thin rope/thick twine that hangs them on hooks at the top of the storage stand.  Shes not good about getting them back on but she can sure get them off.
* This product description says for age 36 months and up. She is well under 36 month, however, it is working for her.
* About the wooden set. Outstanding. This is genuine, sanded smoothly, wood. Even the pole stand is sanded wood.
* The mop is an actual rag mop that I could  use inside. Even the broom and dust pan are totally usable.
* This is a fantastic set. Made exceptionally well.

19150,3076,4104,"Rick and Morty: Total Rickall is a sort of deduction card game designed by Matt Hyra that can be played as a cooperative game or a competitive game. The game supports 2-5 players and runs fairly quickly.

In the game's basic cooperative mode, players must try to figure out which of the house mates are real and which ones are parasites. This is done by everyone choosing a card to play from their hands then resolving those cards. These can trigger effects to confirm if characters are real or fake but also to mix them up to make things more confusing. Effects are typically tied card colors (blue, green, red) or some special white cards that have other effects. At at time the players think that all the parasites are dead, they can check all the characters if they are real or a parasite.

In the advanced mode, players have a particular character in front of them that may also be real or a parasite. Now players can be on one of two sides - those supporting the real family members and those supporting the parasites. The real people naturally want to clear out all the parasites while the parasites need to keep at least one parasite alive until the end of the game.

What I Liked: With very simple rules, the game nicely found a way to capture the feel of the episode and translate it all into a pretty good card mechanic. It's a different spin on the usual sort of loyalty / traitor games out there and nicely adapts to both cooperative play and competitive play. The basic mode is hard enough with new characters joining the table every round but the advanced game can be pretty bonkers.

The advanced mode is really where the big fun is as it adds a whole new level of gameplay to things. It's sort of like what the advanced rules for Legendary Encounters as the core challenge of the game itself remains but now you need to figure out who's on your side. It's not like you know who else are Real or Parasites among the players and card effects also allow you to switch around the cards including those in front of players. So it gets rather bonkers.

What Could Have Been Better: That said, the basic game is quaint but can get really boring the moment you try out the advanced rules. The core challenge of finding all the parasites can be mitgated pretty quickly when you have at least 3 players in the basic game. It does keep it safer for a larger audience but at the same time it could have been maybe a notch or two higher on the difficult ladder.

I'm not sure if the final dinner table scenario in the advanced game was absolutely necessary in order to find an end to the game. Sure it makes things interesting and it forces everyone to make a final decision regarding the situation and whether or not it's ""safe"" for your team (whoever they are). It's quirky and messy but maybe not the best way to go.

TL;DR: Rick and Morty: Total Rickall is one of the best Rick and Morty games in circulation but it's not necessarily a home run. It's certainly a lot of fun and it pays off to learn how to play the advanced rules as soon as possible in order to get the most out of this game, especially among more experienced players.",1527724800,4,rick morti total rickal sort deduct card game design matt hyra play cooper game competit game game support 25 player run fairli quickli game basic cooper mode player must tri figur hous mate real one parasit done everyon choos card play hand resolv card trigger effect confirm charact real fake also mix make thing confus effect typic tie card color blue green red special white card effect time player think parasit dead check charact real parasit advanc mode player particular charact front may also real parasit player one two side support real famili member support parasit real peopl natur want clear parasit parasit need keep least one parasit aliv end game like simpl rule game nice found way captur feel episod translat pretti good card mechan differ spin usual sort loyalti traitor game nice adapt cooper play competit play basic mode hard enough new charact join tabl everi round advanc game pretti bonker advanc mode realli big fun
19151,3076,2087,"Happy Salmon is a card-based party game that is good for 3-6 players with a single copy of the game. It was designed by Ken Gruhl and Quentin Weir and can expand to 12 players with a copy of the blue ""expansion"" salmon.

The rules for the game are simple. Each player has a deck of cards that they need to get rid of to win the game. They do this by finding other players with the matching card active and performing the card action as directed. Thus far there are four separate actions. Pound It means you need to fist bump the other player. High 5 of course means to make a high five. Happy Salmon means you and other player slap each other's forearms in a fishy motion. And Switcheroo means you trade places with that player.

The game does require a bit of space to play and even if players seem to stay in their fixed positions, the Switcheroos inevitably lead to some movement and you'll lose track of your own actions the more cards you get rid of. The game has some variant play modes including a silent mode where you use hand gestures to indicate what card you're holding and this is its own brand of fun.

What I Liked: The game is brilliant in its simplicity as it's essentially a more dynamic game of Go Fish. It's super easy to learn and loads of fun across age groups. Our play group has been favoring the ""silent"" play option only because it has everyone laughing in their efforts not to say anything while gesturing wildly. It's hard to explain in words but thankfully the internet is filling up with videos of different people playing the game with increasingly larger groups.

Happy Salmon is a great example of a familiar game (in this case Go Fish and its variants) with a slight innovation to the game mechanics into something better. Turning the cards into actions and reducing the possible items to match all came together to create a pretty brilliant and celver game.

What Could Have Been Better: The game still has the chance to ""break down"" when you somehow end up with no winner within your group for some reason. Matching certain cards first can lock you all out of victory - and I can only cite experience in terms of how this happened. It's not a common problem but it can happen.

There is that slight wish that there was one more card variant to increase your options when you play. But of course I respect that they probably did a lot of play testing to figure out that this mix of four card types was enough to lock things in. Or maybe they left the door open for an expansion?

TL;DR: Happy Salmon is a simple but really fun party game that will change your social events forever. Just make sure you allot enough space and remember that the Happy Salmon gesture is my favorite.",1527724800,5,happi salmon cardbas parti game good 36 player singl copi game design ken gruhl quentin weir expand 12 player copi blue expans salmon rule game simpl player deck card need get rid win game find player match card activ perform card action direct thu far four separ action pound mean need fist bump player high 5 cours mean make high five happi salmon mean player slap other forearm fishi motion switcheroo mean trade place player game requir bit space play even player seem stay fix posit switcheroo inevit lead movement youll lose track action card get rid game variant play mode includ silent mode use hand gestur indic card your hold brand fun like game brilliant simplic essenti dynam game go fish super easi learn load fun across age group play group favor silent play option everyon laugh effort say anyth gestur wildli hard explain word thank internet fill video differ peopl play game increasingli larger group happi salmon great

My 7 year old has died a few times and pouts a little since she's out of the game. But usually the survivors just let her join in on the decision making when that happens though. And it doesn't happen very often. Usually we try very hard to keep each other alive. That being said, this is a fun game that our family likes to play because you are working together to solve the problem instead of against each other. I have a lot of fun when the game gets really intense and all the ideas the kids come up with to solve the problems and work together. The game does require a fairly large area to play in. We can do so on the floor or the dining room table, but it would be a tight squeeze on a card table. Game play for us has lasted anywhere from 15/20 minutes upwards of an hour depending on how the cards are drawn. I would recommend this game and highly encourage people to give it a fair shot once the rules are understood. If anything turns you off to the game fresh out of the gate, it can be the complexity of the rules. But once you understand them, it's a really fun game. Our ""learning mode"" is learn the rules as you play. It takes a really long time for the first play through when you do it this way, but it speeds up as things are better understood.",1527724800,5,great famili game rule mechan littl hit miss overwhelm first play game time learn mode realli understood everyth simpl easi game downsid charact die play younger one get upset 7 year old die time pout littl sinc she game usual survivor let join decis make happen though doesnt happen often usual tri hard keep aliv said fun game famili like play work togeth solv problem instead lot fun game get realli intens idea kid come solv problem work togeth game requir fairli larg area play floor dine room tabl would tight squeez card tabl game play u last anywher 1520 minut upward hour depend card drawn would recommend game highli encourag peopl give fair shot rule understood anyth turn game fresh gate complex rule understand realli fun game learn mode learn rule play take realli long
19158,3076,3528,"Tiny Epic Galaxies is a dice-driven strategy game created by Scott Almes. The game is a galactic exploration game of sorts that supports 1-5 players, which is rather impressive given its small size.

Each player controls their own empire and will work on expanding their dominion across the stars. The strength of your empire determines how many dice you will roll and the dice results will open up your possible actions in a turn. Dice will help you determine when you can move to new planets, advance your efforts to conquer those planets or copy the actions of others. And thus a single player turn can last longer than expected as spending Culture can give other players additional turns.

Conquering planets give you points but so do advancing your empire on your respective board and this unlocks additional ships to help in your exploration efforts. And you can focus on triggering the powers of planets that are up for conquering or you can focus on acquring them for yourself so you'll have exclusive control of those extra colony abilities.

What I Liked: I love how the game has so much serious strategic play in small box. This is the sort of strategic thinking that can rival big box games like Caverna and Tzolk'in despite its more limited size or whatever. Of course it's not exactly the same and those games are what they are for many reasons. But for a small box game, you have to show some appreciation for what they managed here. It's easy to underestimate games like this but I think we've learned that you can make an amazing game experience with just 16 cards like with Love Letter.

The ability to copy moves, albeit with a resource expenditure, was a pretty interesting move and it nicely shakes things up. And thus the dice mechanic doesn't feel so terrible since even though you don't get the results you want, there's a chance to copy the move of someone else as everyone else's rolls can still be useful to you provided your empire is cultured enough.

What Could Have Been Better: That said, this is still a dice game and you can feel how many different mechanisms they added to this game to help ensure you have a chance to get the results that you want. But at the same time it still means that you can still end up with bad rolls over and over again and without culture points you'll be dead in the water. And that can be more than a little frustrating.

And given the copying of moves and such, this game can also get pretty long as each player needs to decide whether or not they want to copy the move for every dice that the player rolls. And so as more dice are unlocked and culture reserves fill up, each player turn can take longer and longer as more decisions are triggered and branch out into infinite possibilities. It's still fun for the most part but at times the game can feel like it's starting to slow down more than you'd like.

TL;DR: Tiny Epic Galaxies is a great little game that totally lives up to the ""epic"" part of its name. Competition will be fierce and this dice game has a heck of a lot of strategy layered on top of things that will keep it pretty interesting every time you play.",1527724800,4,tini epic galaxi dicedriven strategi game creat scott alm game galact explor game sort support 15 player rather impress given small size player control empir work expand dominion across star strength empir determin mani dice roll dice result open possibl action turn dice help determin move new planet advanc effort conquer planet copi action other thu singl player turn last longer expect spend cultur give player addit turn conquer planet give point advanc empir respect board unlock addit ship help explor effort focu trigger power planet conquer focu acqur youll exclus control extra coloni abil like love game much seriou strateg play small box sort strateg think rival big box game like caverna tzolkin despit limit size whatev cours exactli game mani reason small box game show appreci manag easi underestim game like think weve learn make amaz game experi 16 card like love letter abil copi move albeit resourc expenditur pretti interest move nice

19222,1012,4330,"This is a good heavy duty dump truck to handle all your toddler's tough play. It's a sturdy plastic but with rounded edges so, you know, your kid won't poke an eye out or cut him/herself on a sharp edge. (My mom always talks about how she fell on a Tonka truck as a kid and had to get stitches above her eye. No worries about stitches with this truck!)

It's really a very large truck. The large wheels allow it to roll well on sand, dirt, or gravel. The bucket is really big and can hold a lot of stuff. My one criticism is that the bucket doesn't recline more than 45 degrees or so, and the edge of the bucket has a considerable lip so when you try to ""dump"" stuff out of the back, the things often don't fall out. My son put a random assortment of toys in the bucket and would try to incline the bucket to make the stuff come out but it simply doesn't move. If you put enough stuff (or sand) in it, stuff will eventually fall out, but not all of it. Because of that flaw, I took off a couple stars. If the back inclined more I would probably give it five stars. It depends on how important the dumping feature or a dump truck is to you.",1527811200,3,good heavi duti dump truck handl toddler tough play sturdi plastic round edg know kid wont poke eye cut himherself sharp edg mom alway talk fell tonka truck kid get stitch eye worri stitch truck realli larg truck larg wheel allow roll well sand dirt gravel bucket realli big hold lot stuff one critic bucket doesnt reclin 45 degre edg bucket consider lip tri dump stuff back thing often dont fall son put random assort toy bucket would tri inclin bucket make stuff come simpli doesnt move put enough stuff sand stuff eventu fall flaw took coupl star back inclin would probabl give five star depend import dump featur dump truck

In other words, it expands the range of play and especially with small kids encourages them to use their imagination. I think it is great because it encourages kids to ask, ""How can I use this? or ""What can I do with that?"" If you go to sandy places with kids, you will really love this bucket.

Part of me hates that I'm too lazy to just be that Pinterest mom who throws together markers we already own and paper in a cute way, but let's be real, if I'm prepping for a trip with three kids that is exactly the last thing I feel like doing. This is easy, pre-made, at just the right just-slightly-overpriced price point, and convenient. It has a good variety of marker colors, in perfectly tiny-hand sizes, and stores them securely in place in a way you couldn't easily engineer your PinterestFail into doing. The case has a handle for carrying and snaps to keep it closed. It's sturdy but light weight, and flat enough not to take up your entire carry-on bag. Honestly, I price shopped ""travel"" type pencil boxes for other activities: they are not cheap, and they are a lot thicker. Even with a Michael's 40% coupon, by the time you throw your own set together, you're going to be right around the same price.

But I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this game.

This is storytelling + game playing at its finest. You control one or more survivors of the Zombie Apocalypse, who are trying to survive the winter with their morale intact. And all the while the food and fuel are running low and the zombies are multiplying.

Will they be able to get to the various locations and find enough items to survive? Or will they die of zombie bites, frostbite or despair?

A small word of warning: this game is a bit dark and has somewhat complex gameplay, so it may not be appropriate for young children. Also, it's not a game you can just open and play.

Be prepared to spend a little time setting up and a little more time learning how to play. I suggest you watch a video the first time unless there's someone who's played it before to teach you. It has a moderately steep learning curve.

Think you can get your teammates to guess ""Jupiter"" and ""moon"" without guessing ""Saturn""? It's harder than you think because there are almost always multiple sets of words like that. And if you can figure out how to connect hotel, plot and turkey, you might be great at this game.

This travels perfectly and is quite sturdy for a toy of this price. We love the little toy box, as my daughter calls it, to store all the little loose pieces. One piece of tape will keep it secured if you are traveling and need to lay it on its side. My daughter decorated it with stickers as well. Gave it a personal touch. The only thing Id warn about is that the large sticker that goes on the table at the end of the bed ripped VERY easily (me pulling it off the sticker sheet). So be very very very gentle. We now just have a brown thing but she doesnt mind and Im sure itll get covered with stickers soon. This house is a good size if you don't have a lot of room in your house for a giant Barbie house.

19673,5105,1959,"I love this game, as do my young nieces and nephews, ages ranging from four to ten.

Basically, it's tic-tac-toe in 3D, with a twist:  once you place your ""gobblet"" on the board, another, bigger gobblet can land on top of it, gobble it up, and claim the space for your opponent.  But... the gobbler itself can be gobbled by an even bigger Gobblet!
More strategy required than simple tic-tac-toe, but on a 3x3 board it's simple enough that a 4 or 5 year old can grasp the concept -- and even beat their elders, now and then.  And excellent game for building concentration, strategic thinking, and focus -- and the goofy pieces are fun, too.

Some older kids (8-10) may find the game a bit to ""easy"", in which case I recommend its ""grown-up"" companion, the original ""Gobblet"":

https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Orange-100-Gobblet/dp/B00006L50P/

The original has a 4x4 board and more pieces, which ups the strategy level considerably:

My only complaint, for which I docked this version one star, is it was not made clear that there are \two\ versions of Gobblet Gobblers.  I bought this thinking it was the original wooden set, and instead it's a plastic set.  I didn't discover this until I was wrapping it for a birthday present.  Everything in the plastic set works fine, and it is a bit cheaper, but it just doesn't have the same ""quality feel"" of the original wooden version.

Wooden version:

The TRIM buttons will be your best friend. I also removed the camera (just two screws), so that it's lighter and can fly FASTER and DO MORE STUNTS, and a gives it a few minutes more battery life, per a Youtube video. BIG BIG ADVICE per one Youtube vid: Practice at 5 to 10 feet high and have the drone in close proximity to you when you are LEARNING. When you can control / master the drone, then you can let loose. This way you won't loose the drone. Makes sense to me!  I also used a black sharpie to color the front prop guard, and front landing skids to help see which is the front or back.

19788,3199,3987,"Role Player is a incredibly fun game about making a D&D character (w/o the license of course). The game is neck deep in theme. You even get a character sheet....er.....board, a character class, race, alignment and even a background! Neat!

At it's core, the game is about dice manipulation and placement to earn VPs and/or gain special abilities.  Placing dice to increase your stats give you a one time special action, which depends upon which stat you increased (each stat 'power' is different), and each class has a list of prime stats that you get VPs for each stat you match. Role Player then throws in cards (in the form of armor, swords, magic items, etc) that give you even more abilities, ways to gain VPs and so forth! Added to that, your character gets a ""background"" which allows you to score even more VPs by placing colored dice on certain spaces on your character sheet....er......board! You can score even more points by manipulating your alignment through a cube that moves towards evil, good, law and chaos depending on your actions!! Furthermore, the color of your dice (and equipment cards are also color coded!) and your character class (each class is color coded) can add even more VPs if your match them at the end of the game!

AAAHHHHH!!! So many choices, so much strategy!! But the game is simple and easy to teach!

If you ever rolled up a character in a paper and pencil RPG, you will LOVE this game. If you like Euro/AmeriTHRASH hybrid board games, you will love this game.

19866,4250,1801,"You know, I held off on buying this one for the longest time because I kept hearing that it was basically the big brother to another board game called Rising Sun (which is an excellent game btw). I was thinking to myself, Why spend the money on another board game that will pretty much play just like one I already own. And as Im sure most of you reading this review know, there are a TON of board games on the market right now to choose from, all with different playstyles and themes. Took a good 2 months before I finally broke down and bought Blood Rage. And UGH why didn't I buy this sooner?!

After playing Blood Rage I found that it has enough differences to the game play to differentiate itself from Rising Sun, not to mention the theme that if there are any of you out there worried about the same thing, well, you will not be disappointed with this purchase. So lets get down to it! Blood Rage is a 2-4 player game based around a cool Viking Norse mythology theme that is taking place during the events of Ragnarok! Ragnarok is basically the end times in Norse mythology. In the game you are placing your warriors on the game board to try to take control of certain areas to gain the benefits of said area. All in an attempt to gain Victory Points which is ultimately how you win. Now of course there are multiple different ways to acquire these victory points and thats where the fun comes in.

The beginning of the game you and the other players do this fun card drafting where you pick a card from a hand of 8 and then pass the remaining cards to the player on your left and rinse/repeat. This is a cool way to equalize the playing field so to speak as far as starting hands are concerned. Each player has a player mat of their clan which are all identical save for the clan names and colors. However they are the same starting out (equalized) over the duration of the game each one will change little by little depending on your playstyle. There are 3 different skill tracks on each player board that focus on either number of units on the board, total amount of rage you get each turn (action points) and how much glory you get for winning battles (victory points).

The cards in the game all pertain to a particular Norse god. Depending on what cards you decided to keep during the draft at the beginning will kinda give you an idea of how you want to play the game and which of the skills to upgrade. For example if you kept some Thor cards then you would gain more points for winning battles so you would focus perhaps on upgrading your skill for gaining glory for winning battles. On the other hand if you kept Loki cards you actually gain more points for LOSING battles (such a trickster) so you might wanna focus on upgrading your skill track to getting more units on the board to basically sacrifice. And these are just examples, there are so many other strategies and the fact that there are 6 different gods with totally different strategies for each.

As you go around the board and everyone expends their rage points to do stuff like battle or take over territories the turn phases will proceed. Once everyone has spent their rage points the game moves on to the discard phase where you discard all your cards save for one and then complete any quests you have played which give you different bonuses for completing specific situations during your turn. THEN RAGNAROK! During this phase one of the lands on the board gets obliterated and any units on it go to Valhalla (they DED). Again if you are focusing on Loki here it might be beneficial to move units to the place getting Ragnaroked just for the victory points. Any killed units during the regular play also go to Valhalla and after Ragnarok happens all units are released back to their respective players to be played to the board again during the next phase.

There are 3 total rounds like this with new more powerful cards being drafted at the beginning of each round so each round plays a bit differently. Also keep in mind that any units that survived the previous round are still on the board, so..killing off your units may have some benefit but its makes it that much harder to take over areas when you have to keep building up your army. Oh did I mention the MONSTERS! There are a few different powerful beasts that you can summon to the board to help you in a variety of ways. Each one has a different ability and once a person summons it, it belongs to them the rest of the game but they can be killed as well so they are not TOO over powered. Your player board has spots on it to upgrade your basic warriors, your leader, your monsters and your ship! Yes! You have 1 ship that you can place in fjords along the coast of a territory that acts as part of your army. These are unique in the fact that they border 2 different lands at the same time and give you strength in both.

Now all that out of the way, I would say I really really liked this game. Its pretty fast paced and I love the card drafting at the beginning. The minis look great as with any CMON game if you are familiar with them. What really surprised me though was how easy this game was to learn. I looked through the manual as I was setting the game up for the first time and by the time I had the game setup I pretty much knew how to play, 20 minutes tops. I referenced back a couple times for specific things but the player boards and the turn tracker board pretty much explain everything you need to know right there.

If I were to point out something I don't like about the game I guess it would be that there is a max of 4 players out of the core box. This is of course alleviated with the expansion for a 5th player but I absolutely hate the way a lot of game companies are releasing an extra player as basically boardgame DLC and charging for it. You can see this with Rising Sun as well. That said, if you usually play with 4 or less then this game is perfect.",1528588800,5,know held buy one longest time kept hear basic big brother anoth board game call rise sun excel game btw think spend money anoth board game pretti much play like one alreadi im sure read review know ton board game market right choos differ playstyl theme took good 2 month final broke bought blood rage ugh didnt buy sooner play blood rage found enough differ game play differenti rise sun mention theme worri thing well disappoint purchas let get blood rage 24 player game base around cool vike nors mytholog theme take place event ragnarok ragnarok basic end time nors mytholog game place warrior game board tri take control certain area gain benefit said area attempt gain victori point ultim win cours multipl differ way acquir victori point that fun come begin game player fun card draft pick card hand 8 pas remain card player

You'll have time to adjust the model in case their arms don't line up exactly while the glue is thick enough to resist minor amounts of pressure so the model doesn't ""crumble"" during adjustment.  Also much preferred when assembling vehicles or large models with long/broad gluing surfaces.

This tub will last quite a long time, just make sure you replace the brush/cap while fidgeting with the model so your glue doesn't dry out!!  Much better, to me, then Games Workshop plastic glue.

As the parent, there are a few things I don't like.  First, the dump portion is pretty free moving and does not click into place in any way.  If the kids push and run behind it, it's easy for this to ""dump"" backward if any weight is put on the back half of the truck.  Likewise, when you carry it, the dump portion flops around.

These are awesome additions and my kids got the biggest kick out of the pinwheel.  It's sturdy plastic too, so it won't get crushed. They've been using the watering can to help with the flowers.  The bag is great to carry the toys and has a mesh bottom but really is just a basic plastic product bag.  One thing I don't love is that the sand molds are not ""beachy"".

Its dumping mechanism operates much more smoothlythe other truck clicks and stays in an upright position, requiring a hard push to get it back down.  Thats not an easy task for one and two year olds, and often requires adult assistance.

Size is another issue.  This one is much easier to take to the beach or transport anywhereit still holds a lot in the dumper, and the kids have an easier time carrying it around.  The other truck is large enough to hold a small child, even though it wasn't made for that purpose.  Which one do I think will break first?  The larger truck definitely gets the most abuse at our housebesides the rough treatment required to get the dumper back down, the kids continually drop the truck because its so big or they're trying to sit in it.  Its only a matter of time before the plastic strips connecting the dumper onto the trucks base break.

The other truck comes with no accessories.  This one comes with a nice set of sand tools.  We have twins, so getting two of almost everything keeps a peaceful household.  The kids like both toys equally, but from an adult standpoint, I just think this truck is a more practical size, easier to operate and comes with some fun extras.",1528848000,4,two battat sand trucksthi coastal cruiser bigger 20 modelnbspa datahookproductlinklink classalinknorm hrefbbx1429z2034largesandtruckdpb01a6wv37krefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieutf8b bx1429z 20 larg sand trucka look almost ident smaller version two like one better dump mechan oper much smoothlyth truck click stay upright posit requir hard push get back that easi task one two year old often requir adult assist size anoth issu one much easier take beach transport anywhereit still hold lot dumper kid easier time carri around truck larg enough hold small child even though wasnt made purpos one think break first larger truck definit get abus housebesid rough treatment requir get dumper back kid continu drop truck big theyr tri sit matter time plastic strip connect dumper onto truck base break truck come accessori one come nice set sand tool twin get two almost everyth keep peac household kid like toy equal adult standpoint think truck practic size easier oper come fun extra
20097,4562,3263,"I was very happy with this product. The shade has excellent coverage to easily keep baby in the shade. It's fabric, not plastic so it doesn't have that VOC smell or slippery surface. It really does self inflate. No huffing and puffing or air pumps needed. All you have to do is turn a nozzle and the foam inside begins to fill with air, then you tighten the cap again. It's ready to go in a minute. In the water it is very stable. I've had floats in the past that were very unstable and could topple over. Not this one. When you're done it also deflates if you open the nozzle again and roll it up. This has saved us storage space as our house is overrun with kid stuff!

20127,5634,3987,"Roll Player may seem, at first blush, to be a game about creating a D&D-type character.

But in reality it hides a brilliant combination of dice-drafting and card-drafting challenges.

It's very easy learn, but challenging to play due to all the possible ways to score points, not to mention the random rolls of those pesky dice!

Players start with a character board, a class, a backstory, and an alignment. Each of these changes the possibilities for scoring points, which offers great replayability.

During each round, players will roll a certain number of dice and take turn drafting them to play on their character board. The goal is to match the number of points mandated by the specific combination of character, class and backstory and to get as many dice that match your class color.

Each die you place also allows you to take an action, such as swapping two dice, flipping a die to its opposite side, etc. You only get three of each manipulation per game, so there's strategy in choosing when to place a die in the row that will allow you to take that action. And all the while you are trying to put certain colors in certain places to score more points based on your backstory!

Then each player has the option of buying armor, a weapon, traits or skills from the market. Each of these items lets a player take certain actions during the game or score additional points at the end. Skills require a player to adjust his/her alignment up or down, which changes how many points get scored at the end.

So many decisions. Do I choose and lower number and get first crack at the items in the market? Do I choose a die that has a crappy number but matches my class color? Do I choose the highest number possible? And should I take that great skill even though it will force me to move my alignment to where I don't want it every time I use it?

The artwork on this game is gorgeous and the cards are top quality. Where it falls down slightly is in the quality of the other components. Punching out the die spaces on the player board has a tendency to rip the backside, no matter how carefully you do it. So the game looks a bit beaten up out of the box.

But... the rules are really well written and the solo mode is actually pretty playable, if not as challenging (or frustrating!) as playing with other people. So I think this will be on the top of my game pile for awhile.",1528848000,4,roll player may seem first blush game creat ddtype charact realiti hide brilliant combin dicedraft carddraft challeng easi learn challeng play due possibl way score point mention random roll peski dice player start charact board class backstori align chang possibl score point offer great replay round player roll certain number dice take turn draft play charact board goal match number point mandat specif combin charact class backstori get mani dice match class color die place also allow take action swap two dice flip die opposit side etc get three manipul per game there strategi choos place die row allow take action tri put certain color certain place score point base backstori player option buy armor weapon trait skill market item let player take certain action game score addit point end skill requir player adjust hisher align chang mani point get score end mani decis choos lower number get first crack item market choos die crappi number match

20324,1430,4349,"This is a cute set of blocks for working with your children recognizing emotions. My preschoolers and I have used these are few times now. I mix up all the pieces, get out the cards and then let them choose the faces, hair and body color that they believe each card expresses.

This is definitely not a toy that I would just give to my preschoolers to free play with. That would go great for about three and a half minutes and then they would probably lose interest. There's just not a lot to them without an adult. What I've done instead, is talk to them about each emotion. As they each take a turn and build a person we talked about why we think the person is that way. I'll ask why do you think they're angry, what could we do to help someone who is angry? Can we talk to them about how they're feeling? What do you think helps you when you're angry? What makes you angry? I find using them interactively is a great and healthy way to start some important discussions about self-awareness as well as being aware of other people's emotions. Could the paint be better on the faces? Yes. My kids had an easier time of deciphering the emotions on the faces than I did so I'm not sure what that says but they got all of them correct. Overall, I think this is a fantastic toy. I don't think it's one you just give to your kids and let them go for it I do think that parental or an adult's involvement is key in getting the most out of this.

We live across the street from a park with a sand surface, so our sand toys get daily play and shared with the entire neighborhood. This bucket is way too big to fit in my stroller cargo, but it hooks great to the handle of my stroller with a Mommy Hook. The toys included only take up about half the bucket, so I fill the other half with more toys and snacks. It's like an old-fashioned lunch pail!

I like that every part is a toy, even the lid. There are sand molds, a good watering can, a shovel and rake, and two cool tools I hadn't seen before: a wall smoother and round smoother for building. Every part of this is thick, durable plastic. From here on out, I will ONLY buy sand toys from B. Toys, Green Toys, or Melissa and Doug. Even the other pricier brands are flimsy.

Style of game:
- A more adult, more fun. more challenging version of Clue.
- Co-op

Positives:
- Great theme, we even dimmed the lights to set the mood
- Good, quality components.
- Beautiful artwork
- Fun to play for both sides of the table. Sometimes when games have 1 person that plays as something different than the others, once side ends up not having as much fun. That isn't the case with this game.
- Age rating seems pretty close. We played with a 12 year old and sit was good for her, challenging but fun. She even asked to play it again the 2nd night. She did have a little more fun and easier time at the ghost, but I think everyone will feel that way.
- Game play is pretty easy to understand, once you make it through the instructions.

Negatives:
- Instructions could be easier to follow. It took a while to learn because of that. We watched a video though, I'd recommend that.
- The screen for the ghost is a little too tall so it makes it hard to look over and see the rest of the cards on the table.
- Good replay value if you play with different people every 5 or so times. If it's the same group of people I could see this becoming slightly repetitive.

Personal notes:
- I wouldn't play this with someone you have never met or don't know being the ghost. It relies a lot on people's interpretations of the cards and if you have no concept of the thought process of the person playing ghost it could become frustrating, very fast.
- New players should play as ghost first. For us, it seemed to go a lot better that way.",1529366400,4,love game weve play 8 time sinc get enough time person play ghost oncetwic love definit board game play rotat style game adult fun challeng version clue coop posit great theme even dim light set mood good qualiti compon beauti artwork fun play side tabl sometim game 1 person play someth differ other side end much fun isnt case game age rate seem pretti close play 12 year old sit good challeng fun even ask play 2nd night littl fun easier time ghost think everyon feel way game play pretti easi understand make instruct neg instruct could easier follow took learn watch video though id recommend screen ghost littl tall make hard look see rest card tabl good replay valu play differ peopl everi 5 time group peopl could see becom slightli repetit person note wouldnt play someon never met dont know ghost reli lot peopl interpret card concept thought process person play ghost could becom frustrat

One downside which gives this four instead of five stars, is that the bed of the truck doesn't go completely upright, so it won't fully empty whatever is in it at the time.

20533,569,3444,"What makes Concordia such an excellent strategy game is its ratio of ""ease of play"" to ""depth of decisions.""  Once the components are set up, it takes less than 10 minutes to teach new players what to do on their turn, along with some basic winning strategies.  After a few turns, it becomes obvious that you can't do everything that you want to do, and you have to make significant choices about how to increase your score.  Concordia is all about the ""long game,"" but in terms of actual playtime, expect up to 30 minutes per player.

The goal is to gain favor with various Roman gods by collecting personality cards that you add to your starting hand.  On each turn you play one card to gain that personality's benefit (building, trading, recruiting, etc).  Those cards cannot be retrieved until you play the one that allows you to refresh your hand.  The game ends after all personality cards have been acquired by the players, or someone constructs all of their buildings.  Scoring is not generally done until the end (new players can make an intermediate score check), so you never really know how far ahead or behind you are until the final tally.  Highly competitive players might not enjoy this aspect, or the fact that competition in Concordia is indirect.  There are no ""gotcha"" or ""take that"" moments, but it is possible to make certain routes inaccessible, and to make buildings more expensive for opponents by getting to a location first yourself.

Some maps seem better suited for different numbers of players, and can slightly influence the overall feel of the game.  The double-sided map included with the game is suitable for basic ""expand and trade"" economics, but other expansion maps like Aegyptus have greater location density and tension.  If you like some of the ideas here, but don't want another ""trading on a map"" game, I also recommend Transatlantic by the same designer.",1529452800,5,make concordia excel strategi game ratio ea play depth decis compon set take le 10 minut teach new player turn along basic win strategi turn becom obviou cant everyth want make signific choic increas score concordia long game term actual playtim expect 30 minut per player goal gain favor variou roman god collect person card add start hand turn play one card gain person benefit build trade recruit etc card cannot retriev play one allow refresh hand game end person card acquir player someon construct build score gener done end new player make intermedi score check never realli know far ahead behind final talli highli competit player might enjoy aspect fact competit concordia indirect gotcha take moment possibl make certain rout inaccess make build expens oppon get locat first map seem better suit differ number player slightli influenc overal feel game doublesid map includ game suitabl basic expand trade econom expans map like aegyptu greater locat densiti tension

It's just a hassle to store all of the loose pieces when you take them apart.  Also, why don't they make and include curves at all?  That would really open up the possibilities a lot.

20606,5717,2007,"I write this review coming from a two player standpoint.

Overall I like the idea. A battle of Kaiju over Tokyo. At the start, it's a dice rolling press-your-luck game. Glorified Yahtzee. But what makes this unique is the dynamic of not healing while in Tokyo, the ticking clock of staying in Tokyo, and the cards.

What a shame, is that the game is over VERY quickly. And it seems like the cards and income accrual just aren't there before the clock runs out. I would much prefer it to last a little longer. Not using the cards are a shame because those are what makes the game more interesting!

Modified rules can help and are likely needed. Such as getting two energy cube (currency) per die. Or double health (""die"" then resurrect with a penalty, like a Street Fighter game).

I really do think it needs a second revision to address these issues.

But this is coming from the perspective of only playing in two player. A 4,5,6 player game may be totally different.",1529539200,3,write review come two player standpoint overal like idea battl kaiju tokyo start dice roll pressyourluck game glorifi yahtze make uniqu dynam heal tokyo tick clock stay tokyo card shame game quickli seem like card incom accrual arent clock run would much prefer last littl longer use card shame make game interest modifi rule help like need get two energi cube currenc per die doubl health die resurrect penalti like street fighter game realli think need second revis address issu come perspect play two player 456 player game may total differ

20625,5717,1748,"Pretty entertaining card game. But why does it need a board, big box, etc. It can literally be played with just the deck?

Pros:
- The game is simple to learn, but your opponent working against you is what provides the depth.
- The cards are beautiful. As you progress, they reveal a picture. They are large format, and VERY plastic coated.

Cons:
- Large cards make shuffling difficult.
- Would like to see a reduced cost version without box or board.",1529539200,4,pretti entertain card game need board big box etc liter play deck pro game simpl learn oppon work provid depth card beauti progress reveal pictur larg format plastic coat con larg card make shuffl difficult would like see reduc cost version without box board
