20662,5035,534,"I give this drone 5 stars for several reasons. One is the price. Very reasonable for a beginner drone. Comes in a very well packaged box with little assembly required. Because of the 6 gyros the drone flies incredibly stable indoors as well as outdoors and because of the sensitive throttle you can easily maintain hover. I recommend beginners to fly in headless mode as it's the easiest to navigate with. It has some cool features like function display on the contoller and can do flips in all 4 directions. LEDs will flash quickly indicating low voltage from the battery so it won't die on you mid flight. It also has 2 speeds. Low for precision flying and fast for a more race like experience. Camera is easy to install but I personally don't use it. There's a brief delay in image so you can't really fly using it, it's just something you can record off of. Image resolution is not the best but for the $$ what do you expect? Only a couple drawbacks and again because of the price they're more like wishes. One is there isn't a home function powered by GPS. If the drone goes out of sight, it's gone. Two is the range. I only got about 75 feet in the air before it lost signal and fell. Replacement parts and batteries are cheap from Amazon so pick up a set or two. I just ordered my 2nd one so my son and I can race. For my entire investment of about $100 I got: Complete drone with controller, battery and spare parts, one parts kit which has 20 props, 20 blade guards, 20 landing legs, 11 spare batteries with charger and 4 spare motors. That will supply me with enough spare parts for YEARS. Don't hesitate on this drone.

He hangs off plant pots, curls around charging cables, is known to perch atop the fridge to scare the next person who opens it, and has even been found staring at you from the top of the toilet while assuming the characteristic apologetic pose, lol!!

20752,596,3309,"This is a nice LEGO starter set. So often the LEGO City sets focus on police and fire, so it's refreshing to get a set with 'typical' city minifigures to help round out the population.

The helicopter is pretty standard for a LEGO set. The four minifigs are of the work/service variety, so if you're looking for some people to boost the industry portion of your LEGO city, these four minifigs will do just that.

I'm happy that LEGO has these starter sets as they allow the buyer to get several minifigs for a decent price. There are also several other types of starter sets that LEGO offers, so keep your eyes out as they seem to come out with new versions quite frequently.

Overall, I like this set (and the starter sets in general). Please note this set has been out a while now, so it may be nearing retirement and most likely won't be available to purchase for much longer. I recommend this set and I think you'll be pleased.

20836,806,1878,"I got the My Mini MixieQ's Winter Holiday Fashion Pack for around $2.50. That was  the price that day, no coupons were used. My review may come up as an unverified purchase but I bought them for the full price that day on Amazon. Having said all that...

These TINY things were a big hit with my 5 year old nice who adores really tiny toys. They have different wigs and different outfits to mix and match and two fully dressed ones can fit into the little box which comes with a plastic hook for a keychain, purse, or to just hold onto. There isn't much to these but my niece enjoyed discovering the many ways she could change up these little dolls. They are all hard plastic and fairly well painted. But, boy, are they a choking hazard. If you buy these for a child and there is a younger one around, please be so careful. A piece could easily drop and go unnoticed and the little one may see the bright color and try to eat it. It scares me just think about it.

Aside from these doing nothing at all and being a choking hazard, they're cute and inexpensive for the kid who likes itty bitty toys. These are by far the smallest things I have given my niece. They are even smaller than Hatchimals and those are tiny. I doubt a kid would be enthralled with these for hours and hours at a time but they're fun to play with and to mix and match hair and outfits to get just the right combo to carry in the little plastic box. Hey, they're better than kids staring at a computer or tablet all day.

The bench is super comfortable, but if you hit the edge just right, you can slide right off of it.  While that ""slide"" isn't adult-sized, it's still fun for me and my 2 year old loves to do it.  She also likes to tuck herself between the bench and wall.  The pool is big enough that I have had three inner tubes in there and still had room to sit on the bench completely.  I'm 5'6"" however and there's not a lot of extra room across the pool if I lay on the bottom.

Still, the pool is big enough that I can sit on the bench, put the 2-year-old in the medium-sized flowered inner tube pictured in this review, and spin her around or swish her back and forth in the pool quite easily.  She even paddles around with the tubes.

One warning:  DO make sure your ground is level.  Ours has just a slight decline which isn't very noticeable in the pool most days, but a thunderstorm filled the pool to overflowing and that stretched and started to drag the pool downhill.  The pool was very durable during this and returned to normal when we got rid of the extra water, but just something to watch for.  Also, there's a weird covered hole in the bottom on the right side of the bench.  The pool came with no instructions and I don't know what this is.  I tried to add air, but it doesn't have a stopper and no air seemed to be going in.  It doesn't go all the way through, so it's not a drain.

Danger factor:
I highly caution ParentS to supervise.
If the matchup is uneven, the smaller child goes FLYING!!! Major head/neck injuries are possible when a child flies backward, then head WHIPS the ground upon tube bouncing.

Some tips:
1- kids could use helmet :(
2- play outside on grass (or snow :( )
3- keep it above the waist line (tie rope to handles?)
4- opponents should be similar mass

Fun Factor:
They do have a lot of fun, but my older child takes a lot of restraint after our first injury. The novelty is revisited once in awhile when a new friends visits.

Durability;
After a month, one tube went flat and no longer holds air for more then a couple of hours.

20864,4111,870,"This car is a big hit with my 16 month old daughter.  She is able to open the door, get in, and then close the door herself. This is mainly her source of entertainment, however, she has managed to go backwards in the car and she thinks that is quite fun.  I imagine she will get better and better at powering the car with her feet.

I typically stray from pink/purple things that look obviously girly (I try to stick with gender neutral things in case later children are of a different gender), but for some reason, this particular Princess car was much less expensive than the gender neutral options.  It's really cute, but might be limiting in terms of what child may want to ride in it.

Compared to other things we have had to assemble, this wasn't too bad.  The directions were decent, although it was lacking an overall parts-list at the beginning. We weren't immediately able to tell if we were missing any pieces (thankfully we weren't.)

I am docking 1 star for the way it came packaged. The roof support pieces were taped together with clear duck tape. The two white pieces were taped together and then the two light pink pieces were taped together.  It was really hard to pull the tape off, and there was a lot of sticky residue left behind. It was ugly looking and annoying to constantly get your fingers stuck when touching the pieces. I had to spend a good 30 minutes to remove this residue. I would have been quite annoyed if this was a gift to someone.  I'm not sure if this is the standard way it comes packaged, or we received a returned one that someone else had taped up. Regardless of the reason, it was very annoying.

One other thing to note: the removable floor piece is pictured as light blue, but ours is black.",1529971200,4,car big hit 16 month old daughter abl open door get close door mainli sourc entertain howev manag go backward car think quit fun imagin get better better power car foot typic stray pinkpurpl thing look obvious girli tri stick gender neutral thing case later child differ gender reason particular princess car much le expens gender neutral option realli cute might limit term child may want ride compar thing assembl wasnt bad direct decent although lack overal partslist begin werent immedi abl tell miss piec thank werent dock 1 star way came packag roof support piec tape togeth clear duck tape two white piec tape togeth two light pink piec tape togeth realli hard pull tape lot sticki residu left behind ugli look annoy constantli get finger stuck touch piec spend good 30 minut remov residu would quit annoy gift someon im sure standard way come packag receiv return one someon el tape regardless reason

Amending my review because the seller went above and beyond with their excellent customer service!!

I initially purchased this because although some of the photos don't show a connected pen tool, the seller assured other customers who asked about this that the doodle pad now had a connected pen. I purchased this item with the presumption that the pen tool would be attached, but sadly it was not. My son is only 18 months and does not have the dexterity nor the patience to put the pen back in the housing properly after use. This in mind, I sadly had to return it for a different model. I did appreciate both the large size of the pad and the neat multi-colored background. It also wiped efficiently/cleanly with the slider tool. It doesn't seem terribly durable, but if you have a kid who doesn't step on/throw their possessions, I'm sure you'll be fine!

20918,1012,3712,"This is a interesting concept for a toy. You get ten numbers and download some apps that allow you to play games with them on your ipad (or other compatible device). My son is just under three, so although I downloaded the 1-10 app and the 1-100 app, we've been using mainly the 1-10 app. From my adult perspective, I think these are pretty cool. The numbers are solid wood and colorful. The screen recognizes them pretty much all the time (though if you put the number on sideways or upside down, it might register a different number (this is great with the 6 and the 9, but if you put the 7 upside down it recognizes a 2 and if the 8 is upside down it thinks it's a 3.) The apps have different ""games"" you can play. They are pretty simple--generally just asking you to identify the number. There is also a ""freestyle"" mode that lets the child just put whatever number they want on the screen and the ipad will say what it is or put up the correct number of dots or solve the equation depending on which game you are in.

I was pretty excited to play with this with my son, who knows his numbers up to twenty pretty well. He was really into the numbers themselves, but quickly lost interest in the app and the games. I've tried a couple times and he always loses interest (actually he never really gets interest in the game would be a more accurate description.) He really likes the numbers themselves and so we play with them sometimes but that is leaving 95% of what they are supposed to do on the table. The games int eh 1-10 app do seem pretty boring to me. They aren't very creative or anything. I haven't really checked out the other number games yet and I'm hoping my son will get more interested in using the numbers as intended, but for now I guess we'll just keep playing with them offline.

ETA: Okay, so four days later he is really into this game all of a sudden. It doesn't hold his interest for a super long time but all of a sudden after not being interested in it at all he is super into it. Go figure.

21061,1012,3881,"These are really cool! My son is almost 3 (will be three in 1.5 months) so he is technically young for these (and the apps with the letters are a bit more advanced than the ones made for the numbers) but he is really enjoying them so far. The letters themselves are wooden and well made shaped like the letter and brightly colored in various colors.  Each letter has three tabs on the back, which I assume are the sensors to make the ipad and app recognize the letter.

There are three free apps that come with the app, each for a specific age range. Since my son is so young, we've only used Vocabubble, which is a a letter recognition/vocabulary building game. I feel any review of this product should include a review of the app since you can't use the letters without them. The Vocabubble app is fun. You put the correct letter on the letter on the screen and then a the letter bursts and pictures pops out. You touch the letter to the picture and the app with zoom in on the picture, say the word, and spell it. I will ask my son to identify the pictures before putting the letter on it. He really likes the pictures and enjoys playing the game a lot. My one criticism is that some of the words they choose are a little advanced. For example, we were playing with the letter D when a camel popped up. He said camel, but I knew they weren't going for ""camel"" because the word had to start with a D. I figured it was Dromedary, which it was, but that's a bit much for a 3 year old. Also under G they use the word ""gnu"" which starts with a silent G. That's a terrible word for teaching beginning readers. There are other odd words, though those two are the ones that stand out to me. I like my son to be exposed to new and advanced words but Dromedary?

21184,192,176,"My daughter is 4 and enjoys working on the various frames. Some holes are tiny and are easily overfilled. They are actually very forgiving when kids overkill the frames. As the adult, mine looked the best when it was wet but the kids' messier ones actually looked brighter and had more colour when they dried. At 1st glance, the pink tube looks like it is a pastel pink but don't judge too soon, the glitter will show up when dried. I wished they had bigger tubes for the green pink and orange. Kids naturally love the brighter colours and those get used more.

If you don't want to work on the suncatchers or had use them all up, it is amazing how simple it is to make more patterns with the clear sheet and templates. Use the black glue, draw out a shape and let it dry.  Your child can fill it it and once it is dried, u can peel it off and stick it on a window like a decal.

Good price as it goes a long way.

Other cool features include the gate (this takes a little bit of strength to raise), the roller in the car wash, and the gas pump which is like a shoe lace and really helps kids with their fine motor skills.

You can reorder block delivery timing so you get more bonuses than your opponent on a given shipment.  You could even leave you opponent with no play other than to move your block(s) to a site and score points for you. On top of that this game is really pleasant and nice to look at.

21539,4250,3480,"I just cannot get over how much I love The Broken Tokens products. I previously reviewed their custom insert for the board game Terraforming Mars and gave is a glowing review. Basically the same can be said for their mini Dice Tower.

This little thing is just incredible. It comes unassembled and you really need to take care when putting it together as the pieces fit extremely snug so you don't want to accidentally break a piece trying to put them together. A small xacto-knife works wonders here to trim the edge a little. However I successfully got all the pieces put together without doing that and took a rubber mallet to make sure the pieces were perfectly fit together. It won't take you long to put this one together, took me about 15- 20 minutes and the instructions are crystal clear what parts go together.

I love the smell of the wood on these products and the engravings on them to make it look like a little castle are perfect. I also love the sound the dice make when clanking down the tower to come out in the bottom tray, its very satisfying. Once you are done using the tower you can fold the tower portion up into the base tray and it becomes super portable (very portable already as small as it is). The thing stands close to 5 inches tall.

Anyway Ive tried rolling different kinds of dice down it and it rolls them all perfectly with nothing getting stuck or jammed up in it. Plus with the tray it sits in you don't have to worry about an errant die flying off the table any longer! I honestly cannot think of a single downside to this great product. If you play a lot of games that include dice, this is a must purchase!

UPDATE 7/25/18 -- So after many, many plays with this ( I literally use it every single time I play a game with dice) I have found that I don't use the base it comes with at all anymore. I've found that the lip is just a little too tall which makes it hard to see the dice depending on where you have it sat on the table. Plus it's kinda small so reaching in to grab dice is more difficult that I would like. However just using the tower is still amazing and works just fine like that.",1531094400,5,cannot get much love broken token product previous review custom insert board game terraform mar gave glow review basic said mini dice tower littl thing incred come unassembl realli need take care put togeth piec fit extrem snug dont want accident break piec tri put togeth small xactoknif work wonder trim edg littl howev success got piec put togeth without took rubber mallet make sure piec perfectli fit togeth wont take long put one togeth took 15 20 minut instruct crystal clear part go togeth love smell wood product engrav make look like littl castl perfect also love sound dice make clank tower come bottom tray satisfi done use tower fold tower portion base tray becom super portabl portabl alreadi small thing stand close 5 inch tall anyway ive tri roll differ kind dice roll perfectli noth get stuck jam plu tray sit dont worri errant die fli tabl longer honestli cannot think singl downsid great product play lot game

I just cut the slide out.  Now there's a puncture on the side of the pool (this was my fault, had it too close to a bougainvillea)  but patch is holding it together.  We'll see how much longer we can go with it.  Absolutely enormous play pool and has been lots of fun.

His cape and skirt-tunic thingy are different types of cloth to add an effect. He has dual lightsabers, and you could get 2 hands on one lightsaber. His cowl and hood are made out of plastic, but the folds are represented amazingly. His head looks awesome. The red sash under his belt is made out of a semi-bendable plastic. The lightsaber handles have amazing detail and texture. The actual blades are nice and sturdy too. His feet, calves and knee area are covered with a cool looking platinum silver color. His thighs are dark black pants. His belt where the sash hangs from is a little loose, and made out of plastic. Again, the folds are incredibly well reflected. His chest area has some plastic, but it adds to the aesthetic. The rest is a metallic color, tinted with some light burgundy. It looks really cool. The top half of his arm is made out of plastic with well reflected folds. Then it has the burgundy armor tint. Then his hand has some armor on top, and plastic within it. Articulation is decent. You could move the head a little bit to the side or up. You could move the arm in any direction, but super high is limited by the cowl, as is head articulation. There is elbow articulation, you could turn it in any direction. The hand articulation can turn and rotate. His chest could rotate to the sides and puff up a little. His foot could move in any direction, only slightly limited by the calves. Calve articulation is great, you could move it forward and back, and slightly to the side. General leg articulation is great, you could turn it to the sides, backwards and forward. The articulation is limited though by the skirt, so watch that. This is an amazing figure.

21662,6066,4386,"UPDATE on my original review - please don't waste your money!!!!
I switched this from 3 stars to 1. We got to use this for all of a week. When I reached in to pull the little drain plug to drain the water out (as you have to drain, clean, and refill frequently to keep the water and plastic safe and clean for use), the drain plug literally ripped away from the liner. This was not from any kind of yanking... I have been really gentle with this thing because of the fact that I assume its not that hardy, and I have been strict with my kids about only using floaties in it, I put multiple layers of padding on my deck before putting the pool on it and inflating it to make SURE the bottom lining wouldnt tear and everything was PERFECTLY smooth and level under it, etc. I also had stopped plugging up the overflow hole because I was worried about it warping (and I wasn't able to get it much deeper anyhow). If it had torn from ANY other spot than where you drain the water, I probably would have tried fixing it (again - I received NO patch kit with mine, but would have probably found or tried something suitable to repair it), but there is NO way to fix this. Its done. Considering that the DRAIN PLUG (something that HAS to be used frequently with this) ripped and tore away after 6-7 DAYS (this was third time draining it...so on the THIRD use of gently unplugging it...theres no other way to drain it) and we are handling it with darn near kid gloves, this is NOT worth buying. EPIC FAIL. Note: I am NOT talking about the overflow hole here...I am talking about the plug at the bottom of the liner that you have to pull to drain the water out. This is GARBAGE.
*********
Original review:
This pool is cute and ideal for smaller children. I wanted a pool for my youngest (who has severe special needs) to safely practiceholding his breath underwater and get more comfortable with starting to learn how to swim. I read about the hole that you can plug up to make the pool hold more water, so I duct taped it easily.

I am rating this only 3 stars because: 1) Mine did NOT come with a patch kit, nor any instructions, which makes me believe this was more or less an open box and/or used item and not new. The items were a bit dusty/dirty, the items clearly looked like they had been unfolded and tampered with and then refolded back into the box in an awkward manner,  there was no plastic overwrap, etc;; 2) The dimensions are way off, with vague wording as to how deep it actually is (its WAY more shallow than you would expect, even AFTER plugging up that hole).

I know people are saying 22-24 in water depth is about what you get, but when I measured mine when fully inflated to the max and filled with water all the way to the top (to where its almost overflowing) it is 16. Thats it. Again - this is AFTER I got duct tape and plugged that hole with it. If you don't plug that hole, you will NOT get 1 foot deep...more like 10.  Whoever is saying they are getting 22 of water is sorely mistaken and have not measured it. After reading all the reviews, I thought I could reasonably get 20+ in water depth, so I was super disappointed to only get well UNDER 1.5 feet in depth max. I have everything inflated appropriately and its on my deck, which is as flat as you can pretty much get. 16 is not much, except to get your feet/ankles wet, and very barely enough to sit in. I was irritated, because I was about to buy a 22 deep rectangular pool when I came across this one, which looked a lot more fun with the waterfall thingy, etc. I would have never bought this if their specifications were clearer (and unfortunately, reviewers - albeit with good intentions - were way overestimating the depth even when the hole is plugged). This was a really big bummer for us. My kids are a little older (ages 13 and 8...I mainly got it for my aforementioned special needs 8 year old, but the depth is way too shallow to enjoy much, even for him).

THE PROS: Despite the above, I do have to say that it is sturdy, I haven't encountered leaks, and it is reasonably spacious, as far as inflatable pools go. I used my shopvac to inflate it super fast (putting the hose on the exhaust end) within a couple minutes. The price is reasonable, and the waterfall thingy in the arch over the pool is cute and fun. For toddlers and kids under the age of say, 3-4, thiis would be ideal, cheap, and safe for some summer splashin fun. This is why I felt it deserved 3 stars, instead of 2. It IS a quality product for what you are paying for...its just very misrepresented on depth/dimensions.",1531353600,1,updat origin review plea dont wast money switch 3 star 1 got use week reach pull littl drain plug drain water drain clean refil frequent keep water plastic safe clean use drain plug liter rip away liner kind yank realli gentl thing fact assum hardi strict kid use floati put multipl layer pad deck put pool inflat make sure bottom line wouldnt tear everyth perfectli smooth level etc also stop plug overflow hole worri warp wasnt abl get much deeper anyhow torn spot drain water probabl would tri fix receiv patch kit mine would probabl found tri someth suitabl repair way fix done consid drain plug someth use frequent rip tore away 67 day third time drain itso third use gentli unplug itther way drain handl darn near kid glove worth buy epic fail note talk overflow hole herei talk plug

* I have been Super excited to get this picnic table with umbrella.
* I get to spend time with my 16-month-old granddaughter.  Her mommy, my daughter is a teacher, and I get to keep my granddaughter when shes working.
* Right now, she is working half time at the school. It is the middle of July, and it is hot.
* We live on a working farm, so we spend much time outside. I wanted to give her an independent space and also a shady place out of the sun.
* This table is top-of-the-line. The quality is the best Ive seen out of many of the last products I have purchased for her.
* I  Think every toddler needs one of these.
* The table comes in five snap together pieces. No tools required. The Umbrella comes in two pieces. Slip together and open. Thats it. That is how easy it is.
* I believe my video is a little over three minutes. It would have taken less time if I had not been explaining each step. Very cool.
* Literally speaking, very cool, the Umbrella truly provides shade. I took a photograph of the shade. Where the shade lands depends on the sun, but the umbrella is a working umbrella.
* This is much more than a picnic table. It is a place of independence. A place where children can explore creativity. A safe place out of the sun. It can even be a  dining area  for children at parties and gatherings.
* If I had more grandchildren, this age, I would buy everyone of them a table just like this.

21683,3750,3095,"For full disclosure, we own SIX of these 24-piece jigsaw floor puzzles by Petit Collage.  They are well made, high quality, great large size pieces, and are perfect as floor puzzles.  We use them with toddlers and pre-schoolers but could probably be used through first grade if desired.  The pieces are cardboard and paper so they are not meant to get wet, be chewed upon, etc.  Only use the puzzles with kids who have clean, dry hands and don't put the pieces in their mouths.

Overall, I suggest that toddlers start with Petit Collage's beginner puzzles then work up / scaffold up to these 24-piece floor puzzles.  The best 24-piece floor puzzle to start with is Our World (see reasoning at end of review).

Use:  With younger kids or students with learning delays, I start with separating the edge pieces from the internal pieces.  I then have the child work on putting the edges together, focusing on colors or objects that would be in common.  Grouping similar colors or objects together usually enables a faster matching process.  Then I give the child the inside puzzle pieces to finish the puzzle.  They can be matched to the edge-piece frame by looking again for similar colors and objects.  I often have to remind kids that objects should be upright not upside down.  Once a child has mastered this two-step process (edges then internal), its time to let the child separate the edge pieces for themselves to complete the puzzle.  At first the parent or teacher may need to be present to remind that edge pieces have 1-2 flat sides and correcting as needed.  The parent/teacher may also need to remind the child to make the edge frame first then do the internal pieces.  Once a child has mastered completing a puzzle from start to finish with your monitoring, it is time to let them do the puzzle on their own.  The child may go against the edge then internal structure, but that is ok as long as the puzzle is getting done (I mean there is more than one way to do a jigsaw puzzle right).  BTW - older children or extremely able children, they will not need this degree of scaffolding - you probably could just hand them the box and let them figure it out through problem solving.  The very young or challenged may not have the problem solving skills yet to tackle a puzzle on their own - so you need to teach them HOW to problem solve and useful strategies before they can do it on their own.

The six puzzles we own are: Construction Site, Our World, USA map, Wild Rainforest, Enchanted Forest, and Farm.  Here are some specs on each of them.

1. Our World floor puzzle is color coded by continent, which divides the puzzle into separate color areas.  This makes it much easier for three year olds to place the jigsaw pieces.  The puzzle also enforces learning of the continents, though Greenland being a different color than the rest of North America might confuse some kids.  I highly recommend that you start with this puzzle before moving onto the harder ones.

2. Construction Site has silver, shiny, metallic areas which make the objects pop.  My three year old loved that detail.

3&4. Both Wild rainforest and Enchanted forest were the hardest for three year olds to do because there is a lot more going on.. and a lot of similar colors.  The kids were really motivated by the images in the puzzles, so they did complete the challenge.

5. The Map of the USA is educational and a tad harder than the Our World puzzle.  This is because the colors are more pop corned all over the place (so its harder to tell where pieces go unless you already know the states and what they look like.)  Start with learning the continents and the Our World puzzle, then work to doing the USA map puzzle.

6.  The Farm puzzle was overall the least interesting of the puzzles we purchased (at least to toddlers).  They wanted to put the puzzle together, but once made, they just wanted to put it away - whereas they begged to leave out the other puzzles so they could look at for a while.  It is still a wonderful puzzle, it is just that the images were not as engaging/exciting as the other puzzles we have.",1531440000,5,full disclosur six 24piec jigsaw floor puzzl petit collag well made high qualiti great larg size piec perfect floor puzzl use toddler preschool could probabl use first grade desir piec cardboard paper meant get wet chew upon etc use puzzl kid clean dri hand dont put piec mouth overal suggest toddler start petit collag beginn puzzl work scaffold 24piec floor puzzl best 24piec floor puzzl start world see reason end review use younger kid student learn delay start separ edg piec intern piec child work put edg togeth focus color object would common group similar color object togeth usual enabl faster match process give child insid puzzl piec finish puzzl match edgepiec frame look similar color object often remind kid object upright upsid child master twostep process edg intern time let child separ edg piec complet puzzl first parent teacher may need present remind edg piec 12 flat side correct need parentteach may also need remind child make edg frame first intern piec child master complet puzzl start

They, in fact, like this doll very much. We gave them those animatronic expensive dolls for Christmas that I thought they would go nuts for but so far they like these better.

As a mom this is a doll that I asked they use upstairs in their playroom because the crying is a bit loud and goes on and on. I would be safe to say that most adults would probably call it ear numbing annoying. I feel that way about most loud repetitive toys anyway but I don't have to play with it and it can be relegated to an upstairs room and I don't have to hear it very loudly. You may want to get one of their old pacifier holders that keep the pacifier clipped onto the dolls clothes handy. It saves time and tears looking for that pink thing.

21810,2131,1209,"The Petit Collage Pop Out Modern Birds set is fantastic. I let my oldest daughter ( age 10) put this together and she enjoyed doing it so much she told me she'd like other pop out sets from Petit Collage.

What we first noticed about this set were the bright and cheerful colors. The pieces are not just colored nicely but there are interesting patterns on the flowers, birds, and grass as well. The birds and flowers are lovely for decoration but also sturdy enough for play.

 My daughter told me this set was very easy to put together. There were four 5"" x 7"" punch out sheets. Each has numbers on the parts. In following the number sequence putting these together was a breeze. These aren't too big or too little as the playset goes up to 8 inches in height as advertised.

I like that that both sides are printed so we can have these turned any which a way and not have to worry about not seeing the pattern. I don't see these wearing out anytime soon. The sturdy cardboard is exceptional in quality. The thickness reminds me of that of someone of my husband's higher end board games pieces.

If you are done with playing with these or even having them as decor you could easily take them back apart and store them for later use or to pass along to someone else. However, if you are ready to let them go they can be recycled worry-free since they are made from recycled paper, non-toxic ink.

This is a wonderful earth-conscious product that looks pretty, is fun to play with, and a lovely way to boost puzzle solving skills. It's easy enough for a young child to put together with help and an older child to put together on their own.

21856,2551,4453,"I was able to give a year and a half old girl two of the dolls in the Cry Babies Girls collection and she instantly elevated both of them to favorite toy status. The three of them have now become an inseparable trio. They sleep together, they move around the house together (she is too small to carry both of them, so she carries one to where she wants to go and then she goes back for the other). They sort of eat together, with the dolls sitting on a chair by the table. She puts the pair of them on a little cart and pushes them around as if they were in a stroller. They all three ride together in the back seat of a car. The dolls are adorable, with tiny round mouths into which girls can put a pacifier and gigantic eyes. It is easy to see why even ery little girls can love them. They are cute and they need to be comforted. And the toys are great in helping to encourage compassion for the most vulnerable. I know that there are an absolutely uncountable number of dolls on the market for very young girls, but this line is just about as strong as I've seen. If you are looking for a perfect doll for a young girl, I think this would be beyond perfect. Young boys and girls are very different in many ways. Boys like stuff, things. Most go through a progression that you see from one boy to another: Thomas to Lightning McQueen to Spider-Man or other superheroes, later adding something like Star Wars or dinosaurs.

The tears flow out rapidly. So you're talking about the doll and its clothes, plus your child and her clothes and anything else around getting all wet. The doll is gonna have wet clothes until it dries. That means it's going to get dirtier faster. And in this case it's a white furry outfit on the doll, so just think about that. Its not a slow drip or trickle. The tears run down her face continuously, so even a few seconds gets her outfit at least a little wet. Of course you can have a bib or burp rag etc to dry her eyes, but let's face it, with little kids the mess is inevitable.

She IS cute. The crying is not an annoying cry. The cooing is not annoying. They used real baby sounds and picked one that won't drive everyone crazy.

She does work exactly as described. Pull her hood down, twist off the cap in the back of her head and fill it with water, replace the cap and hood. When she has the pacifier in her mouth she makes little happy baby sounds. Take the pacifier out and she cries and starts the waterworks. Oddly enough, if she is laying down with the pacifier out, she doesnt cry. Not sure if that is intended or not.

21931,596,1614,"This is a fantastic LEGO set. Please note, this set is now retired from LEGO, so you will most likely struggle to find it for retail price ($49.99). Having said that, if you're able to find this LEGO set for a price that is at or slightly above retail price, you may want to consider making the purchase.

This set comes with four LEGO minifigs (a pilot, a chauffeur, an airport worker, and lastly, a passenger), all of which look fantastic. I particularly like the passenger because of the torso piece and the pilot because he's wearing some cool shades. There's only space in the limousine for two (one driver and one passenger)... I'm not sure how LEGO could have added more space, but a limousine that can only hold one passenger seems limited. Otherwise, I really like the detail on the inside of the limousine and think the final completed build looks great.

The airplane has space for a pilot and three passengers, so hopefully you've got a few extra LEGO minifigs that you can borrow to help fill up your airplane. The coloring on the airplane looks great and it's a pretty solid build, so that means it should hold up well to lots of flying around the house.

Overall, I like this set and think you'll be pleased if you're able to find this set for a decent price. There are quite a few larger LEGO bricks in this set, so that is an added bonus because that means you can build a wide array of secondary builds using these less common LEGO bricks. Perhaps most importantly, there's a high level of playability with this LEGO set and that is one of the most important factors when considering which LEGO sets to purchase.

Hopefully you found this review helpful. If so, please let me know. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. Also, be sure to check out my other LEGO reviews on Amazon.

21969,619,4446,"This is our second Club Petz plush, after having tried out a talking parrot that my kids really enjoyed. Bam Bam is a rotund hamster who really reminds me of the cartoonish gopher from Caddyshack more than an actual hamster. In a way, it's something of an old fashioned toy, as I can vividly remember vibrating critter dolls as far back as the 1980s that would scoot and bounce along a table. Those, however, mostly just hummed as their internal motors went to work on the vibration. Bam Bam, of the other hand, at least makes noises that seem to be as fun for children as they are annoying for adults.

My daughters enjoyed playing with Bam Bam, at least for a while. They unfortunately enjoyed using it to freak out our pets more than anything else, but together, they had a good time tossing him back and forth like a furry, noisy ball. That said, the shaking gimmick wears off after a while. Bam Bam is not what I would consider a cuddly plush, certainly not one that my daughter would ask to sleep with at night. It's a mild occasional distraction, and I honestly wonder if this would not be marketed better as a pet toy. Still, my daughters enjoyed it even if their interest was relatively short-lived. Bam Bam appears to be well made, and considering that he is not getting nearly as much attention now as he did when he arrived a week ago, I suspect that his batteries will last awhile.",1532217600,4,second club petz plush tri talk parrot kid realli enjoy bam bam rotund hamster realli remind cartoonish gopher caddyshack actual hamster way someth old fashion toy vividli rememb vibrat critter doll far back 1980 would scoot bounc along tabl howev mostli hum intern motor went work vibrat bam bam hand least make nois seem fun child annoy adult daughter enjoy play bam bam least unfortun enjoy use freak pet anyth el togeth good time toss back forth like furri noisi ball said shake gimmick wear bam bam would consid cuddli plush certainli one daughter would ask sleep night mild occasion distract honestli wonder would market better pet toy still daughter enjoy even interest rel shortliv bam bam appear well made consid get nearli much attent arriv week ago suspect batteri last awhil

21971,619,4453,"My two daughters love dolls probably more than any other toys, and they were thrilled to try out these Cry Babies. We ended up trying out all three characters and found that they are virtually identical apart from their outfit and hair color, of course. But as far as their operation and sounds, they are pretty much interchangeable. Having successfully raised two children past infant and toddler age, I do personally understand the appeal of a doll whose primary function is to cry and fuss and make things wet. However, I would much prefer to have these Cry Babies in our home than dolls who wet their diapers (although the premise here is pretty much the same). Setting up these dolls to work is relatively easy. It is recommended that you purchase distilled water, which is easily found at any grocery store, so as not to ruin the innards. Once filled, the doll functions pretty much as advertised. Tears drip consistently like a faucet (so I would recommend that the doll always remain on a towel), and it will easily soak its cute outfit if it cries long enough. Beyond that, it emits unfortunately realistic baby cries that delight my daughters while annoying me more than anything else. Still, they enjoy taking care of these, and it only gets a little out of control when all three Cry Babies are going off at the same time.

After a week or so of occasional play, I notice that my youngest has really taken to caring for her doll. She seems eager to comfort it, albeit after deliberately taking away her pacifier to trigger her crying and tears. In this way, I suppose this is a useful toy in helping her understand basic kindness and nurturing. My eldest seems to recognize that this is a mere doll, so her enjoyment comes from making the doll ""come to life"" with sounds and tears. I suppose reactions will vary, but overall, even though I am personally not a huge fan of these as a parent, I cannot deny that my daughters do like these and are thrilled to have all three in the series. They are cute looking in their own way, with large heads (to accommodate the water container) and oversized eyes.

Setting up these dolls to work is relatively easy. It is recommended that you purchase distilled water, which is easily found at any grocery store, so as not to ruin the innards. Once filled, the doll functions pretty much as advertised. Tears drip consistently like a faucet (so I would recommend that the doll always remain on a towel), and it will easily soak its cute outfit if it cries long enough. Beyond that, it emits unfortunately realistic baby cries that delight my daughters while annoying me more than anything else. Still, they enjoy taking care of these, and it only gets a little out of control when all three Cry Babies are going off at the same time.

After a week or so of occasional play, I notice that my youngest has really taken to caring for her doll. She seems eager to comfort it, albeit after deliberately taking away her pacifier to trigger her crying and tears. In this way, I suppose this is a useful toy in helping her understand basic kindness and nurturing. My eldest seems to recognize that this is a mere doll, so her enjoyment comes from making the doll ""come to life"" with sounds and tears. I suppose reactions will vary, but overall, even though I am personally not a huge fan of these as a parent, I cannot deny that my daughters do like these and are thrilled to have all three in the series. They are cute looking in their own way, with large heads (to accommodate the water container) and oversized eyes. The tiny holes for tears are hardly noticeable, so the crying comes as quite a surprise to someone seeing these in action for the first time. Overall, for what these are, they are sturdy and well executed toys. My daughters would enthusiastically recommend these.",1532217600,5,two daughter love doll probabl toy thrill tri cri babi end tri three charact found virtual ident apart outfit hair color cours far oper sound pretti much interchang success rais two child past infant toddler age person understand appeal doll whose primari function cri fuss make thing wet howev would much prefer cri babi home doll wet diaper although premis pretti much set doll work rel easi recommend purchas distil water easili found groceri store ruin innard fill doll function pretti much advertis tear drip consist like faucet would recommend doll alway remain towel easili soak cute outfit cri long enough beyond emit unfortun realist babi cri delight daughter annoy anyth el still enjoy take care get littl control three cri babi go time week occasion play notic youngest realli taken care doll seem eager comfort albeit deliber take away pacifi trigger cri tear way suppos use toy help understand basic kind nurtur eldest seem recogn

Right when this came,my grandchildren wanted to start playing with the waterfall and truck. I set this out on the porch and gave them a bucket of water to use with it. They loved filling the top of the waterfall and watching the different wheels and levers move as the water flowed down. We then moved this into the sand box and had just as much fun filling the dump truck and owl cup and watching the sand slowing slip through.

The toy is well made and stood up to both children dumping water and sand into it. Easy to spray down and clean. I can see this being a huge hit as we continue to play into the upcoming summer months. The dump truck is an added bonus and my grandson loves pushing it around the yard and sandbox.

22005,1030,4450,"My granddaughter has been asking for a baby doll that cries real tears, so we were looking forward to playing with Lala. Unfortunately, the doll fell short in holding my granddaughter's attention. She will spend all day carrying around dolls and playing with dolls but this one did not last very long or hold her attention nearly as much as some of her other baby dolls.

The doll has an abnormally large head compared to the rest of the body. The water basin is located on the back of the dolls head, under the hoodie. You fill the head with water, screw the lid on and close the tab then watch as the doll cries; insert the pacifier and the crying and tears stop. The doll has leaked tears for us every time we fill i,t but my granddaughter does not seem to mind that.

The pacifier takes some wiggle strength to get it all the way in and stop the tears. The pacifier is attached to the baby so that you don't lose it.  Thankfully when the doll is crying, it is pretty quiet and not an annoying sound to have in the house. That is a win in my book for the crying feature.

2) Once the clothes for the doll got wet (the hood, for example) they stayed wet for quite a while.
3) Of course my daughter loves making Lala cry quite a bit so she's gone through a ton of Kleenex. I mean the simulated crying is cute but quickly gets out of control in terms of how much water the doll releases.

My daughter played with her closely for the first two days but once I turned off the crying option and emptied the water tank, she quickly lost interest.

22013,249,1949,"The power wheels kawasaki lil' quad is a great toy for a toddler. You will want to make sure that your little one has enough flat space to drive around because the turning radius is extremely wide. You will need a very large space to make a complete circle. Also, there is no reverse button. You should not ride this near hills, slopes, pools, roads, cars, or anywhere else that could increase the chances of an accident. You should also note that even if the ""go"" button is not being pressed the quad can reach high speeds if on a steep incline.  It comes with a rechargeable 6v 4Ah battery and charging cord that is to be plugged into a wall outlet (not a ceiling outlet!). Before using for the first time the battery must be charged for 18 hours, and 14 hours after each use. You are warned not to leave the battery charging for longer than 30 hours or it may cause the battery to degrade. The biggest downside is that there is no light to denote the battery is charging or completely charged. You just have to assume it is charging and that the battery is completely charged after you unplug it. It requires about 10 minutes of assembly time (excluding the sticker time). The quad does not come with the stickers already placed, so you will need to place the stickers on yourself. You will need a philips head and a flat head screw driver, all other parts are included. The only problem that I noted was one of the connections would not completely engage. There is a wire that is used to connect the battery one end and then the electrical supply from the ""go"" but on the handlebar. For some reason I could not get the handlebar connection to completely snap into place. Even though it did not completely connect it was enough for everything to work, so I left it as is. I was afraid to force it to completely connect and potentially breaking the plastic connector. It is listed to be for 12-36 months, and up to 40 pounds. Personally, I think 12 months is a little young to be riding this, especially if your child is on the small side and not completely steady on their feet when walking.

You have near term, end of round, and then end of game points (6 round). You need to play strategically, but your opponent can move your cubes/selections to a location you didn't want.

I've played with 4 and 2. With 4 players, it's pretty intense. With 2, I sometimes feel like I'm messing up the other person's game. You could definitely be ""mean spirited"" with this one.

I think the best way to play is to play it as ""what is best for me"" and set it up so that regardless of which ship is moved, you generally can benefit. Like a ""probability"".

Lastly, there are two sides to each ""place"" to put your stones. A-side is easier, B-side is harder. I appreciate the variety. And if needed in the long run, randomize them!

22056,4111,1501,"Our friends brought this to one of our Game Nights, and I have to admit that I was a little skeptical based on corny ""spy"" theme and the overall look of the packaging. Boy oh boy, was a I pleasantly surprised!! In a nutshell, I loved this game for its simplicity in pieces (no crazy board or obnoxious amount of accessories) and its requirement to creatively think.

The Rules:

1. Prepare the board. To do this, you simply lay out 25 white cards in a 5 by 5 grid.
2. Divide into two teams: red and blue. We had a group of 4, so we did 2 teams of 2. On each team, nominate one person to be the clue-giver. All remaining players are the guessers.
3. Let the clue-givers (one for each team) pick the one code-breaker card. This will essentially map the grid of white cards by assigning which cards belong to which team. For example, this means that the clue-giver on the red team is going to have to get the red team guesser(s) to guess the cards that are tagged as red.  In addition to noting which of the 25 white cards are red and which are blue, the code-breaker card also selects one that is black (the assassin).  If any guesser names the black card, the game is over. Untagged cards remain white. They are neutral, meaning that nothing happens if they are guessed.
4. Let the first team start. The clue-guesser must look at all of the cards that have been tagged to their team, and with one word, try to have the guesser(s) on their team say as many of the cards.  The guessers look to all 25 cards, and not knowing which belong to their team, which belong to the other team, and which is the black assassin, try to name only cards that belong to their team.

Example: The cards lips, lemon, mango, and ear are 4 cards on the 25 card grid. You are giving the clues and lips and lemon are tagged to your team. Mango and ear are tagged to the other team. This means you want to try to get your teammate(s) to say lemon and/or lips and NOT mango nor ear.  If you say ""flavor"" it is not enough to distinguish between lemon and mango. If say ""body part"" it is not enough to distinguish between ear and lips. But maybe the clue ""pucker"" could be enough?!

5. Continue in this manner, going back and forth, until one team identifies all of their cards. That team is the winner!

One thing I will note is that this game can move along rather slowly, because of its requirement to think. This means there can be a lot of downtime while you are waiting for the clue giver to come up with their clue. We were OK with this, but you might want to have some music or TV on in the background.",1532390400,5,friend brought one game night admit littl skeptic base corni spi theme overal look packag boy oh boy pleasantli surpris nutshel love game simplic piec crazi board obnoxi amount accessori requir creativ think rule 1 prepar board simpli lay 25 white card 5 5 grid 2 divid two team red blue group 4 2 team 2 team nomin one person cluegiv remain player guesser 3 let cluegiv one team pick one codebreak card essenti map grid white card assign card belong team exampl mean cluegiv red team go get red team guesser guess card tag red addit note 25 white card red blue codebreak card also select one black assassin guesser name black card game untag card remain white neutral mean noth happen guess 4 let first team start clueguess must look card tag team one word tri guesser team say mani card guesser look 25 card know belong team belong team

22058,1332,605,"This is the second set of Melissa & Doug magnets that I've purchased -- the first was all animal magnets. I got these on Prime Day, so they were pretty inexpensive for being 52 magnets. However, I've only given my son (14 months old) the capital letters so far. The lowercase ones seem like they could be a little bit too small for him. I'm glad the box of magnets is divided up so all of the capital letters are in one little section, and the lowercase letters in another. That makes it easy to only give him the ones I want him to have.

The letters seem a little inconsistent. It's not a big deal, and it doesn't effect their use at all. It just seems like some of them are thicker than others, some a little smaller, etc. It's a little bit annoying to the eye. But the colors are fun and vibrant. The entire back of each letter is magnetic, so they stick readily and easily to the fridge or dishwasher, and they're raised enough so my son's little fingers can grab them easily and move them around. For now, he just likes to swat them all off of the dishwasher and leave them all over the floor, but hopefully soon he'll get the hang of them.",1532390400,4,second set melissa doug magnet ive purchas first anim magnet got prime day pretti inexpens 52 magnet howev ive given son 14 month old capit letter far lowercas one seem like could littl bit small im glad box magnet divid capit letter one littl section lowercas letter anoth make easi give one want letter seem littl inconsist big deal doesnt effect use seem like thicker other littl smaller etc littl bit annoy eye color fun vibrant entir back letter magnet stick readili easili fridg dishwash theyr rais enough son littl finger grab easili move around like swat dishwash leav floor hope soon hell get hang

22073,4111,1754,"Overall, a pretty good toy especially considering the price point!  My 17 month old daughter likes it, so how could I not review positively? I would recommend it for any Elmo-obsessed child.

The button to activate Elmo's voice is located in his chest. It is a big button and pretty easy to find, and I feel that is a definite plus since my daughter is able to do it herself. The doll is soft, but I wouldn't necessarily call it cuddly. The eyes are made of hard plastic, the body contains a hard voice/battery box, and the mouth is also hard and stuff. Hugging any of those parts is not comfortable, not to mention the fact that hugging could also trigger some talking/singing. (clearly not a toy for bed or naps)

I am giving 4 stars because I don't think the quality of the plush is the best. Nothing that my daughter cares about, but the seams on the shirt are uneven, the legs are really limp because they lack the appropriate amount of stuffing, and pieces of Elmo's fur can easily be pulled out.

When activated, Elmo will either sing the ABC song or say one of the below phrases:

- Oh Hello, Elmo wants to sing with you.
- Oh Hello, Wanna Sing with Elmo?
- Sing with Elmo! Then sings the ABC song
- Let's Sing!  Then sings the ABC Song
- Let's Sing the Alphabet! Then sings the ABC Song
- A is the first letter in Abby's name
- Elmo loves the letter E because E is the first letter in Elmo's name
- What's the first letter in your name?
- B is the first letter in Big Bird's name
- C is the first letter in Cookie Monster's name

After a few seconds of inactivity, Elmo will automatically say ""Thank you for singing with Elmo""

One other thing to note is that Elmo's shoes and clothing are not removable. I think this is a good thing because there are less pieces to get lost, but my daughter seems to get frustrated with this. She is recently into trying to put her shoes on and after identifying Elmo's shoes, she really wants to try to take them off.",1532476800,4,overal pretti good toy especi consid price point 17 month old daughter like could review posit would recommend elmoobsess child button activ elmo voic locat chest big button pretti easi find feel definit plu sinc daughter abl doll soft wouldnt necessarili call cuddli eye made hard plastic bodi contain hard voicebatteri box mouth also hard stuff hug part comfort mention fact hug could also trigger talkingsing clearli toy bed nap give 4 star dont think qualiti plush best noth daughter care seam shirt uneven leg realli limp lack appropri amount stuf piec elmo fur easili pull activ elmo either sing abc song say one phrase oh hello elmo want sing oh hello wanna sing elmo sing elmo sing abc song let sing sing abc song let sing alphabet sing abc song first letter abbi name elmo love letter e e first letter elmo name what first letter name b first letter big bird name c first letter cooki monster name second inact elmo automat say thank sing

I always wanted one when I was a kid, but we didn't have space for it. I am super glad to be able to have this one for my kids. I was apprehensive about assembling this thing to be honest. I am good at furniture and kids toys, but have no experience with electrical toys as complicated as this one. I did this myself and it only took me about an hour. I made a few mistakes and took my time with it. It wasn't that hard, really. The worst part was attaching the steering column bar. You have to be able to lift-up the whole car for a little bit. It is heavy, but manageable. The only issues I had were my own. I almost put the grill on backwards, and the stickers were a bit annoying so I did what I wanted with them. No fault of the car, just my own stupidity reading the instructions wrong.

Once you have it assembled, you have to charge the battery for 18 hours. Super annoying. I charged it before assembling it and then gave it to the kids the next day. They LOVE it!!! My 5 year old is learning how to drive it quickly. It is easy for her to use. I wish there was a wall between the passenger area and the gas pedal though. My 3 year old keeps reaching over and pressing the pedal when her sister is driving. I stay with them the whole time so they don't drive into my car or something. It easily fits 2 kids. Plenty of space.

This thing has two speeds as well as reverse. There is a block on the upper speed to keep the younger kids slower. It is a screw in the shifter that you can remove to allow them to go faster. The radio really works! You can search through the stations and they come in pretty well too. The lights in the back work as well. They automatically turn off after a few minutes if you forget to. There is a lot to like about this thing. My kids want to ride it literally every day. I posted a video of them riding it to show it in action. It works much better on pavement than grass, but it really does well. My lawn is like a wetland, which makes it even more impressive that this thing can drive on it.",1532822400,5,div idvideoblockr3jiwmde5z3j29 classasect aspacingsmal aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesib1jxncslyqsmp4 classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesib1ijqe72b08spng classvideoslateimgurlnbspthi first power wheel ever experi alway want one kid didnt space super glad abl one kid apprehens assembl thing honest good furnitur kid toy experi electr toy complic one took hour made mistak took time wasnt hard realli worst part attach steer column bar abl liftup whole car littl bit heavi manag issu almost put grill backward sticker bit annoy want fault car stupid read instruct wrong assembl charg batteri 18 hour super annoy charg assembl gave kid next day love 5 year old learn drive quickli easi use wish wall passeng area ga pedal though 3 year old keep reach press pedal sister drive stay whole time dont drive car someth easili fit 2 kid plenti space thing two speed well

In particular the card drafting mechanic is well implemented. As such I think it makes for a good gateway game and have used it a few separate times to introduce newbies to the hobby and even purchased another copy for my nephews because they enjoyed it so much.

22238,2007,4373,"I love this set for my 3 year old. She enjoys playing in the sand whenever we go to the beach or from a sand box.

Lets go over each part of this bucket set.

The big sand \water pail is excellent. Looks flimsy but feels substantial. Smooth surface without any cracks or bumps from inferior molds. Blue and Orange are colors of Blippi - her current favorite real life character on Youtube.

The water can looks like something out of Aladdin - definitely an ancient  middle-eastern flair to it. My daughter was initially spooked by the thing, but now she doesnt care for it much.

I really have no use for yellow green sieve. Maybe making impressions in the sand? It fits on the bucket but really I don't know what purpose it could serve when you use in a sand box or on a white sandy beach ;)  rather than just be a lid.

The shovel and the rake are cute. The rake especially since its tines resemble robot-fingers.

Castle pieces are extremely randomId rather they make them smaller and give me more castle pieces. Like towers or minarets.

The iron is for shaping and smoothingbut she is too young to pay attention to smoothing her creations i guess.

22304,4544,889,"4 1/2 year old son was thrilled to get this, Hot Wheels are his current toy of preference for this month and this definitely delivers on the fun. Lots of connection points for track seal the deal and make this otherwise basic toy into something my son incorporates into his larger Hot Wheels world  aka the huge track set up currently happening in his play room  so if the kiddo you're buying this for loves Hot Wheels and has track pieces/connectors of their own (none are included here) and possibly at least one other Hot Wheels toy they can connect this to, theyll love it!

As far as a car garage goes, this is sorta simple, not the sturdiest toy in the world, smaller than you might expect and does take a little adult assembly. But its also only $25! Normally an actual brand name Hot Wheels garage like this one is will  go for over $150 easily so if you have that kind of money and want to spend it on a Hot Wheels garage than you can expect a much bigger, much more interactive toy. But for the low price, this is an awesome set. Youve still got all the basic pieces youd want - a working elevator for the cars, sliding track that the cars can launch down, a splitter at the end to allow your kiddo to decide which track the car will take, some parking spots etc.

All in all, for the cheapest Hot Wheels brand car garage on the market, its a great buy.

22330,2872,4488,"Judging from previous, older reviews, I'm assuming this product was reworked and that's why it's going back through Vine.  I read all the reviews and the most common problem seemed to be her tipping over frequently.

I'm not seeing any problems with balance at all.  She falls maybe 20% of the time, but we do too when we roller skate.  I don't see that as any different.  I first tried her in my office and while I have a fair bit of open space, she still hit various parts of my desk in her movements and even then, most of the time she didn't fall over.

She works great on laminate.  We have a thick tile with wide grout lines in the kitchen (I hate it) and she did have a little difficulty with that.  We have several large low pile, tight weave rugs that she did fine on.  Our one thicker rug didn't cause her to fall but did hamper her movements to some extent.

Each foot needs 2 AA batteries.  Cover is screwed in.  There's a 3 position switch on one foot that controls it all.  Off, ""Try Me"" and On.  ""Try Me"" being the setting it comes on in the box so only the bow/voice works.

She does make a bit of mechanical noise when moving, but nothing untoward.  The ""song"" she sings is terrible.  I can't understand some of the words because it's unclear, but it's not catchy at all, and a bit arrhythmic.  That's me, though.  My kidlet thinks it's fun.

Her movement radius is about 3' or so.  Her shoe bows also light up when on.  It's got a choking hazard warning, but the black nose tip is the only thing I can see a child being able to get off with determined chewing.  Overall, we're just really pleased with her.

I will update if any durability issues pop up.

22365,4562,3881,"This is one of those ideas that seems really cool, but the execution on my end is so so. First, all of these interactive letters are PIECES. Now, if you're like me your house is swimming in toys with PIECES everywhere--some missing. I just can't see how in my situation with a 4 year old and his little 1 year old sister tyrant running around that we can keep these pieces together. As soon as one is lost you can't use it in the apps because the pieces have very specific bumps on the backside to let the app know which piece you're using.

The apps. So this comes with three free apps which we downloaded onto our iPad. I was actually less than impressed with the games and overall roll out of the app. The audio was annoying. There's this woman's voice that repeats sounds and letters in a sing song trill that gets old and irritating very fast. Also, the games were not very engaging or encouraging the children how to use the pieces. My 4 year old has Autism. He has no problem with other iPad games that engage with rewarding stimuli for getting things right. There's also the delay of searching around for the right piece that gets old for him. He knows the answer, but can't find the piece quick enough. These apps just didn't engage him with encouraging rewards so he lost interest quick.

For a mature, neurotypical child who loves letters this might be a better toy for you. For us, it was a great idea that just didn't execute as hoped.",1533254400,3,one idea seem realli cool execut end first interact letter piec your like hous swim toy piec everywheresom miss cant see situat 4 year old littl 1 year old sister tyrant run around keep piec togeth soon one lost cant use app piec specif bump backsid let app know piec your use app come three free app download onto ipad actual le impress game overal roll app audio annoy there woman voic repeat sound letter sing song trill get old irrit fast also game engag encourag child use piec 4 year old autism problem ipad game engag reward stimulus get thing right there also delay search around right piec get old know answer cant find piec quick enough app didnt engag encourag reward lost interest quick matur neurotyp child love letter might better toy u great idea didnt execut hope

22402,4309,1324,"Great toy. Easy to assemble and good quality. Instructions are easy to follow. Took me about 15 mins. Does not come with batteries.

Pros:
1) easy assembly
2) holds out sons attention span for about 30 mins
3) light weight and easy handling by toddler
4) easy storage- doesnt take up a lot of room
5) 3 different race tracks with inter changeable track section
6) easy system to understand for a 2.5 year old

Cons (1 star deduction):
1) design flaws: if child feeds too many minis into the track it tends to creat a jam at the starting point and stop the track (easy fix: remove the minis)
2) design flaw: it also knocks off the minis if jammed
3) the interchangeably track part tends to create a jam if not lined up exactly and one has to be quick. A child might not have enough agility to be quick changing the track creating a jam if too many minis on the track.

No toy is perfect. With that said our son loves it and even we enjoy playing with it. That is all that counts and seeing the joy on his face is all this needs. It so worth purchasing this.

Once the kids are placed on top of the planes, they are unable to move themselves because they're high out of the water and in a straddle position, so they just sit and squirt the gun at whatever's in front of them. My rough-and-tumble swimmers prefer the traditional raft-like floats that they can be more active on.

But if your little ones enjoy ride-on toys and would be content with the awesome water gun, then this is a good buy! I also think this might be better for older kids who are bigger and can move the planes around on their own.

In terms of fun factor for our family, I wouldn't mark this ride-on so high.

I love the fact that the wide tires are perfect for that our driveway and grass.  I'm also impressed with the low-rider base; works perfectly for our little guy when he wants to get on and off all by himself!

Since he's such a little guy and this is his first battery operated vehicle, I really appreciate that it can only go forward. Now, this does cause some problems when he runs into our hedge, we need to go over and move it for him.  But, I really think it is better for him. I also like the fact that it can only go 2 mph. Just the right speed for our little one.

The maximum cruising speed of this Lil Quad vehicle is 2 miles per hour  fast enough to be fun, but slow enough for safety. And to keep it simple, it only goes forward. All kids have to do to make it go is push a button, and they're cruising all on their own!

Now for the added features:
(1) Cup holder. He thinks he's such a big guy when he goes out and places his water bottle in the cup holder. Just like daddy!
(2) Easy push-button operation.  All he has to do is push the button and he's off!
(3) Easy low rider.  Perfect size for our little guy. He can easily get on and off the quad without any help.

Summary:
(1) Cool Kawasaki graphics
(2) Toddler-friendly features
(3) 2.5 mph max. forward only

I'm happy to play any game that she actually wants to play (and with me!), and so we end up playing this a lot. It's a decent, family-friendly game if you ignore the part about kittens exploding.
The premise of the game is simple: avoid the exploding kitten cards. You can only prevent yourself from losing if you have a defuse card, so you want to amass as many of those cards as possible, typically by stealing them from other players.

A few years ago, the bRiDe came to an arrangement with me on my action figure collecting. I would cut way down to a couple particular interests, and she wouldnt take me to the cleaners in divorce. Having shared that, my experience has been that the Diamond Select brand has little competition in quality detail & accessories vs. selling price. These Ghostbusters releases do not disappoint.

However, this review is not for the figure, but for the assembled rooftop diorama. And, you better have some serious shelf space, as this monstrosity takes up space equivalent to 15.75 (H) x 18.5 (W) x 33.75 (L). The grey plastic sections assemble fairly smooth, with only the upper lintel section giving me minor grief. These pieces don't lock together, so you can disassemble for storage. But its dry plastic on plastic, so be gentle.

Below, youll find the individual wave releases along with each figures corresponding accessorized part(s). Ive done my best to distinguish left from right sections. DST did not help matters by labeling some parts L or R then referring to them in the instructions oppositely. Kind of like, my right hand is on the left to someone facing me. So, referencing left or right below, it is from my vantage point facing the front of this structure.

Last thing, DST also was stingy with the instructions. Fifteen purchases awarded only three copies. You can find these online but the clarity can be rough, so below youll find the stepbystep as its printed on the instructions.

22549,5882,695,"I purchased this recently for my son, who had the smaller spinning version of the Fat Brain toy.  He's now a year and a half, so I wanted to get him something larger.  I love that this toy does not have a lot going on with it; it doesn't have blinking lights, sounds etc.  It's a simple toy, but it encourages motor skills and my son loves the immediate reward of seeing the discs spin after he manages to get them onto the pole.

My only complaint is that the base is not attached to the pole.  When it came I believe there was a rubber band around the bottom of the pole, which gave it a bit of a snugger fit on the base.  I removed the rubber band when I saw it because I really didn't think it was safe to leave it on.  The result is that the pole is constantly separating from the base.  I guess that could be part of the activity (put the pole in the base), but I really find it kind of annoying.  Unless the pole is sitting in the base sticking straight up, he won't try to play with it.

Besides this, the toy is really fantastic.

22604,2872,554,"The name of this company is ""Basic Fun"".  That's a good clue that this item isn't meant for serious players.  It's just your avg low end, ""quickie"" toy.  I made a couple of pix for size reference, since the listing didn't include one.

- The joystick is fairly loose.  It can be a little tricky getting the blocks to move a single space, but it can be done (we got the Tetris).
- All the buttons function as they should, no hesitation, and no missed contacts.
- By the pix you can see size, but it's pretty light.  It pretty much needs to be hand-held, though it looks like one could set it on a table top.
- Sound effects are definitely retro (and very close to original), and can be turned off.

While it says 8yrs +, I might go younger than that.  Today's kids seem to be pretty electronics-sophisticated early.

It's nothing special, but it's decent.

The clothes have light grey undertones and they look interesting on  a pale surface - it is very hard to see this figure on a black table, let's say. This is actually creepy, because only its hands can be seen if it is dark in the room.
The rags on its body are flexible and appear to be quite sturdy, so there won't be any problem if the figure falls off from the place it is stored. The eyes are sunken and the mouth is fanged. The position of the hands is  one which suggests that it may want to grab you, but the form of the opened mouth still makes me think it is about to sneeze, I don't know why. The head does not spin, but the neck is very beautifully made. The cloth over the Dementor's head feels harsh to the touch and it twists nicely on the shoulders.

22783,6268,1538,"If you have a child like mine, taking turns is a challenge, the idea of losing is mind melting, and patience is not yet a virtue.  Zingo is a great game to start using those skills at an early age.  While this game is mostly touted for teaching pre-reading skills, I have found that it is a great game for learning to take turns.  Learning to lose graciously is so not easy so this game is a great starter to ease into that.  I've found that the sting of losing hurts a little less when you allow everyone to cover their board, but also state, ""this person actually won the game since they covered the board first, but everyone finished.""

In Zingo there are yellow chips with various pictures, smile, shoe, cat, dog with the word written on the bottom.  There are 6 ""bingo"" cards with those various pictures on them as well.  One person slides the red chip holder forward and two chips slide out.  If you have one of those pictures on your board, shout out the word first and you get the chip to cover your board.  The first person to cover every picture wins the game.  The two sides are merely easy and more competitive.  You can choose to do regular bingo rules like four corners or X marks the spot.  Cleanup is easy because the chips all sit in the red holder.  Kids love the game because of the red slider and ability to use their outside voice inside, and adults love it because surprise!, you're learning!",1535155200,4,child like mine take turn challeng idea lose mind melt patienc yet virtu zingo great game start use skill earli age game mostli tout teach preread skill found great game learn take turn learn lose gracious easi game great starter ea ive found sting lose hurt littl le allow everyon cover board also state person actual game sinc cover board first everyon finish zingo yellow chip variou pictur smile shoe cat dog word written bottom 6 bingo card variou pictur well one person slide red chip holder forward two chip slide one pictur board shout word first get chip cover board first person cover everi pictur win game two side mere easi competit choos regular bingo rule like four corner x mark spot cleanup easi chip sit red holder kid love game red slider abil use outsid voic insid adult love surpris your learn

I found these foam swords to be the best and most economical option.  The decision was between these and blow-up swords, I read that most of the blow up swords arrived damaged not to mention that I would have to blow up 24 swords for the party guests.  From experience, sometimes foams swords fall apart from lots of sword fighting action; however, these held up throughout the entire party.  I once bought a really expensive foam sword ($15) from Williamsburg only for it to disintegrate by the end of the day from my son's average use.  These stood up to hours of sword fighting, sticking them in holes in the ground, and honestly everything under the sun during the party.

Or if you build these with super glue so none of the pieces come off. But if your kids are like mine, you no longer have a backhoe and a dumptruck, you have random pieces in the Lego box that will never again become anything resembling a truck. But you know your kids, so these might work great for you. These was an adorable truck set for about 13.5 minutes.

Seen in the 2016 reboot of Ghosbusters, and energized by Rowans hyperionization device, Mayhem is the aerial nasty that haunts the Stonebrook Theatre. First attacking Fernandothejanitor, then inhabiting a naked mannequin, it erupts in full gruesome glory to terrorize a heavy metal concert with fictional band Beasts of Mayhem. Later, once released it makes off with famous debunker Dr. Martin Heiss.

Measuring a whisker shy of 6.0 _ or 6.75 to the wingtips _ the main body of this pinktongued creature is made from brown semitranslucent plastic. (Wings are closer to amaranth red). Articulation is found at the neck (swivel), wings (hinged), shoulders & elbows (hingedswivel), wrists & hips (swivel).

Pressing the belly button activates a green light in the upper chest. Push it, light comes on. Let go, light goes off. This effect requires three AG13/LR44 batteries, accessed from the creatures back, and these button cells are included with this purchase. For my Diamond Select collection its a decent addition. But, for the grandchilds desire to handle some of this display, at the current $4.39 price, its perfect.

PS  Makes me think of the Dean Winters character who wreaks havoc in the Allstate Insurance TV commercials.",1537401600,4,classif class 3 vapor seen 2016 reboot ghosbust energ rowan hyperion devic mayhem aerial nasti haunt stonebrook theatr first attack fernandothejanitor inhabit nake mannequin erupt full gruesom glori terror heavi metal concert fiction band beast mayhem later releas make famou debunk dr martin heiss measur whisker shi 60 675 wingtip main bodi pinktongu creatur made brown semitransluc plastic wing closer amaranth red articul found neck swivel wing hing shoulder elbow hingedswivel wrist hip swivel press belli button activ green light upper chest push light come let go light goe effect requir three ag13lr44 batteri access creatur back button cell includ purchas diamond select collect decent addit grandchild desir handl display current 439 price perfect p make think dean winter charact wreak havoc allstat insur tv commerci
