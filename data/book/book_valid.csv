28533,2376,1173,"My Name is Venus Black starts with 13-year-old Venus committing a crime against her step-father. There is a lot of media attention surrounding the crime and her trial due to the nature of the incidents leading up to the crime and her youth. End result, she is sentenced to 6 years in a juvenile detention center. Shortly after she is imprisoned, her 7 year old special needs (likely autistic) brother, Leo, is kidnapped. The book alternates between the stories of this brother and sister, and the people who enter their lives, throughout.

When Venus is released at 19, she vows to start over, taking a new name. But the past won't let her go, and much to her chagrin, follows her. She struggles to come to terms with what that means for her moving forward. Trying to make a new life, while being pulled into dealing with old relationships is hard for her. Her main goal upon release is to find out what happened to her brother Leo - whether he is still alive, and/or what happened to him.

Coming from a definitely dysfunctional family, it is heart-warming to see Venus and Leo each begin to let others into their boxed off lives. As a result, they find relationships that lead them to grow and flourish. Family has many forms; it can be your birth family, or those who you find or who find you and want the best for you. My name is Venus Black addresses many of them.

It is extremely difficult to review this book without giving away spoilers, so I am being purposely vague. My apologies - I don't want to ruin your own read of this very good book!

Heather Lloyd is exceptional in creating full, rich, deep, understandable characters. It is that skill which propels this character-driven novel. If you're looking for a fast, suspenseful read, this isn't it. But if you love to feel as if you've entered the world of others, and watch their lives develop, this is a book for you.

I give this book 3.5 stars, only because the ending was a bit too perfect in my opinion.

Many thanks to NetGalley and Random House for allowing me to an e-copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

28535,855,2962,"I will admit that the title, and the instant connection that I found to Maya Angelous autobiographical I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings piqued my interest, but Im also intrigued by the differences and similarities in people all over the world.  Darznik used poems, letters, film and interview texts from Farrokhzads life to craft a story that feels as if it could be biographical, if freely drawing from her imagination.  An Iranian immigrant herself, Darzniks mother smuggled volumes of Farrokhzads poems out of the country, and the ties to home and a fascination with the woman was born: resulting in this novel, freely sharing poems and moments with us.

From the start, I saw the affinity the author had for the subject in the very present voice of Forugh, each moment is clearly presented with emotion and clarity that brings the moments to life for the reader: and the natural curiosity that one would expect of a young woman finding her way in the world, seeing and questioning the rules and imbalances, and finding the courage to continue to question where others simply submit.  Darznik managed, in varying degrees, the voice of the poet without overlaying a more western judgment to the moments, allowing the reactions to feel real and plausible.  By the authors admission, many of the events are imagined, as Farrokhzads family is thought to have destroyed most of her personal papers  a not uncommon reaction to a life that was constantly at odds with their own traditions, beliefs and quiet existence amidst the political tumult of the time.

In the short time that Forugh was on the earth, just 32 years, her time was spent learning, questioning and finally defining an existence that was full of possibility rather than restriction. The restrictions of tradition, of expected, of religion and political stricture: her choices were bold and daring, and uniquely dangerous. Full of questioning looks, family and societal censure and the refusal to remain in the background and mute, as was expected (and demanded) of women.  The inclusion of the poetry shows a growth and understanding of the world, the one she inhabited and the one she was working to create: the emotions and growth in understanding, viewpoint and strengthening of her voice are all clearly apparent.  Here is where there is often a slight disconnect  the real words of Forugh tend to show a maturity as the poetry is revealed that is often not reflected in the prose that is not of her words.  A small miss, that while apparent, only provided (for me) a sense of real tensions overriding her life and choices, often bringing these moments forward with a sense that feels less interior voice and more third person.  It was an interesting shift in the dynamic while reading, for sure, and one that often had me rereading a poem with a different eye.

Poet, documentary maker, feminist in a place that wasn't welcoming to any sort of dissent or individual voices raised to show flaws, discrepancies or limits, the story engages as it teaches: strength, courage, imagination and a desire to self-define a life, however short, by ones own views of what should be, not what is.  The strongest lesson here for me is not the struggle, nor the hurdles overcome but the true desire to be seen and loved as a complete person: female, curious, talented, intelligent and bold.  A wonderful introduction to a poet with a voice that spans the chasms of difference to show the similarities.

28544,3362,2070,"Gigantic 19th century Russian novels are, by now, an acquired taste - too long, ponderous, complicated, philosophical, with too many unpronounceable names and patronymics and place names, and on and on and on...for these times. Yet they top the lists of ""10 NOVELS YOU MUST READ BEFORE YOU DIE"" (I know: if they don't kill you first). And patient, persistent readers discover, by Gyorgi, that these books are soap operas!  Loaded with archetypal heroes and villains, fascinating secondary characters, and filled with vivid lives as they're lived out.

And here, a contender for the greatest of them all, is the story of the ill-fated Karamazov brothers - Dmitri, Ivan, Alexi - and their thoroughly sleezy, utterly unlikeable (except that he's hysterically amusing) father, Fyodor Pavlovich, together with the women who provide much of the story's dramatic tension: Agrafena Alexandrovna Svetlova, known as Grushenka, a ""woman of loose morals"" who attracts the adoration of both Dmitri and his father, and her noble narrative counterpoint, Katerina Ivanovna Verkhovtseva, jilted by Dmitri, loved by Ivan, and saintly...until she's not.

The complex tale Dostoyevsky weaves is at once majestic, timeless, profound - pick a superlative. (Don't say ""excessively slow"" or ""uncommonly boring."" The big Russians have their detractors.) And if you're disinclined to read the entire 700+ pages (in the very small font Dover Thrift edition I read), you ought not wait to read the justly famous chapter, ""The Grand Inquisitor,"" as a stand-alone that continues to astound with its tightening, Bolero-like grip, provocative thesis, and startling conclusion. (In other words, don't wait 50 years for ""The Grand Inquisitor,"" which I read about as an undergraduate but never quite got to.)

Know, however, that every word Dostoyevsky sets down is most assuredly *not* sacred. That is, although some readers may find his superabundant verbiage endearing - I place.myself in this camp -  he's a ceaseless overwriter and a sometimes tedious over-observer. This in turn translates into punctilious overdescription...of locales, feelings, sensations, the behaviors of stray dogs and cats and other critters that wander in and out of scenes, and so on. (But I should qualify this, after all, as overwriting of a superior caliber.)

And, forgive me, I prefer to read fat Russian novels in the generally felicitous translations of Constance Garnett, who knew Tolstoy and wrote in the high style of late 19th-early 20th century English writers. I've read the criticisms of Garnett - nuances of individual authors' styles that melt into a single Garnett English, too many Anglicisms, too fast a worker.and thus getting nuance or details wrong - but the graceful accessibility of the prose and a fearless, yet sensibly assured management of the often Byzantine complexity of these books makes her an easy.choice over other translators. (Moreover, it's the public-domain aspect of Garnett's translations that make her a favorite of publishers like Dover, who pay no use rights, and audiobook producers. And while I'm at it, let me give a shout-out to the late, golden-throated, voice-shifting David Case, aka Frederick Davidson and other aliases, Mellifluous Narrator of the Big Russians Extraordinaire, another automatic choice.)

Please do not be put off by Dostoyevsky (or, for that matter, any of the great Russians). He may not be for every taste, but he has surely earned a place on your literary bucket list - as a storyteller, a close observer and perceptive psychologist, a precursor of existentialism, and a deeply religious writer who has made sense of Christianity - even to an atheist like me - and puts a warmly attractive face on it. There's an entire world here, a 19th Century, self-consciously self-referential Russian one you won't know and cannot imagine, that begs to be explored, and one in which you'll find the full range of human types - beginning with the thickly described Karamazovs themselves - and emotions that, despite vast cultural differences, hum with universal resonance.",1520380800,5,gigant 19th centuri russian novel acquir tast long ponder complic philosoph mani unpronounc name patronym place name onfor time yet top list 10 novel must read die know dont kill first patient persist reader discov gyorgi book soap opera load archetyp hero villain fascin secondari charact fill vivid live theyr live contend greatest stori illfat karamazov brother dmitri ivan alexi thoroughli sleezi utterli unlik except he hyster amus father fyodor pavlovich togeth woman provid much stori dramat tension agrafena alexandrovna svetlova known grushenka woman loo moral attract ador dmitri father nobl narr counterpoint katerina ivanovna verkhovtseva jilt dmitri love ivan saintlyuntil she complex tale dostoyevski weav majest timeless profound pick superl dont say excess slow uncommonli bore big russian detractor your disinclin read entir 700 page small font dover thrift edit read ought wait read justli famou chapter grand inquisitor standalon continu astound tighten bolerolik grip provoc thesi startl conclus word dont wait 50 year grand inquisitor read undergradu never quit got know howev everi word dostoyevski set assuredli sacr although reader may find superabund verbiag endear placemyself

Although the book concerns itself with a time in history that covered about four years, from 1921-1925, the story really begins in the 1870s when the Osage Indians were forced to leave their lands in Kansas and resettle to lands they purchased in Oklahoma, land the government thought was useless and worthless. Instead, the land turned out to be so oil rich, the Osage never had to work again, once it was discovered. They were rich! Unfortunately, there were many unscrupulous men and women who actively sought to bilk them out of their money and their land by whatever means they could devise, and they were often the most diabolical plots.
The year 1921 marked what the Bureau of Investigation believed was the beginning of a series of about two dozen murders. Unexplained deaths of otherwise healthy people began to occur as well as unexplained murders or suicides. At first, there was resistance to investigate any of the odd occurrences since Indian lives were not much valued by the white people of that time. Racism toward Indians was rampant and widespread. As investigations led nowhere private investigators were hired by the wealthy Osage. Still, solving the crime was elusive as investigators also seemed to die in unexplained and unresolved circumstances. As the numbers of dead Osage piled up, it became more and more suspicious, but not only racism had to be fought, so did the corruption throughout the justice system which was not as interested in solving the crimes as they would otherwise have been if the victims had not been Indians.
David Grann does an amazing amount of research, drawing a picture of a time that feels lawless and brutal. Men literally got away with murder because of their power and influence. Each of the Osage Indians had a guardian who supposedly represented their interests and controlled their income from the oil wells; they were unable to use their own money at will. Often, the guardians who schemed to control their finances also were engaged in embezzlement of their funds. The Osage people had to jump through hoops to get control of their own money and generally the judge ruled against them and in favor of the white guardian who retained the ability to not only control their money, but to steal it.
In order to rob the allotted portion of the oil lands granted to the Osage Indians, diabolical plans were made to eliminate the Osage owner of headrights and inherit what could not, by law, be given away. Although the Osage tried to protect themselves, they were thwarted by a political system and judicial system that did not value them and adjudicated the cases unfairly.
As the mysterious deaths piled up, the Bureau of Investigation became more engaged and the investigation of the Osage murders (led by Tom White, an old-fashioned honest lawman from a rich background of law enforcement in his family), became its first major homicide investigation, an investigation which led to the creation of Hoovers FBI. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, as it is known today, has more power than it did at the time of the Osage investigation. Today they can make arrests and carry weapons.
The two dozen or so murders that occurred from 1921-1925 were not solved until 1929, and then most of the unsolved cases were dropped when the accused were convicted and sentenced.
As Grann investigated the history of the Osage, other Osage came forward and asked for his help. He discovered that there were many other murders that had not been uncovered and that were unrelated to the murders that were masterminded by the King of the Osage Hills, William H. Hale, who had finally been found guilty in 1926. From 118-1931, murders were still occurring which may or many not have been related to stealing from the Osage and which were seemingly unrelated to the murders planned by Hale. It seemed there were other who had devised evil schemes to cheat the Osage out of their wealth.
Fiendish methods were used. Clues were well hidden or destroyed. People were bought or frightened off. Homes were blown up, people were poisoned with moonshine, corrupt doctors may have injected tainted medications, some victims were shot or thrown from trains. Because there was no one pattern, it was difficult to solve the crimes. Also, they occurred randomly. Most of the Osage were afraid to speak out lest they be murdered also. The only way for anyone to inherit the headright for the allotted land was to be bequeathed it, or to be married to the one that was granted it, or to be a direct descendant. Murder, although heinous, seemed to be the only option in many cases.
Lawmen were corrupt, judges were bought, jurors were bribed. The book is about a time of which little is known, but David Grann has done a wonderful job uncovering even more facts about this odious period. It was a wonderful retelling of history.

*The Flower Moon is a period of growth. In the spring, flowers bloom. In Osage County, the flowers were dying, but the flowers were the Osage Indians.
*Over 2000 members of the Osage tribe were allotted. Each received a portion of land on the reservation, designed to break up their communal way of living.

28552,2766,3796,"I have enjoyed most of Nassim Taleb's books, partly because of his contrarian thinking and partly because of my background in finance. Skin in the Game is another great installment. Some readers might chafe at Taleb's intentionally arrogant observations, but there is some valuable underlying wisdom here.

I happen to work at a university, and Taleb's discussion of individuals who are ""intellectual yet idiot"" (IYI) made me laugh out loud. The term refers to individuals (mostly academics) who are so convinced of their brilliance that when they encounter an idea they do not understand, they assume something is wrong with the new idea -- never stopping to consider that maybe they simply lack understanding. He provides a list of criteria about such people, which is obviously drawn from his experience in academia.

Other highlights for me included an extended discussion of the Lindy effect. Taleb had discussed this previously, I believe in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-from-Disorder/dp/B00A2ZIZYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder</a>, and the idea intrigued me. Here, he provides a fuller explanation of the concept (i.e., that you can roughly estimated the future life of a nonperishable thing, such as a book or a company, to be the same as its life to date).

I plan to re-read this book right away. Taleb notes in Skin in the Game that one can obtain greater utility from rereading a good book than from reading a new book.

28556,1934,1874,"Can Scarlet trust Wolf?

Scarlet has a good life living with her grandmother on a farm in France. She loves living in the country and working the land. Everything changed the day her grandmother disappeared, and Scarlet is the only one who suspects foul play. When a mysterious man named Wolf claims to have information about her grandmother, Scarlet is skeptical. Desperate to find her grandmother, Scarlet and Wolf form a fragile partnership. As Scarlet digs deeper into her Grandmothers disappearance, she realizes her grandmother has many secrets, secrets others will kill for.

Scarlet is a great heroine. Shes smart, determined, and fiercely loyal. Even though the odds of finding her grandmother are slim, she never gives up. Her strength and persistence are admirable. Shes also very kind. Scarlet is the kind of woman who gives people a chance. This is especially true with Wolf. She has no reason to trust him, but Scarlet sees something good in him.

I must admit I find Scarlet and Wolfs romance a bit strange. Understandably, it took them a while to warm up to each other. However, once they did, they seemed to have an instant, powerful connection. At first it didn't feel very realistic to me, but I was warming up to the idea by the end of the book. Im curious to see how their relationship will develop as the series progresses.

I enjoyed seeing more of Cinder in this book. She is slowly adjusting to the idea that not only is she Lunar, but also Princess Selene. A bit more of Cinders history is revealed, and it is heartbreaking. So many people risked so much to save her. Thats a lot of pressure for a young girl to live up to. I believe Cinder is up for the challenge.

I absolutely must mention Cinders new friend, Carswell Thorne. Cinder and Thorne find themselves stuck together in rather unusual circumstances, but they make a good team. He is thoroughly entertaining, and always knows how to lighten the mood. I cant help but like him, and I look forward to seeing him again in the next book.

Scarlet is an excellent addition to this series. I really enjoyed following Cinder and Scarlets plots, and they came together beautifully at the end of the book. The switches between viewpoints are very smooth, and it kept the pace moving and the tension steadily building. By the end of the book I was racing through the pages. I will definitely be picking up the third book immediately!

28560,2766,1555,"Nomadland covers an interesting and unique topic -- itinerant workers, mostly elderly, who live in RVs and staff Amazon warehouses and similar jobs. The author is a journalist who reported on this phenomenon for a couple of years, and eventually wrote this book. She could have taken this topic in any of several interesting directions. She chose to go the hardship direction (i.e., these workers are misused -- underpaid, injured, etc.) even though it seems that her subjects generally do not see themselves as hardship cases. The most interesting passages were about the friendships these workers shared and the fact that many of those chose this difficult style when they could have relied on family members for financial support instead.

The writing style was disjointed, and the book does seem like a collection of serial pieces mashed into one whole. My big gripe with the book, though, is Bruder's strange attempt to insert racial politics near the end of the book. After spending most of the book addressing the plight of these workers, she notes that most of them are white and comments on their ""white privilege."" How are these people privileged? I thought they were disadvantaged. She provides an example of how they are privileged (I am not making this up): One of the elderly workers was pulled over by a traffic cop named officer Nunez, but the worker got off with a warning.

28562,4694,3514,"This is neither a book nor an author with whom I was familiar; however, I have long been intrigued by stories of immortality so I couldn't pass this one up when I came across it.  Fortunately, it is a story worth the read.

I don't want to give too much away as part of the pleasure of this novel is how Ms. Horns protagonist and her lover become immortal, and how they move from life to life throughout history.  Suffice to say that Rachel, who has lived for 2000 years, is not enamored of being immortal.  Now, in the 21st century, with advances in science & DNA analysis, she finally has an opportunity to investigate her situation more closely since, in the current iteration of her family, her granddaughter studies longevity.  But even this is less important that the web of relationships Rachel must sever or sustain to keep her secret in the face of all-seeing technology.

In the end, this very readable book offers an enjoyable and interesting look at the consequences of living forever.  Rachel and the numerous other charactersmainly her extended familyare vivid in their naivete and normalcy.

28563,946,2931,"Thanks to NetGalley and Random House for the opportunity to read and review Tempests and Slaughter by Tamora Pierce. Arram, young and gifted beyond his age, attends Mage Academy with older students. He doesnt have friends but that soon changes when he causes chaos with magic and has a conference with the Academy masters. They deem him gifted and place him with other students similar to him. Academy life becomes much more enjoyable and entertaining after the new placement. Arram, Varice and Zorne become great friends and when Arram is bullied because of his young age, his two new friends help him cope and discover how much fun their time at the academy can be. Varice is smart, fun and a very good kitchen witch while Zorne is seventh in line to the throne of the current prince. The three friends each have different gifts which grow in strength the longer they attend classes. The main focus of the story is on Arram, his powers, education and relationships but we do get a glimpse of the inner workings of the lives of Varice and Zorne. Arram has to learn to build the stomach for being around horribly injured people and his strength as a healer. Varice deals with being looked down on because shes female and a lowly kitchen witch. Zorne is continuing to move up higher on the list of heirs to the throne, and is worried about his unhealthy mother and how to deal with his protective guards. The story is strong and the world building is a mix of renaissance and ancient Greece. I thought the whole approach to Arrams puberty was odd and I understand that it will potentially help male preteens with their own changes.

28566,2524,862,"Saints for All Occasions begins in 2009 .  Nora is on the way to the hospital to see her son Patrick, who has been in a wreck.  She learns that that Patrick has died. As she is driving home, we learn that she is very angry with her sister.  That she wonders how she is going to tell her other children.  That there are some very big lies in Noras life.  For one thing, her children don't even know she has a sister.

From there we are taken back to to 1957, where  we first meet Nora and her sister Theresa.  They live in a small town in Ireland.  Nora is expected to marry Charlie, a boy she has known practically all her life.  When Charlie heads off to America, it is assumed that Nora will follow him.  She does and brings her sister Theresa along with her.

Shortly after arriving in America, something happens that sets the stage for the rest of the novel.  We follow both Nora and her sister and the different paths they take.  All the while, the story is bracketed by the culture of the Irish and Catholic in America from the 1950s onward.

So its just a light romance  but with a bit more drama than I expected and a bit less humor than I expected.

28572,1596,3750,"The Future of Humanity: Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth by Michio Kaku

The Future of Humanity is an awe-inspiring exploration of the pioneers who have the energy, vision, and the resources to change the fate of humanity. He also analyzes the advance in technology that will make it possible to leave the Earth and settle elsewhere. Cofounder of string field theory, best-selling author and professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York, Dr. Michio Kaku takes the reader on a unique journey beyond Earth. This splendid 352-page book includes fourteen chapters broken out by the following three parts: I. Leaving the Earth, II. Voyage to the Stars, and III. Life in the Universe.

Positives:
1. A Kaku trademark, great science writing for the general public. Informative, interesting and fun to read.
2. The fascinating topic of the future of humanity in the hands of an expert.
3. Excellent format. The book is broken out logically and in chronological order of future events. Also, each chapter is introduced by chapter-appropriate quotes.
4. An excellent introduction that clearly states the main purpose of the book. In this book, I will describe the technologies that will take us even farther as we explore the planets and the stars. In part 1, we will discuss the effort to create a permanent moon base and to colonize and terraform Mars. To do this, we will have to exploit the fourth wave of science, which consists of artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and biotechnology.
5. Interesting factoids throughout. The V-2 set a number of world records, shattering all past achievements in terms of speed and range for a rocket. It was the first long-range guided ballistic missile. It was the first rocket to break the sound barrier. And most impressively, it was the first rocket ever to leave the boundary of the atmosphere and enter outer space.
6. Thought-provoking philosophy. Since science is the engine of prosperity, nations that turn their backs on science and technology eventually enter a downward spiral.
7. Excellent look at the pioneers with deep pockets and their dreams for humanity. Today, it is not the private fortunes of the members of the Baltimore Gun Club fueling this new space race but the checkbooks of moguls like Jeff Bezos. Instead of waiting for NASA to give him permission to build rockets and a launchpad with taxpayer dollars, he founded his own company, Blue Origin, and is building them himself, with his own pocket money.
8. For the love of astronomy. Asteroids, in some sense, are like flying gold mines in outer space. For example, in July 2015, one came within a million miles of Earth, or about four times the distance from the Earth to the moon. It was about nine hundred meters (or about three thousand feet) across and was estimated to contain ninety million tons of platinum in its core, worth $5.4 trillion.
9. Discusses what it will take to live on Mars. But settlers would have to get used to the gravity on Mars, which is only 40 percent of the gravity on Earth, and, as on the moon, they would have to exercise vigorously to avoid muscle and bone loss.
10. Discusses potential life-supporting venues besides the planets. Perhaps the most intriguing of all is Europa, one of the original moons discovered by Galileo. Europa, like some of the other moons of the gas giants, is covered with a thick layer of ice.
11. Such discussions are not possible without the great contributions from Einstein. Albert Einstein, recognizing that Newtons laws could be flawed, showed that Mercurys orbit could be explained by an entirely new effect, the warping of space-time according to his theory of relativity.)
12. Robots in space, oh my. The next push for self-replicating robots came in 1980, when NASA spearheaded a study called Advanced Automation for Space Missions. The study report concluded that self-replicating robots would be crucial to building lunar settlements and identified at least three types of robots that would be needed. Mining robots would collect basic raw materials, construction robots would melt and refine the materials and assemble new parts, and repair robots would mend and maintain themselves and their colleagues without human intervention.
13. One of the joys of reading Kaku are the numerous references to popular science fiction movies that help readers understand science topics. Movies like Passengers, Interstellar, Arrival and of course the classic 2001 get a lot of love.
14. Discusses a variety of types of spaceships. The ramjet fusion rocket is another enticing concept. It would look like a giant ice cream cone and would scoop up hydrogen gas in interstellar space, then concentrate it in a fusion reactor to generate energy. Like a jet or a cruise missile, the ramjet rocket would be quite economical. Because jets gulp ordinary air, they do not have to carry their own oxidizer, which reduces cost. Since there is an unlimited amount of hydrogen gas in space for fuel, the spaceship should be able to accelerate forever. As with the solar sail, the engines specific impulse is infinite.
15. Did somebody say wormholes? In conclusion, negative energy does exist, and if enough negative energy could somehow be collected, we could, in principle, create a wormhole machine or a warp drive engine, fulfilling some of the wildest fantasies of science fiction.
16. The fascinating topic of aging and immortality. In fact, there is an influx of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs investing millions to defeat the aging process. Not content to wire up the world, their next goal is to live forever. Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google, hopes to do nothing less than cure death.
17. The quest to find extraterrestrial life. A new branch of science has recently been born, called exobiology, to study life on distant worlds with ecosystems different from those found on Earth. So far, exobiologists have had difficulty trying to find a path to creating life-forms that are not based on the carbon chemistry that gives us rich and diverse molecules.
18. A look at the Kardashev scale of civilizations. His ranking was as follows: 1. A Type I civilization utilizes all the energy of the sunlight that falls on that planet. 2. A Type II civilization utilizes all the energy its sun produces. 3. A Type III civilization utilizes the energy of an entire galaxy.
19. The search for the theory of everything. What theory can unify general relativity and the quantum theory at the Planck energy? Einstein spent the last thirty years of his life chasing after a theory of everything that could allow him to read the mind of God, but he failed. This remains one of the biggest questions facing modern physics.
20. The three possibilities for the ultimate fate of the universe. So my point of view combines both the Copernican and anthropic principle. I believe that our universe is not special, as in the Copernican principle, except for two features: that it is very stable and that it is compatible with life as we know it. So instead of having an infinite number of parallel universes floating in the Nirvana of hyperspace, most of them are unstable, and perhaps only a handful of them survive to create life like ours.

Negatives:
1. I would have preferred a better laid out book. I would have added timelines, highlight factoids, and take advantage of linking capability in eBooks. Time to take these books to another level.
2. Limited visual supplementary material for such a great narrative.
3. Honestly, how many readers even at its most basic will truly understand string theory?
4. Lets be honest its hard to live up to the The Future of the Mind.
5. In order to reach a broader audience, depth pays a price.

In summary, I really enjoyed this book! Kaku is the tour guide you want to teach us about the future of humanity. This is what popular science writing should all be about, inspiring minds to dream big while keeping us grounded in sound science. What makes this book a treat to read is the combination of Kakus mastery of the topic, his enthusiasm, his ability to convey complex topics in an accessible manner, and providing readers with excellent examples from popular science fiction movies. Some shortcomings aside, I highly recommend it!

28577,1416,3846,"Oh. My. Word. Give this book all the stars! Lorie Langdons inventive take on Oliver Twist completely stole my heart. Its fresh and witty, one of those rare books where you feel like you are beholding something special.

I adored Olivia as both the hard-scrabbling orphan posing as a boy and the lady trying to find where she belongs. She's come so far from where she was but she does not abandon her roots either. She steals small trinkets from the wealthy while she's at their parties, then hocks them so she can give food and money to some orphaned boys she looks after. All while dressed up as a boy, naturally, as no lady could be caught on that side of town. Her actions speak so much to her character.

And Jack! Well, there are no words for how I feel about Jack and his evolution as a character- its mostly heart eyes and flailing. It's true Jack has done some bad things in the name of surviving the streets but he also looked after the kids in his care. He is complex and charming and my precise kind of rogue.

When their paths cross, Olivia immediately recognizes the Artful Dodger who took her under his wing. But he knew her as the boy Ollie and has no idea who she's become. They are drawn to each other, while not trusting each other, although Jack doesn't know the half of it. I loved the evolution of their relationship and the way they understood one another, even if they had different aims.

With Olivia, Jack doesn't have to be the Artful Dodger or the gentlemen Jack MacCarron, he's just himself. And Olivia can be herself as well. It was heartbreaking to see how Jack didn't believe he deserved Olivia, nor would he allow himself to hope for something more.

Of course, there's danger and intrigue and I was crossing my fingers the whole way for a happy ending because I could not recall Oliver Twist having one. (A quick note: I'm not sure that I've ever read Oliver Twist. I did see the movie when I was a kid but that was many, many years ago. All that to say, I had very little recollection of what happened in the story but this did not keep me from appreciating this version.)

The character growth was incredible. Jack comes to realize true love means sacrifice- something he never experienced as a child but feels for Olivia. What he does with this realization, well, I'm still swooning. Watching Olivia realize she needed to trust her loved ones with the truth of her background and current troubles was also very moving to see. But I was most moved by Olivia and Jack taking a chance on each other.

I flew through this story, needing to know what would happen and whether Olivia and Jack could be together and if Monks would get his comeuppance. The writing was fresh and clever and I laughed out loud more than a few times. When I finished the last page, I was completely satisfied and immediately wanted to tell everyone to read it.

Bottom line: I freaking LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!

28579,1036,428,"I took up Andre Acimans novel Call Me By Your Name to try to figure out why the movie based on it  seemed so underdeveloped.  My suspicion was that the problem had to do with the very nature of film, as a medium where the interiority in characters that is possible in fiction is nearly impossible because movies, after all, give us mostly surface.

Well, the very interiority I was missing in the movie becomes a severe problem in Acimans novel because that interiority is so limited and one-dimensional.  Elios pining over Oliver, with language alternating between flatness and embroidery,  simply becomes tiresome.  A short story might have worked, but this novel just goes on and on.  (Aciman is a Proust scholar, and I confess to having the thought that perhaps Albertine hangs over this book too much.)

A scene in the movie that didn't work for me  Elios supposed coming out to Oliver  makes just as little sense in the novel.  It simply doesnt happen in the words that are exchanged.

28586,4312,2421,"For Middle-Grade March I selected a couple of books based on reviews, personal recs, and maybe for the covers alone. This one was for the cover alone. But this was NOT a case of good cover/bad book. Not by a long shot.

This was one of those books that you didn't now you needed. It is a retelling of Snow White and Rose Red, two young sisters who are forced to move to a cottage in the woods after their father goes missing. As their mother grows more distant by the day, succumbing to her grief, the two venture off into the woods in search of adventure. And sometimes adventure just seems to find them. They befriend a boy who lives underground and come into contact with wolves, a bear, thieves and even a little man who seems to need rescuing over and over again.

I have no read the original Grimm tale so I am not sure how closely resembling it this book is, but I can say there was certainly magic on every page and it the anticipation of seeing the wonderful illustrations kept me up long after my bedtime. I dare to say that there was even magic in the very pages. I felt like a kid again.

Martin's writing is both magical and breezy. This is not a long book, clocking in at just over 200 pages. The girls are well fleshed out with individual personalities. I recommend this to anyone looking for fairy tales or simply something to get you out of that book slump.

1 note & 5 highlights (All visible)

I absolutely loved every word, sentence and paragraph.
As usual J.R. Ward has delivered a story that has all the elements of yet another masterpiece.
You are not the reader, but a participant in this world. You are connected in every sense of the word.
You don't just read her Black Dagger books. You live it. You breath it. You fully experience it.
In truth, you yearn for the next story like an addict for their next fix.

28594,1952,3423,"I had one question to ask when I finished reading this Victorian mystery - when is the next book in this series going to be released because I need to read it NOW!!!! Compelling, thrilling, and completely addictive, A TREACHEROUS CURSE by Deanna Raybourn is the perfect historical mystery and I devoured this book in one sitting.

In London, in 1888 an ancient Egyptian curse has plagued an English expedition and seems to have followed those involved back to England. With a man missing alongside a priceless diadem, the authorities are called in. But Veronica Speedwell and her mysterious colleague Stoker soon find themselves caught him in this mystery because for Stoker it involves those who have wreaked havoc on his life in the past and changed him into the man he is today. And to make things even stranger, the ghost of Anubis is striking fear into the hearts of many as it roams the streets of London. But if Veronica and Stoker do not uncover who is behind it all, Stoker may just find himself as a scapegoat for the second time in his life ...

With plenty of mystery, detailed history, and witty moments throughout, A TREACHEROUS CURSE by Deanna Raybourn went above and beyond my expectations and had me hooked from the very beginning. While this is the third book in this series it is easily read as a standalone which is what I did, but I have already bought the previous two books because I loved these characters so much.

Veronica is everything you want in a main character - strong, intelligent, blunt, and witty, and a pleasure to read, and I loved how much she flaunted her uniqueness. Stoker is more mysterious but in this story, we certainly get to see more of the man beneath the cooler facade. Also clever and humorous, I loved the relationship that exists between these two - two similar people who are different from most of society, who understand each other's idiosyncrasies, and their mutual respect and admiration for each other which I have to say I hope will lead to more. The drama, the setting, the history, and the dialogue are all excellent and I could easily imagine this on our tv screens.

A TREACHEROUS CURSE by Deanna Raybourn is a must-read for Victorian mystery and historical fiction fans worldwide and I cannot wait for the next book in this series!!",1520380800,5,one question ask finish read victorian mysteri next book seri go releas need read compel thrill complet addict treacher cur deanna raybourn perfect histor mysteri devour book one sit london 1888 ancient egyptian cur plagu english expedit seem follow involv back england man miss alongsid priceless diadem author call veronica speedwel mysteri colleagu stoker soon find caught mysteri stoker involv wreak havoc life past chang man today make thing even stranger ghost anubi strike fear heart mani roam street london veronica stoker uncov behind stoker may find scapegoat second time life plenti mysteri detail histori witti moment throughout treacher cur deanna raybourn went beyond expect hook begin third book seri easili read standalon alreadi bought previou two book love charact much veronica everyth want main charact strong intellig blunt witti pleasur read love much flaunt uniqu stoker mysteri stori certainli get see man beneath

28601,1373,1661,"I read Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West to fill the prompt of a book that is also a stage play or musical for the 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge.

This book started slooooooooow. It ended in a bit of a madcap rush, which was odd since the author spent some 400+ densely packed pages between the two points dithering on topics such as social castes, religions, politics, and the nature of evil.

Wicked follows the life of Elphaba, the green-skinned wicked witch, from birth to death. Maguire presents an interesting twist on the familiar story of Oz, but I don't feel like the book ever fully lived up to its potential. There were too many political/social issues that were never fully addressedwhy spend 20 pages writing about issues you're only going to skirt around and never deal with?and many other topics that seemingly only served to distract from what could have been a much more streamlined, straightforward story. Even for an allegorical novel, this seemed like a page-padding ploy.

Also, Maguire seemed to be channeling Lewis Carroll, and taking every opportunity to use obscure words when simpler ones could do (this was even jokingly referred to by a character in the text, who explained that yes, he knew what that word was and that he was using it correctly because he had looked it up). The one redeeming feature of the book was the slightly twisted sense of humor that was present throughout.

I really, really wanted to like this book a lot more than I did, and I can honestly say Ive never more anxiously anticipated someone being doused by a bucket of water so I could finish a book.

28607,3964,3840,"I'm a big fan of the Mercyverse, but it had been quite a while since I had read the Alpha and Omega books, so in preparation for the release of Burn Bright I did a quick re-read of the first four books of the series. I had forgotten how the pace and tone of Charles and Anna's stories differs from Mercy's. It was refreshing, not only to recall the details from the previous stories but to see more in depth some of the characters who are only mentioned briefly in the main storyline.

I really enjoyed this most recent book. I think that I especially liked it because it was set in Aspen Creek and we got to see more of the inner workings of the Marrok's pack. This is also the first book, in either series, in which I have not had a nearly uncontrollable urge to strangle Leah. Much. As usual I loved the dynamic between Charles and Anna. The longer they are together the more I like them as a couple. I think because, unlike romance novel relationships, their story isn't about the initial attraction and getting together, but how their relationship grows and strengthens over time. And isn't that really what real relationships are about? They also have to navigate family and community and weird life threatening situations, sometimes simultaneously. Speaking of weird life threatening situations, there were a lot, and I mean a lot, of revelations in this book which should keep both storylines hopping for some time to come. I'll have to do at least one re-read, possibly two, to make sure I caught all the details that needed highlighting.

28609,564,3840,"There is nothing that I love more than finishing a book and having a greater understanding of certain things, like items on the cover, or the meaning behind a title. I am in love with the cover for Burn Bright in a whole new way after reading this story. Burn Bright is the fifth book in the Alpha & Omega series, fifteenth in the Mercy Thompson World, and it was a compelling read that had me glued to the pages! I have read the entire Mercy Thompson series as well as the Alpha & Omega series and I loved the tie between these series. I liked the side of Bran I saw in the last Mercy book, Silence Fallen, and to have Bran be missing in this book (and the reasons behind itgasp) showed an entirely new dynamic in this world.

Charles and Anna have found a good rhythm between them. They have worked out the issues from their pasts that needed to be dealt with and the partnership together is just wonderful. With his dad gone, Charles has had to step into Brans role and when a wildling called for assistance it was up to Charles to answer the call for help. Anna had gone along because as an Omega she could potentially help ease matters. When they reached their destination what they did not expect was to discover clues that had them stumbling upon a conspiracy that reached back decades into the past. In order to bring about the sinister plan it required subterfuge and betrayal of one very close in the pack. The outcome would end in sorrow and the pack would only start to grasp the enormity of the plan that was in play.

Burn Bright was just right! I loved the relationship that has developed between Charles and Anna, they are a force to be reckoned with. I love how Anna is now thriving and is starting to find herself. I enjoyed learning about the wildlings, a dynamic to the Marrok pack that I was excited to know more about. I even liked Brans mate, Leah, a little bit in this story too. There was even a part of this story that was told from her point of view! The plot was fast paced and the mystery of what was truly happening was blended well amongst the relationships taking place in this story. My heart swelled for the wins that took place and my heart mourned for the losses that occurred. I just love this world that Patricia Briggs has created and I am looking forward to the next addition to the Mercy Thompson World! I highly recommend you get your hands on a copy of Burn Bright when it hits the shelves!

28610,666,3840,"Burn Bright by Patricia Briggs is the 5th book in her Alpha & Omega series.  The Alpha & Omega series is another fascinating werewolf storyline that takes place in the world of Mercy Thompson. Only this series revolves around Charles Cornick, who is the enforcer for his Alpha father ( Bran), and his wife Anna, who is an Omega wolf.

This story begins shortly after the last Mercy Thompson story ended, and Bran (The Marrok), is away on a secret trip.  In his absence, Charles is in on call for problems, and when he receives a call for help from a fae mate to a wilding wolf; he and Anna take the 20 minute ride to the mountains.  The wildings are somewhat broken, damaged and unstable wolves, who live separately from the pack in the wilderness.

When Charles and Anna arrive at their destination, only the fae mate can explain what has happened.  His wolf mate has been kidnapped, and is being held in a cage; due a promise made to his mate, the fae cannot go help his mate, as has no control over his dangerous powers, if he sees her being harmed.  Charles and Anna will find Hester (the mate) and help her escape, and in so doing, will kill those who threatened her. But before they can get her back home, another group attacks, unfortunately Hester is killed, as well as the attackers.  When they come back to the house, the fae mate has killed himself, and has left a clue that there is a traitor among Brans pack.

When Charles, Anna, Leah (Brans mate) and the rest of the pack devise a plan to send three teams to visit all the wildings, to warn them and try to find the traitor.  What follows is an intense exciting adventure, where multiple times Anna will find herself very much in danger.  Being an Omega wolf  brings her right in the middle of the unstable wolves.  The first wolf, felt the draw of an Omega (they can calm them and bring peace), and takes Anna into his mind to try to fight off a curse set by a witch.  It takes Charles help to allow Anna to break the curse and save herself. In the midst of all of this action, Charles comes to realize why Bran is away, technically in hiding, and is determined to prove his theory with Annas help.  But most importantly, they must stop the traitor before more wildings are killed.  This is monstrous task, as the evil villain is much stronger than any of them realize.

I love Charles and Anna together; the chemistry between these two is electric and the way they balance one another out is amazing, especially in his role as enforcer.

 I love Brother Wolfs talking to Charles, and his love of Anna.  Asil and Wellesy were very good, and surprisingly so was Leah, whom most of us do not like. We also get to learn more information our Mercys early years as a member of Brans pack, as well as learning more about Annas powers and Charless witchborn powers.

As we race to a wild climatic finish, we find ourselves holding our breaths as there are some surprises that shock us as to who the traitor is, and how powerful and evil the villain is

But most of all, it is the love of Anna that keeps Charles sane,  and her ability as an Omega to be able to calm wolves.  They make such a great couple, working together to solve any crimes within the pack range, not to mention their chemistry is very hot.  Burn Bright was an exciting, pulse pounding, fast paced, captivating read, with some surprising revelations and a wonderful couple.",1520380800,5,burn bright patricia brigg 5th book alpha omega seri alpha omega seri anoth fascin werewolf storylin take place world merci thompson seri revolv around charl cornick enforc alpha father bran wife anna omega wolf stori begin shortli last merci thompson stori end bran marrok away secret trip absenc charl call problem receiv call help fae mate wild wolf anna take 20 minut ride mountain wild somewhat broken damag unstabl wolv live separ pack wilder charl anna arriv destin fae mate explain happen wolf mate kidnap held cage due promis made mate fae cannot go help mate control danger power see harm charl anna find hester mate help escap kill threaten get back home anoth group attack unfortun hester kill well attack come back hous fae mate kill left clue traitor among bran pack charl anna leah bran mate rest pack devi plan send three team visit wild warn tri find traitor follow intens excit adventur

28615,71,1179,"I wanted to read this book as soon as I saw the description. A haunted castle? Irish folklore? A giant library? A dark and brooding viscount? Yes, please!

When Carragh Ryan interviews for a job inventorying an ancient family library, she has no idea what lies before her. From the snooty matriarch, Nessa, to the frosty heir, Aiden, and his bitter sister, Kyla, the Gallagher family seems anything but welcoming. Carragh determines to enjoy her time in the magnificent stained-glass window-lined library, get the job done, and get out. But the re-opening of the investigation into the murder of Aiden's parents two decades earlier stirs up family secrets and appears to provoke the Darkling Bride. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn of the legend of the Darkling Bride, the tragic tale of Jenny Gallagher and Evan Chase, and the details of the fateful summer leading up to Lily and Cillian Gallagher's deaths. When unexplained happenings begin occurring in the castle, and Carragh finds herself at the mercy of two spirits--one that seems to want to help her solve the mystery of what happened to Aiden's parents and one that seems to want her gone--Carragh determines to find the clues she is sure are hidden in the library. But as she gets closer to the truth, someone--or something--will stop at nothing to keep the truth from coming to light.

This book and I got off to a rocky start. After seeing so many good reviews for the author's Tudor series, the contemporary romance style of writing was not what I was expecting, nor were the characters. But the mystery of the Darkling Bride and the castle's murders soon had me hooked. Then I was thrown again by the numerous points of view that kept popping up and the fact that we had three timelines to keep track of. But I soon saw how these could all work together. But then I was thrown again by a plot twist. I got to the point where I wondered how much more the author was going to throw into this story and how it could possibly be satisfying beneath the weight of so many elements. But it worked . . . mostly.

I can't quite put my finger on why, but this book ended up being just ho-hum for me. This is the type of book that sounds amazing in theory but gets a little lost in its execution. I enjoyed the Irish setting and the folklore tales, and it's got a great Gothic vibe going on, but it was fairly predictable. I can't say that I felt like I really got to know any of the characters, and I also felt like Carragh getting chosen for the job in the first place was a coincidence, so it never really felt like she was fated to be there. A couple of questions related to the mystery weren't answered when everything wrapped up, and there really is no romance to speak of. Just a couple of stolen kisses that could likely be due to being in such close proximity for an extended time. There's a hint at the end that Carragh and Aiden might end up as something more, but I would have appreciated something more concrete.

Still, it is a very evocative tale with a nice combination of history, mystery, and spookiness, and I was flying through the final pages to see how everything would shake out. If you're a fan of Irish folklore and are looking for something a little different in historical mystery, The Darkling Bride should fit the bill.",1520467200,3,want read book soon saw descript haunt castl irish folklor giant librari dark brood viscount ye plea carragh ryan interview job inventori ancient famili librari idea lie snooti matriarch nessa frosti heir aiden bitter sister kyla gallagh famili seem anyth welcom carragh determin enjoy time magnific stainedglass windowlin librari get job done get reopen investig murder aiden parent two decad earlier stir famili secret appear provok darkl bride seri flashback learn legend darkl bride tragic tale jenni gallagh evan chase detail fate summer lead lili cillian gallagh death unexplain happen begin occur castl carragh find merci two spiritson seem want help solv mysteri happen aiden parent one seem want gonecarragh determin find clue sure hidden librari get closer truth someoneor somethingwil stop noth keep truth come light book got rocki start see mani good review author tudor seri contemporari romanc style write expect charact mysteri darkl bride castl murder soon hook thrown numer point view kept pop fact

  Deeprath Castle in the Wicklow Mountains near Glendalough has been in the Gallagher family since the 12th century. The current Viscount, Aidan, has decided to sign it over to the National Trust over everyone's protests. It holds bad memories for him as his parents were murdered there 23 years ago when he was 10 and this visit was the first time he has returned since then.

  Young Carragh Ryan is hired to archive the extensive private library. An enigma herself, she is of Chinese descent adopted by Irish parents when she was 4. She is completely fascinated by the history as  famed Gothic novelist, Evan Chase, came  to the castle,  married the daughter of that viscount, and never wrote again.  His wife committed suicide in 1882 about three years after their marriage. He left his young son there and returned to England dying several years later.

  The story revolves those three stories- Jenny and Evan in 1882, the time of the murder of Aidan's parents in 1992  and current times where they are trying to uncover the parents murderers. The castle is full of treasures, history and ghosts.

  It was slow starting but once the story went along and the action picked up, it became much more interesting. I also liked all the history of the area and the story of St. Kevin. For those who like atmospheric novels, this is a good one.

28617,1571,786,"This third installment in the Jack Reacher saga is my least favorite so far.  Dont get me wrong, theres still plenty of page turning suspense and action and its hard to put down.  I won't go into any plot details; my problem with Tripwire is author Lee Child decides to have Reacher become romantically involved with the daughter of his former boss and mentor Leon Garber.  Jodie Garber Jacob is 9 years Reachers junior and has nursed a crush on him since she was 15 years old and he liked her too in a pervy way.  Its a warm, fuzzy side of our hero that weve not seen before and while it adds some depth to the character the reveal makes him seem less formidable and cramps his style.  The other thing that didn't completely work for me was the bad guy; Victor Truman Hook Hobie has a complicated background that gradually unfolds.  Child goes a bit over the top with Hobie and he comes off like a second rate Bond villain.  Theres a clever twist at the end and a satisfying payoff that should please most readers.

28625,4133,1523,"Ive had Carrie Fishers The Princess Diarist sitting on my bookshelf for over a year now.  I had just purchased my copy a few weeks before she tragically passed away in December 2016, and having been a fan of hers for most of my life, I was just too heartbroken to pick it up and read it.  Even this week when I finally did open the book, just seeing those old pics of her brought tears to my eyes. Carrie Fisher had a bigger than life personality that always made me chuckle when I watched her in interviews and that personality really comes shining through in The Princess Diarist.

For me, the high point of The Princess Diarist was, interestingly enough, not the actual diary entries themselves, which are included in the center of the book.  The diary entries are entertaining enough and shed a lot of light on how a 19-year old Carrie felt about a variety of topics  her newfound fame, her attraction to men who weren't good choices, her infatuation with Harrison Ford, etc.  But what I enjoyed most about this book, however, were Carries own reflections as shes looking back at her 19 year old self nearly 40 years later.  With her trademark wit, she gives some thoughtful yet hilarious commentary about the affair with Harrison, what it was like to be part of the Star Wars phenomenon, and what its like to be an aging actress in Hollywood.  She also talks a lot in the later pages about going to cons and meeting fans, signing autographs, and how wild it is to know how important she and Star Wars are to so many people.

Its a quick and fun read, although not quite what I had hoped for when it came to the diary entries themselves.  I guess, as a Star Wars junkie, I was hoping for behind-the-scenes Star Wars moments beyond just the affair with Harrison.  In that sense, I felt a little let down by the book but its still a solid read, especially for any fan of Carrie Fisher.  3.5 STARS",1520467200,4,ive carri fisher princess diarist sit bookshelf year purchas copi week tragic pas away decemb 2016 fan life heartbroken pick read even week final open book see old pic brought tear eye carri fisher bigger life person alway made chuckl watch interview person realli come shine princess diarist high point princess diarist interestingli enough actual diari entri includ center book diari entri entertain enough shed lot light 19year old carri felt varieti topic newfound fame attract men werent good choic infatu harrison ford etc enjoy book howev carri reflect she look back 19 year old self nearli 40 year later trademark wit give thought yet hilari commentari affair harrison like part star war phenomenon like age actress hollywood also talk lot later page go con meet fan sign autograph wild know import star war mani peopl quick fun read although quit hope came diari entri
28626,1278,1998,"Iona Sheehan travels to County Mayo in Ireland, to connect with her family roots--and specifically with the family history of magic and destiny her grandmother has told her.

She quickly connects with her Irish cousins, Branna and Connor O'Dwyer, and finds her grandmother's stories, and her own dreams that have haunted her since childhood, are true. She's a witch--and the vital third member of the triangle needed to confront a lurking danger that has pursued her family for a thousand years.

Iona quickly warms to having a family that embraces her rather than thinking her strange and uninteresting, and learning the use of the magic her grandmother has shown her. Branna has her shop, where she sells the potions and charms whe makes; Connor has his hawks and the forest walk business he runs; it's not long before Iona is working at Boyle McGrath's stable, leading group rides and giving lessons to eager students.

But Iona and her cousins, as well as the handsome and delectable Boyle, his partner Finn, and friend and employee Meara, all know that the lurking threat that goes right back to the beginning of the O'Dwyer family is growing closer. Cavan, or what remains of him after the long-ago confrontations with the dark witch Sorka, their many times great-grandmother, is determined to seize the O'Dwyer magic, combine it with his own, and rule the world.

Iona, the least experienced of the three O'Dwyer cousins, is somehow the lynchpin of the coming confrontation.

Of course, romance is also lurking. Boyle and Iona are deeply attracted but have difficulty staying on the same page. Branna for reasons she won't state explicitly, is convinced she can't have a relationship with Finn. Connor and Meara seem to be almost unaware of each other.

This is the start of a trilogy, and not all of this is resolved in this book. If you like Nora Robert's fantasy romances, though, this is a very satisfying start to the trilogy, with characters that you can love and, sometimes, want to wack upside the head sometimes. The magic is real within the world of the book, but not cost-free, and requires work, discipline, and a willingness to pay the price it imposes.

Very enjoyable.

28627,2046,3508,"Six friends celebrate their graduation from Oxford University at a farmhouse in France. The last night of their alcohol-fueled party turns disastrous after an uninvited nineteen-year-old neighbor goes missing from the house. The female, named Severine, had driven a wedge between the friends with her sexy looks and flirty disposition. The women felt threatened by the younger woman while the men returned her attention.  After an investigation, it is not clear if anyone at the farmhouse had anything to do with her disappearance.

Ten years later, Severines body is found in a well outside of the farmhouse.  Each of the friends is questioned by a French detective. Kate Channing is not concerned with the investigation but begins to unravel after repeated interrogations. Accusations and frictions slowly grow as each group member reveals what they remember from that night.

28631,842,3823,"Vicki DeVine (yes, she hates her name) got the run-down resort, The Jumble, on one of the Finger Lakes as her settlement in her divorce from Yorick Dane (I love that name). It's located on Lake Silence in the small town of Sproing which is only noted for its isolation and the rabbit-like Sproingers that live in the area. The story takes place about a year after the last book and the events known as the Great Deprivation.
Her sole tenant is Aggie Crowe though Vicki's first hint that Aggie isn't human is when she finds Aggie heating up an eyeball for lunch. Turns out it came from a dead body on the property. Since Sproing doesn't have its own police department, a highway patrol officer named Grimshaw is dispatched to the crime scene.
Like all the books about The Others, this is a world populated with rich characterizations and details. It took me a while to get used to Vicki, partly because her POV is in First Person unlike the POVs of the other characters. Vicki is presented at first as a wreck of a woman, abused by her ex-husband to the point that her nerves take over when a man accosts her in any way. But the First Person viewpoint allows the reader to really get to know Vicki. She has a wry sense of humor and more courage than she thinks. Her musings about Ilya Sanguinati, the leader of the vampire clan on Lake Silence, are anything by modest, and I found them pretty funny. I do like her friendship with Julian, the Intuit bookstore owner. There's lots of great secondary characters that I hope to learn more about if the Others series continues. It's a fertile territory for more stories about the terra indigene and the humans who try to live with them.
Speaking of humans, we have here some more petty criminals than the evil ones in the earlier books, but they still try to do a lot of damage. The Others series at its core are books about the evils that men do to their environment and the earth, and those businessmen who try to wrest The Jumble away to develop it as a playground for their pals are representative of the unthinking consequences of this kind of thinking. Ms. Bishop never preaches; indeed, the Others, as predators, would rather solve these issues in their own way. As Ilya says, ""It's been our observation that humans often wilfully believe that they can repeat the actions of those who went before them and not suffer the same consequences."" Consequences from the Others usually means meat for the terra indigene.",1520467200,5,vicki devin ye hate name got rundown resort jumbl one finger lake settlement divorc yorick dane love name locat lake silenc small town spro note isol rabbitlik sproinger live area stori take place year last book event known great depriv sole tenant aggi crow though vicki first hint aggi isnt human find aggi heat eyebal lunch turn came dead bodi properti sinc spro doesnt polic depart highway patrol offic name grimshaw dispatch crime scene like book other world popul rich character detail took get use vicki partli pov first person unlik pov charact vicki present first wreck woman abus exhusband point nerv take man accost way first person viewpoint allow reader realli get know vicki wri sen humor courag think muse ilya sanguinati leader vampir clan lake silenc anyth modest found pretti funni like friendship julian intuit bookstor owner there lot great secondari charact hope learn other seri continu fertil territori stori terra indigen

28633,2515,3823,"Fabolous beginning!

When Meg and Simon's arc was done, I was so sad to see one of my favorite series EVER come to an end. So many of the characters had endeared themselves into my heart but Anne Bishop knew she had gold in her hands (or I should say in her brain) and she was willing to continue the series to the great happiness of this reader.

I have anxiously been waiting for Lake Silence, a continuation of the same world with different main characters. My first shock was that the main character is nothing like I thought she was going to be. Next, the main three characters are all human. So different than life in the Lakeside Courtyard!

When a woman named Vicki DeVine obtains a property, The Jumble in Lake Silence as part of her divorce, she pours all of her energy, resources, and money into fixing the resort to open it up to the public. Now, the property is in a town not controlled by humans but by the Others. Vicki has been careful about following the rules and so far she only has one guest, Aggie Crowe. Soon after, Vicki discovers that Aggie is not human. When a dead body is found close to her place, and detectives come asking questions, Vicki's anxiety and distress escalate. Thankfully, she will get the help of many new friends: humans and non-humans too.

I was completely lost in the story. I loved Vicki, her sense of humor, her innate understanding of how to handle the Others without trying. In a way, she exudes the same innocence that Meg had. As with Meg, the Others take an unusual interest in Vicki and her protection becomes a priority.

""he was so yummy. And really, what's a pint or two of blood between a girl and her attorney when she gets to have her neck nibbled by that mouth.""

What was not to like? I enjoyed it all! Love the new characters and the plotline. In the end, Julian Farrow, Officer Wayne Grimshaw, Aiden, Robert ""Cougar"" Panthera, Conan Bearguard, Ilya and Natasha Sanguinati, Ineke Xavier and her family, The lady of the Lake, the ponies, all contributed to the success of the story.

I wanted the Others to grab the bad humans and destroy them. Yes, I was clamoring for the Terra Indigene type of justice.

""So they're what, the world's hitmen?

I'm dying to read the next book in this series. I hope a year goes by fast.

But the world of Thasia as created by Anne Bishop is much larger than Lakeside and she has chosen to write about another part of the continent, after the terra indigene had wiped out a large number of humans.  The location is Lake Silence, the smallest of the Finger Lakes.  Vicki Dane has won an assortment of cabins and an old house in a divorce settlement and is trying to restore them to the point they can be rented to tourists.  Vicki is a fascinating character, on the one hand, a terrified mouse, wrecked by the verbal abuse of her ex-husband and his ""Vigorous Appendage"", and yet naturally very funny and eventually admirable.  She is beset by human villains and protected by a variety of the terra indigene, prominently by Ilya Sanguinati, a Crow,an Intuit, and a human cop. (If you have not read the first four in the series I recommend doing so.) This book is not as satisfying as the others were, mainly because the reader never sees herself in any of these characters.

28644,901,3854,"Remember Donny and Marie? ""I'm a little bit country I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll?"" Devlin Haskell, PI, is a little bit 30s noir detective and a little bit 21st century screwup. Modern noir sometimes uses throwback technology to set the scene. Mike Faricy gives Dev Haskell all the modern gadgets, but sets the mood with sharp language.

RUSSIAN ROULETTE is a well written mystery/thriller that includes the private eye and his cop buddy, interfering Feds, booze, and women. Yes, let us not forget the women.

I'm not one to give away the farm while reviewing. If you want that, read the blurb. Faricy sets the stage for the books to come without actually giving away too much about Devlin. It is suggested in the blurb that followers of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series will enjoy this book. Ms. Plum has several traits that follow her through the books. I am reserving judgement on this until I have read more books in this series because the one thing that stands out about Stephanie (in my mind anyway) does happen to Dev.

28645,2095,3841,"Bah! I read The Convents Secret way too fast. I swear, one minute I opened my Kindle to read and the next, I was done. Now I have to wait until the next book comes out. There has to be a legit word or group of words that describes these flu-like symptoms a reader gets during the wait between books in a series.

Series sickness maybe? When is the next darn book coming out syndrome?

Of course, C.J. Archer ended this addition of the Glass and Steele series with a moment that had me giddy as a girl and freaking livid, almost ugly crying, that it was over.

For me, The Covents Secret read differently than the others. There wasn't nearly as much action and adventure, but the story seemed more solid. I think its because I felt the other ones had scenes and dialogue that really didn't need to be there; it was extra fun stuff to read. This one didn't have those scenes; every single scene felt like it belonged. I enjoyed it immensely.

28651,1803,2595,"Have you ever sat and worried about the effect of GMO's - Genetically Modified Organism's? Have you ever wondered what it would be like if the only people alive were themselves GMO's? Ok, neither have I. But that really is the premise of Adrianne Finley's magnificent novel YOUR ONE & ONLY.

As all human beings on earth were dying of The Slow Plague, a group of scientists and researchers established a community in a remote part of Costa Rica where a group of genetically modified clones survived. Nine different proto-human types were cloned in generations of 10--each identical replications of the other. They lived and developed in peace--evolving through the careful process of modifying the genetic code of each successive generation to make more perfect examples of Homo Factus--the self made humans.

So the question is: what might happen when the same genetic material is used over and over again in each successive iteration for 300 years? What degradations of the genetic code might occur? Add into this the addition of an artificially created fully human being named Jack, and you have the crisis that makes up the story's plot. And then Jack--a human--develops a deep connection with one of the clones--Althea-310.

The question Adrianne Finley addresses in this poignant novel is: what is it that makes you and I human? Is it merely the genetic coding within our cell structure, it is it something more. Over the course of the novel we discover a Jack who demonstrates the uniquely human capacity to empathize, the demonstrate mercy and compassion, and ultimately to love.

This wonderful novel is categorized as a Young Adult novel, but it should not be pigeonholed too quickly. This book offers a chance to look at our 21st Century through a new lens, asking ourselves--as Sam and Inga did (Jack's ""parents""): What is it that we in our own society have lost? And what ought we to be trying much harder to rediscover.

I am much richer for having read this book, and recommend it highly to anyone who will pause long enough to listen to me praise it!

Thanks, Dr. Finley, for sharing your blood, sweat, and creative juices to create this novel.

28655,700,3689,"Enlightenment is a book in two parts. One, which is nearly the first 90% of the book, is the less interesting, less important, but the most impactful is the one that had to be written, while the other - the last 10% on Humanism - is the one that has to be read! The two have tenuous connections, despite the authors best efforts. Overall, the book contains much that is obvious and some unbearably blue-sky, but for its balanced tone, nuggets of information all through, the section on humanism in the end and most importantly, the sheer positivity, it is a worthwhile read.

The author starts with an important point: our daily news is all about whatever that does not work. The din of such reports feeds a widespread paranoia of humanity heading towards one or the other disaster. The book lists dozens of all-important aspects of life quality where there is nothing but relentless improvement in the last few decades or centuries. Data of all kind is blasted at the reader to brush aside any possibilities of counterarguments. In the process, points mentioned are more often than not extremely obvious, although the author does take a strong positive stand on certain controversial aspects too. These sections also include some good theories and arguments, albeit in the authors consistent, factual style rather than many other popular book writers. For example, Nasim Taleb would make tall claims about the concept of ergodicity, something he feels he has invented, to refute that income inequality is a rising problem. Mr Pinker, pronounced as someone Mr Taleb cannot stand, would arrive at the same conclusions on inequality not being a problem with four powerful points but none with any fancy titles. One of the four, which is apparently used by many academics for decades, is ergodicity in all but name.

While the author is reasonably balanced most of the times while countering the dissenting theories, he allows himself to be blindsided by his pre-decided favourable opinions about the progress as well. For example, the author makes valid points on how past doomsday forecasts of peak stuff have never been proven true. Yet, he is far too rational to really take that as any evidence of somehow this will never happen in future as well. For someone who knows that progress is not preordained, it should not be difficult to appreciate the value of fears. More often than not, we have conquered many diseases, disasters, wars and other societal issues simply by imagining their nightmare unfolding, leading to few from somewhere in the system arriving at the best solutions. As the author said, it is the higher vigilance - in response to the fears of terrorism-related events or crimes - that has led to a sharp reduction in crime. Yes, inequality may not be as bad as some believe, or pollution might be curable, but none of these problems is going to be sorted if everyone decides to simply count the positives.

Despite some great data, and a chest-thumping positive assessment of humanitys progress - topics that are making the book wildly famous - the books best sections are towards the end on the philosophy of humanism. Philosophers and intellectuals have historically fallen into two traps: a. Over-philosophising metaphysically while completely missing the practical or ontological parts, thus needlessly complicating even the simplest of aspects of morality or ethics and b. Focusing too much on the perceived or real, generalised or specific ills without recognising the continuous progress humans make. The authors call for the reason to rule, science to guide, our innate humanity to drive is powerful, even if simplistic. In fact, the naivety in the authors optimism is both the books biggest strength and its biggest weakness. It allows the book to take a tack that makes the book unique and feel-good. But, it also makes the author sweep far too many real issues under the carpet in the most callous fashion. One such example is the way the threat posed by faster machines is handled in less than a few statements by simply announcing that they cannot have any purpose (which is even more galling given the books later sections on physicality of concepts like soul, mind or conscience)

In sum, a good book.",1520467200,4,enlighten book two part one nearli first 90 book le interest le import impact one written last 10 human one read two tenuou connect despit author best effort overal book contain much obviou unbear blueski balanc tone nugget inform section human end importantli sheer posit worthwhil read author start import point daili news whatev work din report feed widespread paranoia human head toward one disast book list dozen allimport aspect life qualiti noth relentless improv last decad centuri data kind blast reader brush asid possibl counterargu process point mention often extrem obviou although author take strong posit stand certain controversi aspect section also includ good theori argument albeit author consist factual style rather mani popular book writer exampl nasim taleb would make tall claim concept ergod someth feel invent refut incom inequ rise problem mr pinker pronounc someon mr taleb cannot stand would arriv conclus inequ problem four power point none fanci titl one four appar use mani academ decad ergod
28656,652,1460,"It Can't Happen Here was published in 1935, but much of what it contains echoes today. Consider the rousing oratory that opens the book where a man addressing a small town group declares, ""We don't want all this highbrow intellectuality, all this book learning."" Thus rose out of this anti-intellectual sentiment is the populist Presidential candidate Buzz Waldrip, and his Svengali and Rasputin Lee Sarason, who secretly believed the country should be, ""now only in resolute control by a small oligarchy.""

With campaign promises of ""the 'Share the Wealth' and 'Every Man a King' proposals of the late Hon. Huey Long to assure every family $5000 a year..."", Waldrip soundly defeated his opponent Walt Trowbridge at least partially because Trowbridge, ""suffering from the deficiency of being honest and disinclined to promise that he could work miracles, was insisting that we live in the United States of America and not some golden highway to Utopia.""

What happened next was predictable in its general direction, but Lewis gave us specifics of the brutality that still somehow shocked. Minorities (Jews, blacks, women, etc.) were marginalized because, ""Every man is a king so long as he has someone to look down on."" Then there were the book burnings, killings, beatings, concentration camps, and more.

The protagonist, Doremus Jessup, eventually became entangled in the shady, pitiless, and savage world, and when his home was ransacked looking for contraband and seditious materials, his former friend, Emil Staubmeyer, said, ""Just orders--you know--just orders."" Remember: this is 1935, long before the foot soldiers of the Third Reich gave their answer, ""I was just following the orders.""

It Can't Happen Here is horrifyingly prescient. The writing was crisp, the characters well-developed, and the pacing was good. It was, at times, simultaneously difficult to read and impossible to put down. Perhaps a book like this remains relevant because people never really change. It serves as a reminder of how following leaders with their empty promises leads to ruin.",1520467200,5,cant happen publish 1935 much contain echo today consid rous oratori open book man address small town group declar dont want highbrow intellectu book learn thu rose antiintellectu sentiment populist presidenti candid buzz waldrip svengali rasputin lee sarason secretli believ countri resolut control small oligarchi campaign promis share wealth everi man king propos late hon huey long assur everi famili 5000 year waldrip soundli defeat oppon walt trowbridg least partial trowbridg suffer defici honest disinclin promis could work miracl insist live unit state america golden highway utopia happen next predict gener direct lewi gave u specif brutal still somehow shock minor jew black woman etc margin everi man king long someon look book burn kill beat concentr camp protagonist doremu jessup eventu becam entangl shadi pitiless savag world home ransack look contraband sediti materi former friend emil staubmey said ordersy knowjust order rememb 1935 long foot soldier third reich gave answer follow order cant happen horrifyingli prescient write crisp charact welldevelop pace good time simultan difficult read imposs put

28674,2944,3752,"Who is Polly? She's turned up in the small town of Bellville outside of Baltimore with only a suitcase and shoulders still freshly charred from the sun. She is staying in a dilapidated motel across from the equally ramshackle Hi-Ho bar. Naturally, the citizens of the small town are curious about who she is. Polly sits at the bar and announces to the man next to her, another out of towner, that Bellville is her new home. But why is she here and what has she left behind?

Adam knows what Polly, Pauline as he knows her, is running from. He watched as she spend a final day on the beach with her husband and three-year-old daughter. His client tasked him with cozying up to the husband and getting to know the family. The goal was to uncover the money that Polly illicitly gained from his client. Things did not go as planned. Polly fled in the night leaving her family behind. Now as Adam sits next to her at this dive bar in the middle of nowhere, he has more questions than answers about the woman his is supposed to investigate.

I've been a fan of Laura Lippman for years. Specifically, I've always admired her ability to craft stand-alone thrillers that draw me in and have unique characters. Even better, no two Lippman novels follow the same formula. In her latest novel Sunburn, Lippman presents a story that is so different from her others that I almost forgot which author I was reading. Even if my final reaction to the book was mixed, I have to applaud her effort in presenting something so unique.

Set in the early 1990's Sunburn is a mystery in all aspects. We are left in the dark about Polly and her motivations for most of the novel. Lippman strategically reveals details about Polly's past with just enough regularity to keep the reader invested in the story and the suspense rolling. Setting the story at the end of the last century gives the novel a retro vibe that also helps to explain how Polly is able to conceal her history so well. Without prevalent smart phones, social media, and computers, it is not easy for Adam and his client to learn about their enigmatic target. My only real complain about Sunburn is that the ending was a bit too abrupt and tidy for the events that preceded it. Still Sunburn is the perfect start to my early spring/summer reading and a solid reminder of Laura Lippman's writing prowess.",1520467200,4,polli she turn small town bellvil outsid baltimor suitcas shoulder still freshli char sun stay dilapid motel across equal ramshackl hiho bar natur citizen small town curiou polli sit bar announc man next anoth towner bellvil new home left behind adam know polli paulin know run watch spend final day beach husband threeyearold daughter client task cozi husband get know famili goal uncov money polli illicitli gain client thing go plan polli fled night leav famili behind adam sit next dive bar middl nowher question answer woman suppos investig ive fan laura lippman year specif ive alway admir abil craft standalon thriller draw uniqu charact even better two lippman novel follow formula latest novel sunburn lippman present stori differ other almost forgot author read even final reaction book mix applaud effort present someth uniqu set earli 1990 sunburn mysteri aspect left dark polli motiv

28676,378,3826,"His Risk by Shelley Shepard Gray is the fourth novel in The Amish of Hart County series.  Calvin Fisher left Horse Cave, Kentucky when he was fourteen years old and has done many questionable acts.  Calvin is now an undercover informant for the DEA.  He gives them intel on the Kings, a gang who commits illegal acts.  Calvin has worked his way up the ranks to get close to West Powers, the president of the organization.  Calvin receives a phone call from his sister-in-law, Waneta Fisher.  Mark, his brother, has renal cell carcinoma in his right kidney and will be undergoing surgery.  Calvin needs to return home to Hose Cave to be there for his brother.  But Calvin needs to ensure that trouble does not follow him home.  Alice, an Amish preschool teacher, is housesitting for her brother, Ed while he and his wife are vacationing in Pinecraft.  She is on the front porch when Calvin arrives.  The pair are drawn to each other, but Calvin does not feel he is good enough for Alice.  Alice knows she should avoid Calvin since he is Englisch and has had a troublesome history.  As they spend time together, their feelings grow.  One night, Alice is walking home, when a car goes by her slowly several times.  The next morning, the car is found abandoned and on fire.  Then the preschool is broken into and many of the items inside destroyed.  Calvin fears that the incidents are related to him and his connection with the Kings.  Alice begins to wonder how well she really knows Calvin.  Who is behind the incidents?  Can Calvin keep Alice safe?  Come along to Hart County and get to know Alice and Calvin in His Risk.

His Risk is a compelling romantic suspense novel that is well-written with interesting characters.  I like the authors writing style.  The story has a steady pace and smooth transitions.  His Risk is told from Calvin, Alice, Irene and Wests perspective.  I like being able to discover how each character was feeling and thinking.  Her characters are realistic with their doubts, struggles, and flaws.  Alice was a strong, smart spunky woman with an inquisitive nature.  Calvin has a danger and mystery about him which attracts Alice.  While His Risk is the fourth book in the series, it can be read alone.  Do not be surprised, though, that after reading His Risk you want to pick up the other three novels in the series.  His Risk is a story about forgiveness.  Forgiving of others and oneself.  Other Christian elements include trusting God, power of prayer, having strong faith and following Gods path for your life.  There is an issue of a parent abusing a small child in the book.  I was glad to see Irene stand up to the bully, but I was puzzled by Alices handling of the situation. I hope we get to find out more about Irene in future books in the series. I enjoyed watching the characters grow in character and faith as they faced adversity.  The four characters learn valuable lessons along the way.  His Risk is an emotional novel with danger, mystery and romance.

28677,2133,3826,"Amazing! Another amazing novel and addition to the Amish of Hart County series. To date, I think this is her best one yet in the series, though I did love all of them. Ms. Gray, whose talent has always intrigued me, wrote a novel that pulled me instantly to the center of the story with Calvin and his life. I fell head over heels instantly with him and loved following his risky story.

When Ms. Gray introduced me to Alice, yet another character to fall in love with, I knew this book would be one I would be up long into the night reading. I was right. Seeing Alice with the kinner in her class, then watching her fight her feelings for Calvin, really tugged at my heart through the story!

This is definitely a 5 star worthy novel in this series. The ups, downs, twists, and turns that Ms. Gray add to this absolutely inspirational novel of risking all for love, is wonderful and keeps the reader hooked. I can't wait for the next and final book in the series to get back to Hart County and see what Ms. Gray gives us next. Hats off and twenty thumbs up to a talented author on this one!

28682,3854,3829,"World leaders have called a state of emergency between humanity and the environment. A plan called the Europa Mission is created to send young men and women to terraform Jupiter's moon in the hope of developing a future home for mankind.

Leo is a survivor of a catastrophic flood in Rome that took his entire family. It is one of many recent apocalyptic disasters affecting cities all over the earth. After losing everyone and everything he cared about, he's lost motivation to go on. However, he's been drafted by the European Space Agency (ESA) to train alongside twenty-three other teens at the International Space Training Camp (ISTC). Only six of them will be selected to take part in the mission to colonise Europa.

Leo believes this will be a chance for him to do something important with his life. While he is excited for the opportunity, Naomi, an American high school student, has a completely different outlook. She has a family and doesn't want to leave them behind, especially her younger brother who she is very close to. She is devastated to have been chosen and horrified by the thought of never seeing them again.

Picked for her scientific genius, Naomi is particularly worried about the logistics of the trip. She questions a delegate from NASA about the Athena - a previously failed mission to Mars, as well as rumours of intelligent life already existing on Europa. The delegate is quick with assurances that there is no cause for concern and tries to assuage Naomi's fears with explanations that sound rehearsed. There may be more to the Europa Mission than is being revealed.

There are many diverse characters in the book and they are thoughtfully written. They have unique abilities and skills which make them highly important to the ESA and the mission. Although Naomi and Leo have different backgrounds, they both come from close-knit and loving families. They have an immediate connection and build a relationship that is integral to the narrative.

The story is fast paced and suspenseful. It depicts tragedy, heartbreak and hope amidst cataclysmic events and the high tech setting of the ISTC. The protagonists are in an unpredictable situation and must take dangerous risks which could lead to either dire consequences or the survival of the human race. The Final Six revolves around a profound and currently relevant subject.

28684,469,3829,"A few years back I read Alexandra Monir's Timeless series and fell in love with the world she created. So it's no surprise that I loved The Final Six, the first book in Alexandra's new series. Combining secrets, life-and-death stakes, and romance, The Final Six is an enthralling journey from start to finish.

The setting and world building were two of the most fascinating parts. I appreciated the level of detail Alexandra put into describing the storms, the challenges the world faced because of them, and the training camp. The setting was eye-opening, chilling, and even a tad stomach churning, because while our climate change isn't nearly this bad yet, it could very well be this bad in the coming years. Honestly, books like these should be a wake-up call.

The Final Six introduces Leo and Naomi, two teenagers from opposite sides of the world brought together by the International Space Training Camp. Leo and Naomi are strong, tactful, and passionate. I found them likable as well as relatable. I also liked that they both had such different feelings towards the training camp and the possibility of being part of the final six.

From the start, Leo wants to be picked. He views it as his second chance, and the thought of not being picked, of being forced to return to his country, makes him even more determined to come out on top. I admired his ambition and positivity. I also loved that while he wanted to win, he didn't distance himself from his teammates. His friendship with his roommate was one of my favorite parts of the book.

Naomi, on the other hand, views being chosen as a death sentence. She doesn't want to be torn away from her family. She also doesn't like the risks the camp is willing to take to make this new planet home. Something doesn't feel right to her, and she's determined to find out the whole story. I'll admit that Naomi's constant stirring of the pot got on my nerves; however, I also could understand why she was so desperate to find out answers, to challenge everything. I'd probably be the same way in her situation, and I did give her props: the girl had some major guts.

The Final Six mostly focuses on setting up the world as well as the training and final selection for the mission. Everything starts of a little slow, because Alexandra does spend a decent amount of time setting up everything, but it never felt boring or nonessential. The training camp provided so many thrills and chills. I loved all the science parts, and I also liked the different authority figures presented. Some of their actions were so incredibly shady, and I was constantly questing their motives.

The only aspect that I didn't outright love was the ending. It felt somewhat rushed and I didn't like how perfectly everything aligned. Don't get me wrong, I was happy with the outcome, but it just didn't seem ""realistic.""

Regardless, The Final Six is an enjoyable series opener, and given the emphasis on climate change, it's also a timely book.",1520467200,4,year back read alexandra monir timeless seri fell love world creat surpris love final six first book alexandra new seri combin secret lifeanddeath stake romanc final six enthral journey start finish set world build two fascin part appreci level detail alexandra put describ storm challeng world face train camp set eyeopen chill even tad stomach churn climat chang isnt nearli bad yet could well bad come year honestli book like wakeup call final six introduc leo naomi two teenag opposit side world brought togeth intern space train camp leo naomi strong tact passion found likabl well relat also like differ feel toward train camp possibl part final six start leo want pick view second chanc thought pick forc return countri make even determin come top admir ambit posit also love want win didnt distanc teammat friendship roommat one favorit part book naomi hand view chosen death sentenc doesnt want torn away famili also doesnt like risk camp
28685,1395,2408,"I'll Be Your Blue Sky is the sequel I never knew I wanted. I adore the first two books in this trilogy and was a little scared about reading about a grown-up Claire, especially one who was no longer with Dev. The book is actually the story of two women- Claire, now grown up and engaged to a man that, let's be honest, she never should have been with in the first place, and Edith, a nurse in the 1950s who owns a beautiful home on a beach in Delaware. Their stories are separate but carry a similar theme- home isn't always a place, but rather a person. Claire learns to navigate her own life while trying to solve the mystery of Blue Sky House, while Edith learns to navigate her life after tragedy strikes.

This novel is a beautiful story with an amazing depth that speaks to the heart of relationships and the power of choosing your own destiny.

28688,2147,2838,"Opening with a heart wrenching prologue, If I Die Tonight by Alison Gaylin is a spellbinding mystery about a carjacking that leads to the hit and run of a popular high school student.

Jackie Reed is a single mom raising her  two sons, seventeen year old Wade and thirteen year old Connor, in the small town of Havenkill, NY. Over the past several months, Wade has drastically changed and he is now secretive and a bit of  a loner. Despite these changes in her son, Jackie has complete confidence her son would not do anything to harm anyone. However, suspicion falls on Wade following the carjacking that leaves her sons classmate, popular and well-liked Liam Miller in a coma. Jackie never wavers in her faith that Wade has nothing to do with what happened to Liam, but the other people in their small town are not as willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Police Officer Pearl Maze is on duty the night Amy Nathanson, a washed up musician, reports her vintage Jaguar has been carjacked. She is also a witness in the accident in which Liam was struck by the car thief, but Pearl has doubts about her story. When Pearl uncovers information that proves her intuition is correct, Amy revises her explanation, but is she telling the truth?

Jackies belief in Wade is never shaken but she is frustrated by his refusal to tell her where he was the night of Liams accident. She is already concerned by a puzzling text that was sent to him but she also wants to respect his privacy.  But as the situation becomes more dire since everyone in town is out of blood and Wade is the easiest target, will Jackie try to find answers to the questions that are troubling her about her son?

Younger brother Connor is also deeply affected by the unfolding events. The antipathy toward Wade spills over onto Connor and he is forced to deal with bullies and out of control gossip fueled by social media. He wants to protect his brother and when he becomes a social pariah, Connor makes a decision that he immediately regrets but is unable to take back.

Written from multiple points of view,  If I Die Tonight is a slow burning yet incredibly engrossing mystery. The characters are richly developed and multi-dimensional. The storyline is quite riveting and realistic.  While some elements are somewhat easy to figure out, Alison Gaylin does an outstanding job keeping the truth about who is responsible for what happened to Liam and the perpetrators identity cleverly under wraps until the novels conclusion. A suspenseful and fascinating novel that fans of the genre are sure to enjoy.

She wasn't desperate to marry and in fact was wary of relinquishing her autonomy due to those blasted legal rules that subjugate married women to chattle.

28697,1846,3315,"Charles Krauthammer is one of the bright lights of political commentary today.  He has written a Washington Post column since 1985, for which he won a Pulitzer Prize, and appears on Fox News as a commentator.  In Things That Matter: Three Decades of Passions, Pastimes, and Politics, he has collected a variety of his columns and other writings, giving a nice glimpse into his thinking.

As the subtitle suggests, these columns span three decades, so a few of them seem dated, but for the most part he has selected writing that stands the test of time.  For example, he writes about Winston Churchill, on whom the 20th century hinged.  Krauthammer praises Churchill's traditionalism: ""It took a 19th-century man--traditional in habit, rational in thought, conservative in temper--to save the 20th century from itself.""

Another figure from history who gets a bad rap: Columbus.  In spite of the obvious problems of conquest, ""after 500 years the Columbian legacy has created a civilization that we ought not, in all humble piety and cultural relativism, declare to be no better or worse than that of the Incas.  It turned out better.  And mankind is the better for it.  Infinitely better.""

Several of the essays are very personal, such as his tribute to his brother and his praise for baseball.  Others are more in depth, such as an extended essay on embryonic research.  All are thoughtful and thought provoking.  Yeah, it's a lot to take in on a wide array of topics.  Things That Matter is probably best enjoyed as originally written, reading one column a day, like in the Post, rather than straight through.

28704,1279,39,"The first in a trilogy I am eager to read more of, Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach Trilogy begins boldly with ANNIHILATION.

I still have yet to see the film version, yet have read nothing but stellar reviews.  One thing I can piece together is that Alex Garland's film seems to have much more action and potentially a different ending.  Not a bad thing, as this novel is very introspective and haunting.  What I found most original about the novel is the fact that none of the lead characters use their proper names, just their titles.  For instance, the narrator is 'the biologist'.

There could be a number of reasons for this.  Perhaps the coolest and most chilling is that the current characters are members of the 12th team about to go on the expedition into the unknown and alien territory that has settled on our planet that is referred to merely as 'the shimmer'.  The previous expedition, those who survived, all came back very 'different' and were dead within in weeks of returning. In fact, there is only one living member of any prior expedition this being the biologist's husband.  Being a sci-fi geek and astute reader, I knew that the husband might not really be the same person who left for the eleventh expedition.

Whatever is going on in the portal world the shimmer --- breached only by the appropriately named Tower --- is something out of either a Kubrick film or H.P. Lovecraft story.  The fact that nothing much is explained in the novel makes it that much more intriguing to dive into the rest of the trilogy.

The wealthy grandmother hires PI Alice Vega, who, in turn, partners with ex-cop Max Cap Caplan. Although the police are investigating the case, they don't seem to be getting anywhere so the Feds (one agent, it seems) are brought in. Eventually, all teams work together to find the girls before its too late.

I managed to snag a copy of this book from my local library. Id heard some good things about it and was excited to read it. For the most part, I enjoyed the book. The story was intriguing, but slowed here and there.

The biggest issue I had was with Vegas character. There was a certain amount of backstory given, but not quite enough to make me understand her tough as nails exterior. She seemed too one-dimensional to me. As some other reviewers have mentioned, there was an air of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo about this book  same lone wolf female with a hacker friend she could rely on for Intel, with a law enforcement sidekick at the ready.

I liked Caplans character much more than I did Vegas character. I found him more relatable. I enjoyed the relationship he had with his daughter  even if she seemed to be too good to be true as far as sixteen-year-old girls goa little too perfect in my opinion.

I could have done without the odd romantic thoughts both Vega and Caplan seemed to have about each other at inappropriate timeswhat the heck was that about?

There were A LOT of characters in this book, which made it slightly difficult to keep track of everyone. I had an inkling about who the kidnapper was pretty much right away. I just didn't get the why. When all was revealed, it seemed a little too thin and farfetched, but not terribly so.

28713,1273,3632,"All the Beautiful Girls is a historical fiction story about a young woman who escapes her horrific childhood to become a dancer in Las Vegas during the 1960s. Lilys parents and sister were killed in a car accident when she was 6 years-old, and she is taken in by her aunt and uncle. Her aunt is cold, and her uncle is abusive, but she finds an unlikely benefactor in the man who was driving the vehicle that killed her family. He pays for her dance lessons and sends her many books.

Lily re-invents herself as Ruby Wilde when she gets to Vegas, and she quickly realizes that her dream of being a dancer won't happen. A few new friends and an honest scout convince her that the real money comes from being a show girl. Thus begins a grand adventure.

This book was quite entertaining. Ruby is a strong woman who uses her talents to build a better life for herself. There are some tragedies though, but I have to say I was satisfied by the ending of this novel. The content is a little racy at times, so be prepared.

28714,16,444,"Meg is hot-tempered and awkward at school. The only person who seems to really understand her is her odd youngest brother, Charles Wallace. He is exceptionally intelligent and eloquent for his age, but then, both of their parents are brilliant physicists. His father, however, Charles Wallace has never met. Sent away on a government program doing no one knows exactly what, Dr. Murry has been gone for many years, and most people whisper that he abandoned their family. But one dark and stormy night, a visitor appears at the familys door, a haggard woman named Mrs Whatsit, dressed in very eccentric clothing, who has already befriended Charles Wallace. She seems to be somewhat telepathic, and cryptically tells Mrs. Murry just before leaving that there is indeed such a thing as a tesseract.

Charles Wallace decides he and Meg must pay a visit to the haunted house a few miles down the road, where Mrs Whatsit has been hiding, along with her friends Mrs Who and Mrs Which. On the way there, they meet a boy named Calvin from Megs school who has the opposite problem as Meg, of forcing himself to fit in, and no one really understanding him. The three strange women inform the children that they are not from our world, that they know the Murrys father, and that he is in desperate need of their help. They will take the trio and help them wrinkle across time and space onto a new planet where dark forces are in power, ones that have been trying to destroy their father. Armed with cryptic advice and their minds, the group stop at the home planet of the three women for some nourishment of their bodies and souls, before they face the most alluring terrors, and seek out Mr. Murry and how to save him and the entire planet from the shadow.

Filled with humor, wisdom, and creativity, A Wrinkle in Time is for anyone who ever wondered about other planets or time travel, or any person, even adults, who was ever an awkward child, wishing their life was made for more than just fitting in. This book is the satisfaction of childhood dreams and curiosities, and teaches how we can all still fight the shadow, no matter our age.

28720,3936,2919,"If you're just getting started on this series, let me give you a time-saving suggestion. The early books are shorter and a breeze to read - a fun breeze. The later books become heavily laden with excessive description - one even describes the appearance of a handbag carried by a character who is only mentioned one time. After reading several of the books, I switched to downloading the audiobooks. As soon as a new character is introduced, I use the 15-second skip ahead feature on Libby (Overdrive) as many times as necessary to get to the point. I really don't care what the characters clothes look like. These aren't Carl Hiaasen novels where the characters are so humorous that describing a feral ex-Governor's beard strung with teeth, for example, adds to the fun. A suit is a suit and a tee shirt is a tee shirt. I don't need more details than that.

My other complaint about Ms. Grafton's writing is the limited vocabulary she relies on. Every book has multiple instances of the words ""gaze"" and ""tuck."" Gazes linger and are lowered. People ""tuck"" into seats (sometimes they ""slide""), ""tuck"" into food, and ""tuck"" items here and there. I'm not sure why an editor didn't encourage her to use a thesaurus.

Still, in spite of these flaws, the books are well-crafted mysteries that are very enjoyable.",1520467200,4,your get start seri let give timesav suggest earli book shorter breez read fun breez later book becom heavili laden excess descript one even describ appear handbag carri charact mention one time read sever book switch download audiobook soon new charact introduc use 15second skip ahead featur libbi overdr mani time necessari get point realli dont care charact cloth look like arent carl hiaasen novel charact humor describ feral exgovernor beard strung teeth exampl add fun suit suit tee shirt tee shirt dont need detail complaint m grafton write limit vocabulari reli everi book multipl instanc word gaze tuck gaze linger lower peopl tuck seat sometim slide tuck food tuck item im sure editor didnt encourag use thesauru still spite flaw book wellcraft mysteri enjoy

28726,3781,1139,"I started reading this book because my 12 year old son was reading it to do a book summary for school. I read the entire book in a 24 hour span. It may be somewhat of a mature book with typical thoughts and actions of a typical young teen and their bodily functions but it will probably be a good life lesson as well as moral lessons. Anyway...
What a great story, it is an emotional roller coaster. This book makes you laugh and cry, makes you feel bad for those on the rez but want to be a part of them and their tough life, makes you glad to be part of the white community and their privilege but embarrassed by our racism and how alone we are in a world full of people.
I want to write more but I do not want to give spoilers even if they are vague. I have a feeling that I will be thinking of this book often and will read it again in the near future.

28734,1551,3790,"I really enjoyed Hello Stranger. Ive been dying to know these characters better for a long time. Garrett is one of the first female doctors practising in England and she takes her job very seriously. Ethan is a detective/spy/undercover operative and he takes his job very seriously. Because their work is so important to them, they have both written off the opportunity to find their happy ever after with the one they love. Funny thing about attraction, though, sometimes it cant be denied.

Lisa Kleypas is one of my favourite historical romance authors. Her stories delight my senses and gives me the step back in time that I crave. Its obvious that she does her research and Im fascinated with her mix of facts with fiction. I will admit, there are times I think the heroine is a little too ahead of her times, but I guess, well never know if that is what women thought and felt back in the day.

I loved seeing the strength in both Garrett and Ethan. Garrett uses her mind and confidence in her abilities to show her strength. Ethan uses his physical strength and ability to blend in, to get the bad guys. Both Garrett and Ethan are admirable in their protection and healing of people. Station in life plays no part, they want everyone to be safe and healthy.

One of the highlights of Hello Stranger would have to be West Ravenel. His humour and kindness make him lovable and quirky.

I think I was more than generous giving 4 out of 5 stars for part 1 too. I love all legal thrillers because to me, law and all its technical stuff can be extremely interesting. But I wasn't thrilled by this first one. The title was misleading, there were other clients the lawyer had & they for damn sure were not innocent.

For a debut author I think Scott Pratt did a great job, but his characters were boring and completely one dimensional. I personally hate comparing other law thrillers, but thats how I read. It didn't leave a bad feeling, it just didn't have that I want more! The ending seemed like it was rushed too, like Mr. Pratt was in a hurry to end. I'm sure it was going into the next book, but endings can make or break everything you just read. So yes I was disappointed. Like I said Onward & Upward...Book 2.

28739,558,3830,"I am a big fan of this author. Having absolutely loved her previous two books, I was very excited to get an early review copy of this, her latest offering. As with all authors I love, I was a tad on the scared side as I started it. Would I love it as much as her other books? Would it live up to the already high standard I have her at? I mean, her first book I Let You Go is the book that I would most like to un-read and read again from cold (if you get what I mean)!
Anyway, cutting to the chase. Yep, enjoyed this one too. Not as much as I Let You Go or I See You as I thought this one was a little too busy, and a wee bit predictable, but a good solid read nevertheless.
Anna's parents both committed suicide. In the same way, at the same place, only a matter of months in between. In the days since their deaths Anna has found love, and has a young baby. She has never quite believed in the fact that her parents both took their own lives. Her mother especially being as how she knew how the death of her father affected Anna. She is certain there is much more to it than the police believe but no one is listening to her. When we first meet Anna, it is the first anniversary of her mother's death and she receives something through the post that unnerves her. Opening up old wounds that have never quite healed. Determined that the suicide ruling isn't the right conclusion, she throws caution to the wind to try to get the investigation opened again. Aided by ex-cop Murray who is now working on the desk in a civilian role, can she cut through the noise and get to the truth? However devastating that truth may be.
I've already said that this book is a little busy. It does seem to contain all the twists and then some which, for me, were a few too many. I think that the author has basically been earmarked as a twist specialist - well the one in her first book was sheer brilliance - and I think that she feels obliged to go bigger and better in every subsequent books she writes. Which is a pity really as her plotting, writing and characterisation really are good enough without having to resort to this kind of thing. There's also the inclusion of Murray's wife who is suffering from a mental health issue. Now, although this is handled really well in this book and actually made for some very good reading, I am not quite sure the reason for its inclusion. Certainly not a plot development point as far as I can see. Maybe just a distraction from the convoluted nature of the main narrative; I don't know. Although, that said, with statistics saying that something like 1 in 4 people suffer mental health issues, I guess by the law of averages... why not?
The characters were well drawn as usual and, within their roles, played their parts believably to perfection. Obviously with a book of this nature there are a lot of secrets, lies and duplicitous behaviour but it is the motivation behind all that that is key in this book. And although most of the motivation was justified, there were a couple of things that happened that didn't quite sit right with me.
All in all, although not her best book, this was a good solid read overall, which wasn't too taxing and which left me mostly satisfied at the end.

28749,1375,3832,"a Djinni may grant it. What an epic conclusion! Alwyn Hamilton is an incredible writer who weaves intense action with personal peril, overarching themes of what it is to be human  and not human, the lengths humans, Demdji, and Djinn will go for love and loyalty. Her prose varies from the intensely personal to a mythological storyteller looking back through the ages at the present day. In all that she engages us in the peril, the heartache, and the risk while she whips us about with dust and sand that rips our hearts apart.

This is a truly satisfying conclusion, but be prepared with a box of Kleenex, true love does not end with a kiss, and while many died in book 2, there are those we care about in book 3 who will live on only in memory. Prisoners are freed, traitors redeemed, lives won and lost, and the kingdom trembles in the balance. What is the price of triumph?

Myths are re-written, heroes resurrected, cities discovered and lost, Djinn released from the imprisonment of millennia.  Move aside or join the cause; legends walk among us as new stories are indelibly etched on the collective memory of a nation.

28750,899,3832,"My single teeny, tiny, minuscule complaint about TRAITOR TO THE THRONE had been that it was a little bit slow at some points. Maybe that was because the lead-up had been to this epic, exciting, and emotional finale. I completely fell in love with the world, characters, and setting all over again. There were adventures on ships, returning to pasts, legends, and painful sacrifices. I was definitely tearing up a little bit twice at the end. There were many twists and turns that had me internally screaming, but understanding why some choices were made. The entire book read like a fairytale, especially during the final chapter.

.
The timing of this day is perfect because just last night I finished the audiobook  A Curious Beginning  by Deanna Raybourn, which is not only written by a woman, but stars a strong female lepidopterist  by the name of Veronica Speedwell . Miss Speedwell is a woman who values her independence in the midst of a time when women were expected to be completely dependent. She studies butterflies, travels the world, and does whatever her heart desires. Not too far into the book, Speedwell finds herself attempting to solve the murder of an old baron with a new acquaintance by the name of Stoker. Soon they realize someone in her mysterious past might have been involved in the murder, and unknown family secrets start to unravel before her eyes. Eventually it becomes obvious that whoever killed the baron is also after Speedwell & Stoker. Can they put the pieces together in time to catch the killer and save themselves?

28753,2879,3830,"I am a huge fan of this authors books so did a bit of a happy dance when I found out she had a new one coming out.

The story flicks between different characters, this way we get to know more about each character. One of the characters we get to meet is Murray, a retired CID who takes it upon himself to investigate the suicides of Annas parents. He was someone who my heart went out to. His work is a demanding and stressful one and to be honest I couldn't see how his home one was any different. He lives in constant fear of his wife Sarah taking her own life. She has had many failed attempts and every time he leaves her alone, he doesnt know if that will be the last time that he will see her alive. It was so sweet to see how much he loves her as not many people could cope with living like that. Sarah my heart went out to also. She knows the constant strain her husband is put through but obviously cant control how she feels. I think overall the author did a great job in showing what living with mental health is like and it was very much heart breaking.

Anna has been left mixed up and confused by both her parents deaths. She cant understand why both would do this and is some what angry . She struggles to get her head round it like I think anyone would. By going to the police insisting that they didn't take their own lives, she opens a whole can of worms.

As always with this author, its hard to go to much into detail as after all this is the queen of the big twists. Let Me Lie is no different. There are a few twists and turns that will have you gasping out loud at what you are reading. A great read and am sure fans of the author won't be disappointed.

28756,1604,3860,"{My Thoughts}
What Worked For Me
Coming Out  Speak No Evil is many things, but at its heart is a boy, Niru, coming out to a girl, Meredith. The two had long been friends, had dated here and there, and Meredith very much wanted their relationship to be more than just friendship. Niru, afraid, but no longer able to stomach the pain his rejection caused Meredith, admitted to her that he may be gay. There was much to Nirus coming out, most of it painfully sad, but I loved the moment these two shared after his secret first emerged.

She holds me as she murmurs, Im right here. She says, Im with you. I start to cry. Im overwhelmed by the sound of my own pain. She tries to slow things down the way our track coaches slow us down. Count your breaths, Niru, she says. Follow my voice, Niru. And I follow for a moment, but my thoughts are strong and I choke on a mixture of relief, embarrassment, and fear. She pulls me closer and rocks with me. She drapes an arm over me and clasps my hand. She says, Ill always be here. I say, what do we do now?

Clash of Cultures  Niru, born in the United States, had for the most part led the life of any other privileged American teen. He went to an elite prep school, had already earned an early acceptance to Harvard, and enjoyed the usual circle of friends. Niru also appreciated many aspects of his Nigerian heritage. Both parents were born in Nigeria, but had immigrated to the U.S. to build very successful careers and give their two sons privileges they hadnt enjoyed. It seemed he had it all until his father discovered Niru was gay. To his parents being gay was an abomination that had to be exterminated at almost any cost. This clash of growing up in city, in a country where people need no longer be ashamed of homosexuality and a culture where it was completely unacceptable led the reader through a sad and powerful chain of events.

Dual Narrators  Speak No Evil has two narrators, Niru and Meredith, with Niru telling the bulk of the story and Meredith picking up the last third. Much of what happened to Niru in the first half of the story Meredith had little knowledge of and so couldn't speak to. After coming out to Meredith, Niru lost control in his life and to some extent blamed her. The middle of the book was exclusively Nirus story, but Meredith emerged again later and picked up Nirus journey as only she could. Both parts were told in first person which gave the entire story authenticity. From their own vantage points the themes of culture, sexuality, race and ultimately, friendship unfolded.

What Didnt
Formatting  Uzodinma Iweala, like many authors today, chose not to use quotation marks in his book which had quite a lot of dialogue in it. I am used to that now and it doesnt bother me nearly as much as it once did, but Iweala also didn't have line breaks in conversations. As an example, I didn't in any way change the format of the passage quoted above. The lack of line breaks sometimes made for difficult reading and seemed a little lazy.

{The Final Assessment}
Coming-of-age stories are one of my favorite genres, so Ive read many and am always on the lookout for those with a unique twist. A boy coming out in itself doesnt sound all that different, but Iwealas story truly was much more than Id expected. He packed a lot into a slim volume. Both heartbreaking and memorable, Nirus story is one I highly recommend. Grade: A-

The protagonist was born about the time that I was and tells the story of her time working at the US Robotics and Mechanical Men Corporation where she worked as a robo-psychologist until she retired into her 70s.  It traces the dawn of robots from being non-vocal nursemaids for human children, to being almost indistinguishable from people, to running the worlds economy by the end.  In the story she and her colleagues grapple with the problems that come about from the robots during each stage of their development.  The theme throughout is that all robots are built to follow three laws of robotics.  The first being that robots cannot harm people.  This book is nothing like the 2004 movie with Will Smith.

28772,1779,3399,"Once upon a time, Joe Oliver King was a cop. A good man with a few vices. One of those got the better of him, led him to be framed. He lost his family and several months of his life in solitary in Rikers. More than a decade past, King is a loner, a private eye whose teenager daughter helps him part time. One day, amidst his depression and brokenness, a letter arrives. In it, he sees a glimpse of hope. At the same time, his daughter has persuaded him to take on a second case: a reporter who's been accused of killing two cops. As King descends into the cases, he discovers a criminal side of himself that wants him to unleash the brutality he once experienced. Will he succumb? Or can a decent man who made a bad mistake find his salvation?

Let's get the flaws out of the way first: DOWN THE RIVER UNTO THE SEA is perhaps two novels in one. It's a little over 300 pages and is probably a hundred pages too long. Also, there's not much in the way of complexity; it's a pretty straight-forward plot, with a couple of small twists that don't really feel like nuclear blasts, perhaps just firecrackers. Okay. We done with that? Because if you've read any Walter Mosley novel, you know that those two things tend to be a common thread, and that they are not really any bother. Those extra hundred pages or so are pure character development. While the crime and mystery may be a draw, Mosley's staying power comes from his ability to wrench nuance and backstory from his characters. It's what helps sets him above his peers. Sure, DOWN THE RIVER may not be a masterwork, but it IS written by a master, and as such should be required reading.",1520467200,4,upon time joe oliv king cop good man vice one got better led frame lost famili sever month life solitari riker decad past king loner privat eye whose teenag daughter help part time one day amidst depress broken letter arriv see glimps hope time daughter persuad take second case report who accus kill two cop king descend case discov crimin side want unleash brutal experienc succumb decent man made bad mistak find salvat let get flaw way first river unto sea perhap two novel one littl 300 page probabl hundr page long also there much way complex pretti straightforward plot coupl small twist dont realli feel like nuclear blast perhap firecrack okay done youv read walter mosley novel know two thing tend common thread realli bother extra hundr page pure charact develop crime mysteri may draw mosley stay power come abil wrench nuanc backstori charact help set peer sure river may masterwork written master

28775,3175,3751,"Summary:

Sam Blue is standing trial for the murder of three young women.  Harriet knows Sam could never have done this. but shes the only one.  An altercation gets her banned from the trial and sent out to Last Chance Valley to investigate a possible planned attack on the populace of 75.

On her first day a homemade bomb kills the retired sheriff.  With the help of the only cop in Last Chance Valley and a terrorist agent, she must find out who is behind all this before anyone else is hurt and the only clue is a diary found in an abandoned backpack.

While she is out there, her friend and partner Whitt is trying to keep tabs on the trial and keep Sam safe behind bars.  When he is attacked outside the courthouse one day, help comes in the form of Tox- a detective that has worked with Harriet in the past.  The two could not be more different. but it may just be that together they can find the evidence needed to protect Sam for Harrys sake.

My thoughts:

I have to say that this is not my favorite series from Patterson.  It is near the bottom of the list, in fact.  I keep reading because I keep hoping it will find its stride and get better, like the RED series did.  Sadly the way this book finished, this could be the last book for Harrys series.  It would be a terrible wrap-up with far too many open ends. but its happened in the past and I cant find any chatter about another book.

I have mixed feelings about this book.  It is by far the best written of the series, but certain things were still far too predictable.  (Harry blows up and gets in trouble with her captain- gets shipped out to Middle of Nowhere, Australia. yeah, that happened in a previous book for this series.  Bear in mind there are only two books and a novella here.)  Whitt, a character I was beginning to like, is given more of a casual role here and instead of getting to know him better as a character a lot of time is spent on his observations on Tox.  Tox is an interesting character too, and I love him for his loyalty to Harry. but I prefer Whitt and was a bit saddened by his role here.  Harry is also a dilemma for me.  I need character growth- I want to watch them grow, root for them.  Harry hasn't had too much of that since I first met her.  She did have an aha moment near the end of the stay in Last Chance Valley where I felt like maybe there was hope; but the way the book ended it could go either way and, as I said before, there is no talk of another book.

All of that aside, I did enjoy getting to know the villain of this piece, and the fact that the current victim was given a voice as well.  The book was fast paced and definitely action packed.  I liked the nods to the previous books and characters, and the moments where Harry showed her more caring side.  She is a protector, fierce and loyal.  I can get behind that I just don't always want her bashing heads and fighting her way through trouble.  For me, this is a three and a half star book.  If there is more I will read it, if only for closure.
On the adult content scale, there is a lot of violence, cursing, and the occasional racial remarks.  Emphasis on violence.  There is also talk of child abuse of a sexual nature.  this could be a trigger.  I give it an eight.",1520467200,3,summari sam blue stand trial murder three young woman harriet know sam could never done she one alterc get ban trial sent last chanc valley investig possibl plan attack populac 75 first day homemad bomb kill retir sheriff help cop last chanc valley terrorist agent must find behind anyon el hurt clue diari found abandon backpack friend partner whitt tri keep tab trial keep sam safe behind bar attack outsid courthous one day help come form tox detect work harriet past two could differ may togeth find evid need protect sam harri sake thought say favorit seri patterson near bottom list fact keep read keep hope find stride get better like red seri sadli way book finish could last book harri seri would terribl wrapup far mani open end happen past cant find chatter anoth book mix feel book far best written seri certain thing still far predict harri blow get troubl

28783,4660,1507,"The Rizzoli and Isles books have been a series that Ive followed for some years now. I enjoy them, but I am fully aware that the quality is uneven. Unfortunately, I Know a Secret is one of Gerritsens off books. There are good ideas that went into this mystery. For example, the method behind the murders is the right kind of twisted. In a better book, it would have been chilling. Instead, the focus remains on an old mystery that isn't anywhere near as interesting as Gerritsen seems to think it is. Theres also a subplot with Dr. Isles mother that ultimately has no payoff at all. These distractions dilute the books good qualities.

On top of that, there are glaring plot contrivances. Rizzoli is repeatedly told that a project the first victim was working on was inspired by a painful episode from her past, yet she doesnt think to find out what this painful episode was until the book is nearly overand sure enough, its the key to solving the whole thing. I understand that Gerritsen couldn't give it away too soon (otherwise there would be no book), but the handling makes Rizzoli look ineptwhich she most definitely is not. Furthermore, theres a character who knows the identity of the killer, so theres really no mystery at all. Rizzoli only has to solve it because this character won't tell anyone (otherwise the title wouldnt make sense). Its shockingly clumsy plotting from Gerritsen, who is usually better than this.

There are treats for fansincluding the return of Father Daniel Brophybut theres no denying that the book feels like its only half trying.

28784,984,2910,"This is the first book in a new series of police procedural books featuring Detective Inspector Adam Fawley and his team. Even though there are a lot of books of this type, I found this particular team to be very interesting and I look forward to the future books in this series. One other interesting part of the book were the tweets from the general public that occurred several times in the book. As is now the case, the public has lots of opinions on cases like this and people who hide behind twitter and facebook often come up with some very bizarre theories.

Daisy has gone missing from a family party -- no one, not even her parents, really saw her at the party so no one had any clues for the police. In fact, her parents didn't even see her after school and can't be sure that she even came home from school. Even if you've read a lot of books about dysfunctional families - this one will be near the top of the scale. The parents were both obsessed with status and what other people thought about them and the 10 year old son was troubled but the police couldn't get him to talk. As the police try to find out what happened to Daisy and the public is condemning different people on social media, the secrets of the family are slowly revealed.

28785,2657,926,"This is a rites of passage book, a very sad story.  It is the story of a young girl trying to deal with life.  When the book begins, it is the year of 1964 in South Carolina.  Lily Owens is fourteen, her mother died when she was four, her father is mean, the lady who raised her,  Rosaleen, is black, wants to vote.  This is the reason the two get in trouble, especially Rosaleen.  The two run away, not quite knowing where they are going or what they are going to.. .

Lily has always wondered about her mother, she can barely remember the lady.  Lily has some possessions that had belonged to her mother.  There is the name of Tiburon, South Carolina among these things. The two decide to visit this place.  Possibly someone might know something about her mother.

The two arrive in Tiburon, find a big, bright, pink house, very noticeable.  The calendar ladies, May, June and August live in this house.  August is an earth mother who has many bee hives, makes wonderful honey, candles and many other honey products, which are shipped all over the country.  June, a history and English teacher in a black school, resents Lily for staying at the home of the sisters.  August has invited the runaways to stay.  May, too sensitive, worries about the problems of life.  Too much worrying.

The book tells readers about life, people should live their lives, enjoy life, don't mess up their lives.  People have a strength inside them to deal with life's happenings.  This book is a celebration of woman.  A group of black ladies are members of the Daughters of Mary, Jesus Mother.  The honey jars contain a portrait of dark skinned Mary.  Lily is obsessive about knowing about her mother, her childhood, her marriage, the woman she was, her love for her daughter.  How much she loved her daughter.

I like the calendar sisters, Lily is too much of a whiner, the sisters stand up to and deal with life.  It was hard for Lily's father after her mother left him, he had to get a neighbor lady to take care of his four year old daughter.  Lily throwing the jars of honey, smashing them, breaking them all over where they were stored before getting ready to be shipped, made me mad.

28796,2515,3840,"Hello, Hello!

Glad to be back in the Mercyverse with Charles and Anna again! It has been a while since Patricia Briggs gave us a new Alpha and Omega.... but better late than never, right?

Burn Bright's plot is an interesting one. For once, Charles and Anna are with the pack in Aspen Creek instead of having to go somewhere else to ""fix"" a problem. Charles is in charge of the pack while Bran is out of the country. Then, a distress call comes from the mate of one of the wildings. The couple is under attack and they're asking for the pack's help. Soon, the danger is closer to home and Charles and Anna are in a race to find the answer to the question of Who's behind the attacks on the pack?

So who are the wildings? The wildings are the more unstable and older werewolves who need/ have agreed to Bran's protection. They live in isolation from the rest of the pack. Some of them have a past full of pain and misery. There's a reason why Bran offers them sanctuary. However, if one becomes to too lost to his wolf then Bran won't hesitate to take care of the threat. Yet, this time, the threat comes from outsiders and since Bran is not available, Charles will have to deal with the mess.

Anna and Charles's relationship keeps on moving forward. Their mate bond is a strong one. They complement each other. Despite Charles being what he is, he's never overprotective. He doesn't overshadow her either. Anna is becoming a much stronger werewolf. She's becoming much more comfortable with her Omega side. She's not a victim and she doesn't want anyone to see her that way. Brother Wolf as always is just great. He can be quite scary but he also brings some needed levity at times.

Also, Patricia Briggs let us into a big revelation or at least it was to me. I'm pretty sure I was as clueless as Mercy was/is. Not sure if this information is going to affect the Mercy books. Why bring it up if there is no importance to it? Yet, I don't want Mercy to find out.

I love how we get more details in regards to Mercy's upbringing. She was a force to be reckoned with and I'm glad Charles helped her in whatever way he could.

Now to the whodunit part....I was with Charles with his suspicion but I was glad I was wrong. Nevertheless, it hurt to see the pack hurting with their losses.

Another surprise was Leah, someone who I thought (and might still think) is not the best choice of mate for Bran. Yet, in this installment, she was much more tolerable and even useful. If you don't think so, ask Charles.

Asil was one of my favorite secondary characters in Burn Bright. He can be funny but don't underestimate him. He can also be quite scary when he wants to be. He enjoys teasing Charles by using Anna but he loves Anna and would be there to protect her in a heartbeat.

One last thing, the cover of Burn Bright is amazing. Certainly a winner.

I do hope we don't have to wait three years for the next one and long live the Mercyverse.

I am only sad, now seeing that I have only two books left until either it ends or the waiting game starts. Considering the fifth book was just released this month, most likely the waiting game.

In this book, Anna is concerned because Charles has been having to act as the Marroks sword, killing werewolves who are out of line. Since coming out to the humans, Bran is not giving the wolves second chances and some of the kills are weighing heavily on Charles, and Anna seems to be the only one who sees it. She is scared of the torment Charles is inflicting on himself and he is not letting her share in his burden.

They are sent to help the FBI on a serial killer case, where three werewolves were among the most recent victims, but the killings have spanned several decades. Bran hopes that by giving Charles a chance to solve this and be a hero that his weight may be lessened.

28812,3686,3852,"Let me start by saying that Moning is one of my favorites, and I have loved the fever series.  I have read the books so many times I've lost count, paid for the audio versions and even the paper versions just so they are always handy.  There have been a few questionable turns along the way, certain points I respectfully disagree makes sense for the character(s) involved, but it has never totally turned me off; I trusted the author to get us to where we were supposed to be eventually, and the tension and buildup seemed worth it in the end. Things started getting a bit sketchy with the Dani portion of the series, especially the ""Jada"" storyline, but I was more than willing to pre-order this months in advance and still read the book in a day. I love Dani, and Ryodan, and was always hoping for a HEA for them.

As much as I enjoyed this book, however - and I did enjoy it - I can't say it lived up to the author's prior works.  More than the books before, this one gave the impression of rushing along, in ways that (respectfully) did not truly make sense to the characters, their prior backstories or development. Although there were some cute literary tricks that I admit I enjoyed, the plot holes and deviations remained ever-present and obvious throughout the book, making the overall book less than I believe it could have been. The primary antagonist was a mere afterthought to the ""development"" of Dani and Ryoden's relationship, with its motivations, backstory, and ultimate ""climax"" raced through in a handful of scenes, many of which jumped so fast from Point A to Point Z that one wonders why he was there in the first place. The ""lesser"" bad guy, appears in two scenes, is never explained, even to what the heck he supposedly did (besides the obvious), that again, it's not clear why he was there or what his real purpose was (particularly when a simple telephone call would have done the same thing as ""a god""). Then there's a handful of ""side plots"" involving Christian, Mac, Barrons, Jayne, Kat, Sean, and a couple of other minor characters which appear to have been introduced just so we didn't think that they all weren't still lurking around, but none of which actually appear to go anywhere.

The main disservice of this book, though, is that Dani and Ryodan's ""courtship"" falls flat in this book.  In the first Dani book, she's too young.  Problem ""solved"" in the second, where she disappears in the silvers for years and comes back ""old enough"" for Ryodan, only to have the whole Jada/Dancer issue.  In trying not to give any spoilers for this book, suffice to say Ryodan's actions (and frankly Dani's) the first several chapters of this book appear to run directly contrary to everything both characters have done and stood for in the past.  Moning has to get them back together again, though after yet another time jump (it's starting to feel like Moning is literally fast-forwarding through her own series at this point), so through unexplained acts, she does.  What happens thereafter happens so quickly, however, that it is like a switch being flipped - one minute they're this way, the next they're another. Couple that with the many holes with the ""Shazaam"" story-line (seriously, the whole ""mate"" thing was disgusting and creepy, plus what the hell does the eventual ""explanation"" do to the notion that Dani/Jada ""lost"" Shazaam in the second book, and don't EVEN get me started on the ""red string"" issue), and you have a book which, while overall entertaining, completely jumps the shark.

28813,135,3823,"Absolutely superb, no questions five glorious stars!

This spin off of the previous series (although still called The Others) centres on The Jumble, a small, slightly down-at-heel holiday home with 12 small chalets located just outside the village of Sproing, near Lake Silence. The owner, Vicki DeVine is a short, stubby woman (she isn't curvaceous, just solid) who received the Jumble in her divorce settlement. She has invested much of the remaining cash settlement in things like septic tanks and flushing toilets for the chalets.

Vicki only discovers that her single paying guest, a young girl called Aggie, is Crowgard when she discovers her trying to heat up an eyeball ready to eat! This leads her to discover the body of a murdered man on the edge of her land. What follows is part taut thriller, part urban fantasy and all good.

I can't even write a review because I just loved all of it. It was perfect. Loved all the characters (except the baddies - boo, hiss), loved The Others, loved Sproing. Loved it, loved it, loved it.

28815,2649,2961,"I am a HUGE fan of Joy Fielding. I have read all of her books, and I know that some I just LOVE and others - they are just ok for me, but still worth the read.  This was one that was just ok - and a bit of a disappointment.

I found the narrative was much too repetitive and almost bland. The book had a great premise and a terrific surprise, which was almost worth waiting for, but I felt there was too much description of everything -- the area, for example (Red Bluff - I know it like my own home town).  And Cassidy's dialog did not ring true to me, for a 12 year old girl.  And the phrases too oft repeated  (such as: ""Tara's beautiful face"" ....)

And then there's  Landon, too much of Landon - ""Do you think Landon could be guilty?""  ""Landon could never have done it.""  ""Is he really trying to frame Landon?""  ""Do you think she is safe with Landon.""  ""Where is Landon now?""  ""I followed Landon last night.""  I was totally over-Landon'ed  by the end of this one.

To me - It seemed to me like the author wasn't sure which way to go.  There is a lot of padding in this book while Fielding figures it out.

Of course, I will still read everything Joy Fielding writes because I have enjoyed so many of her books.

28816,84,2961,"Ballantine Books and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of The Bad Daughter.  I was under no obligation to review this book and my opinion is freely given.

Robin gets a distressing call from her sister Melanie, who has news that their father, his stepdaughter, and his wife have been shot at their home.  After her best friend Tara dumped Robin's brother to marry their father, Robin walked away from her town and never looked back.  Coming home to help wherever needed, Robin soon realizes that there are many questions surrounding the apparent home invasion.  Will her niece Cassidy be able to shed some light on what happened that awful evening?

Author Joy Fielding is a seasoned veteran of the mystery and suspense genre, crafting stories full of suspicious behavior, threats, and lies.  The Bad Daughter is no different, although this novel did not grab my attention as much as some of her others.  There were too many holes in the plot and too much of the book was focused on police guesswork instead of investigative clues.  The mystery was overly complex, as the author put forth a great deal of suspicion on too many characters to make it a cohesive story.  I was not a big fan of the main character, as her personal issues got in the way of the main premise behind the book.

28817,2386,3763,"While much of what the author provides in the first seven chapters of the book is spot on. For it is a fact that historically our foreign policies do indeed reflect a lack of understanding of the tribalism that takes place in nations we have dealt with in the past.

However when she transposes that understanding to tribalism within the US, as is done in Chapter Eight: Democracy and Political Tribalism in America, arguably, the most important chapter in the book, I believe she oversimplifies a much more complex problem.

Rather than tribalism within the US being just a white-on-black thing, the browning of America must take into account much larger, near systemic forces rarely discussed in polite American conversations. To wit:

In addition to elite tribes of other countries long since using the wealth earned at home to take advantage of our once world-class university system, now with the help of corporations in a race to the bottom of the global labor poor, they are now a;Lao aggressively taking up positions as American professionals.

These two unseen forces, whether intentional or not, now constitute what amounts to a new immigrant professional class, another browning that is a major part of our emerging professional labor force.

Thus the browning of the American labor force is no longer just a bottom-up affair, but also a top-down affair. That is, it is more than just a threat to lower-class whites, but as a recent 60-Minutes piece showed, it is also a threat to the American professional class, writ large.

Under such circumstances, one could argue that strategically imported cheap labor by US corporations to fill positions at both the top and bottom of our labor force, is a conscious and cynical effort to avoid paying more US taxes, and thus not continuing to pay for expensive university education for American citizens? For if such taxes were dutifully and patriotically paid, they would produce the skills needed at home, eliminating the need to import them.

Corporate attempts to reduce their bottom lines in order to increase CEO salaries and stockholder dividends at the expense of the American worker, has created its own tribal dynamic and backlash.

This strategic race to the bottom of the labor pool has produced tribal tensions all across Americas labor grid. And indeed has been ongoing in one form or another since Chinese coolies were imported in the 1840s, and the Mexican Bracero program of the 1960s.

However, while no one has been watching, this process has metastasized and now has expanded across most of the professional categories of the American labor force.

Imported professionals now constitute an emerging new professional middle-class, replacing what once was an all American (mostly all white) professional middle class..

As the 60-Minutes piece made clear, ignominiously, American professionals are now forced to train the very foreigners who move into their old offices to take their jobs at less than half their salaries and benefits?

What do these corporate-run labor substitutions have to do with American tribalism? Well, for one thing, they create resentment within the traditional American labor force.

Unfortunately, in this book, those resentments against this imported replacement professional class, have been reframed, conflated with and channeled into the traditional white-on-black tribal skirmishes.

But these corporate maneuverings  have nothing at all to do with Affirmative Action, or Political correctness, but everything to do with corporate greed and their failure to take a patriotic interest in the American work force. Other than that I like the book.

I think my primary issue is that I never really connected with Dani. Definitely found her annoying in earlier novels when she was young and the clumsy aging of her was just awkward. So, here we go again with yet another aging mechanism in this book so she would be in her twenties when she and Ryodan finally came together.

I feel like there was quite a bit of clumsy in this book. So much felt like filler instead of moving the story along. I knew I was only half interested in Dani's story when I felt more interested and engaged when Dani briefly encountered characters such as Christian and Barrons.

28820,573,1179,"If you have the years on you or simply enjoy pulling some older dusty books off the library shelves, you might remember older gothic-flavored romantic suspenses by Mary Stewart or Victoria Holt or Daphne DuMaurier.  I loved their writing that gave one a little chill, a harrowing adventure for a heroine, and a nice bit of legend or history altogether.  I say all that to share the fact that The Darklling Bride set in the mountains of County Wicklow, Ireland belongs in that illustrious group.

The Darkling Bride starts the reader in the present day when beginner scholar, Carragh Ryan, is invited to take a three-week temp job that is the job of her dreams- a chance to go to a real Irish castle and seat of the Gallagher family, catalogue the library, and maybe, just maybe find a lost manuscript by an intriguing Victorian novelist who was one of the great.

From there, Carragh discovers there is an unsolved murder from twenty years before and hints of a dark cursed history associated with Deeprath Castle and the Gallaghers.  The decision by Aidan Gallagher to put the castle and its contents into the hands of the National Trusts stirs up the past and now Carragh and Aidan must discover the secrets of the past to keep darkness from stirring once again.

There are flashbacks to two earlier time lines that help fill in what came before as answers are discovered one by one.  The author instilled a foreboding atmosphere and an eerie sense that the supernatural is close even though I was never sure about that.  Just like, when the family gathers, I was never sure who was innocent or guilty- or should I say, whose secrets were pertinent to the murders and castle secrets.  Even Carragh, a stranger in the midst has her secrets and ties to the family.

I enjoyed that several genre elements were present- gothic, suspense, romance, and historical fiction.  There are personal journeys that Carragh and Aidan and even the police officer are on to make peace with their own pasts, but also their budding interest in each other and, of course, the murders in the past.

There was a nice bit of local flavor, legend, and history, but it was organic to the story so that it never felt too much or distracting.  There is also a sense of connection and fun wink to several great romantic suspense writers from before so that the writing felt familiar even though this was my first time reading Laura Andersen's work.

So, this was a wonderful, riveting read that I can definitely recommend who love the old style mildly chilling romantic suspenses.",1520553600,4,year simpli enjoy pull older dusti book librari shelv might rememb older gothicflavor romant suspens mari stewart victoria holt daphn dumauri love write gave one littl chill harrow adventur heroin nice bit legend histori altogeth say share fact darkll bride set mountain counti wicklow ireland belong illustri group darkl bride start reader present day beginn scholar carragh ryan invit take threeweek temp job job dream chanc go real irish castl seat gallagh famili catalogu librari mayb mayb find lost manuscript intrigu victorian novelist one great carragh discov unsolv murder twenti year hint dark cur histori associ deeprath castl gallagh decis aidan gallagh put castl content hand nation trust stir past carragh aidan must discov secret past keep dark stir flashback two earlier time line help fill came answer discov one one author instil forebod atmospher eeri sen supernatur close even though never sure like famili gather never sure innoc guilti say whose secret pertin murder castl secret even carragh stranger

I enjoyed all of these novels but my fave is probably the one titled Loaded. A mall cop is hailed as a hero until the full story is revealed. It has plenty to say about gun control and with everything currently going on in our world, this story is timely.

Although I shy away from short fiction, I couldn't help but fall into these stories. Hill delivers realistic characters and has a knack for pacing. I never felt like the stories were too short which is how I sometimes feel with short fiction.

It was so atmospheric that you could feel the maleficence just radiating out of the gothic manor house The Bridge. Strange things were happening to the new pregnant bride who travels there after her husband's premature death. Her traveling companion is her husband's cousin Sarah.

I know the silent companion wooden figures will stay in my memory after some of the story fades in the future. I usually read in bed each night but with this book I stayed up longer to read in the brighter lights of the living room with the tv going in the background. It wasn't so much that the story scared me but it creeped me out.

The book goes back between two time periods at The Bridge. The time periods were 1635 and 1865. I thought what a good movie this would make but did wonder how they handle the alternating time periods due to costumes and expense.

28826,2850,3852,"I am still reeling from the emotional roller coaster created by KMM having just finished 'High Voltage'.  It has a gripping start and by 4% I was bawling. In fact, there were at least three places in the story where she had me in tears.  Having been somewhat baffled by the last book and the appearance of Jada, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I trusted Ms. Moning and her vision for this series.  High Voltage is a fabulous book, rich with detail, incredible characters, an epic love story, and some great messages about life.  The red threads analogy will stay with you.

People who were put off by the idea of Dani and Ryodan ultimately connecting romantically will likely never come back to this series and that is their prerogative.  It is, however, as if they have forgotten that one of the characters is many tens of thousands of years old, and that nothing inappropriate actually happened when she was a minor. I think Ms. Moning was brilliant to create the Dancer story line.  Not only was he an incredible character, he was the perfect partner for her age and experience.

""... I kissed him like he was the only man I deemed complex, brilliant, and strong enough to be worth kissing...""

This is a Dani centered book.  We get insights into her background and thoughts that make this unique character even more complex.  It is rare to find a fictional character this well-developed and in the process of becoming self-aware.  Dani refers to herself as a gray sheep.  ""I've learned in recent years to bleach my coat, the better to blend.  And when they aren't looking I'm as gray as I need to be.""  The parts about her restructuring her brain to deal with past trauma and issues she wants to avoid is brilliant.

I should include the fact that there are funny parts as well.  Now in her early 20's, Dani is suddenly aware of the sexual attraction of the Nine and Ryodan in particular.  ""Holy distorting diode, please tell me Ryodan doesn't throw off this charge off now, too.""  Dani having to deal with both jealousy and being honest, at least with herself, about her feelings for Ryodan is powerful.

 I imagine that some readers will be initially frustrated that Ryodan is out of the picture for the most of the first eight chapters of the book.  Moning does a great job of explaining why as the story progresses and their reunion is that much more charged.  While Ryodan is as powerful as ever, this is a man in love who is ready to begin a relationship with the woman he worships.  KMM shows us how much Ryodan has given up for Dani, how important she is to him, and how vulnerable she makes him.

The world building continues as the plot moves forward with the battle between Fae, the old gods, and mortals.  The Song of Making has had unintended consequences which impacts the story line dramatically.  Because this series is so rich with details, KMM does a great job of using Christian MacKeltar to fill in details the reader might have forgotten from earlier books.  Although I have read them all at least three times, I was pleased to have this woven into the story.

If you like to read reviews before buying the book, you might want to be careful with this one.  KMM has done such a fabulous job of creating many plots twists and other surprises that it would be a real shame to have these revealed ahead of time.  For the last quarter of the story I spent much of the time going 'Aha!' and it would be a shame to miss this experience. The planning needed to have brought all the novels to this point is astounding.  If you are not sure you should buy this, download a sample and then go with your gut rather than risk any spoilers.  Also, if you are new to Moning's literary world, do yourself a favor and start right at the beginning with Darkfever.",1520553600,5,still reel emot roller coaster creat kmm finish high voltag grip start 4 bawl fact least three place stori tear somewhat baffl last book appear jada wasnt sure expect trust m mone vision seri high voltag fabul book rich detail incred charact epic love stori great messag life red thread analog stay peopl put idea dani ryodan ultim connect romant like never come back seri prerog howev forgotten one charact mani ten thousand year old noth inappropri actual happen minor think m mone brilliant creat dancer stori line incred charact perfect partner age experi kiss like man deem complex brilliant strong enough worth kiss dani center book get insight background thought make uniqu charact even complex rare find fiction charact welldevelop process becom selfawar dani refer gray sheep ive learn recent year bleach coat better blend arent look im gray need part restructur brain deal past trauma issu
28827,2085,1281,"This is a very interesting memoir by a woman who is the daughter of extremists.  There is no doubt there is mental illness in her family--both of her parents and her brother seem to have some issues.  However, I can't help but wonder about the author herself.  By her own admission in the book she went through panic attacks and a long period when she did nothing but binge watch TV programs--depression???  She says her father is bipolar, but this is just her idea based on a freshman psych class, not an actual diagnosis.  I believe that the author wrote the book in good faith, and that she believes this book is the truth.  However, I suspect this is her perception of the truth.  There are a number of negative reviews from people claiming to be family members or friends of the family.  After having read the book, I suspect that the book is based on truth and is factual, but that perhaps the author's interpretation of the story is different from other people's experience.  Whatever the truth is, it is quite clear that this is a very twisted family.  I believe these parents did really love their children, but their beliefs caused them to become poor parents.  People should have the right to their own religious beliefs, but when your beliefs harm your children--such as not taking a badly burned child to the emergency room--your rights end.  Not sending children to school, and then not taking time to really do the homeschooling is wrong.  No college freshman should not know about the holocaust or never have heard of Martin Luther King, which happened to the author.  At the very least, these parents were dangerously radical.  They also did ridiculously unsafe things.  No normal family has this many truly horrific injuries.

When she sees more riders coming she shoots at them, too. Unfortunately, the man she hit was her intended

Ms. Jenkins always writes a good story and this one is no exception. Her words flow well and she creates conflict as well as love in her stories.

The doctor was expecting a lady from back east. She was hoping for a love match. No one lied in their letters but meeting each other changes expectations. He has no interest in love. She wears denims and can do much more than household duties. Even worse, she has her own money.

Her husbands mother-in-law hates her and has browbeat the young daughter. Another woman in town wanted him for herself and shes very critical of Regan. But Regan can hold her own.

One of my favorite lines was when the girl asks her new momma if she and daddy were going to jump around on the bed like her friends parents did. Sure, thats what they were doing

With lots of odd relatives and friends, the two grow closer together. Its great fun to watch how they respond to the challenges.

Whens hes the main suspect after his super popular classmate is hit by a car, what little dignity and solitude he had is shattered.

The gossip, speculation and rumors after the small town of Havenkill are rocked by the accident is unreal, the author likens it to a virus, a disease and thats such a great comparison as these vicious rumors infect the whole town and impact so many peoples lives.

This was my first book by Gaylin and Im really impressed, she weaves a compelling story and one that kept my attention the whole way through. This would be a great book club read as it tackles many relevant and current issues such as peer pressure, metal health issues and the negative effects of social media.

I find myself constantly astounded by the books Robin Benway writes. ALSO KNOWN AS was hilarious and adorable. EMMY & OLIVER was hilarious and adorable and beautiful. this one? Hilarious. Adorable. Beautiful. Amazing. Wonderful.
Im not going to say a ton about the rep, as I am a straight, white girl, but I felt it was extremely well written. There are several romances in this story, but it wasn't all romance. I feel like a lot of contemporaries focus so much on romance that we forget that there are other stories to tell. I was promised a hard-hitting tale of what it means to be family and thats what this book delivered, with fascinating characters and many, many tears.
As with most contemporaries, this was a character-driven novel and thats what really shone out to me. From chapter one, they grabbed me and pulled me in. This book made me cry for the first time before I was even 4% in,
I just cant even put into words how hard-hitting this book is.what I love about it is the feeling it gave me while I read, the characters I laughed and cried and grew with, and the victory of watching them grow.
Adoption is something so dear to me, because without it I wouldnt have the best little siblings ever. Its a way I someday want to give a home to a child who needs it. And this book doesnt just show the good side of Adoption, or even just the bad. It shows both and paints a beautiful picture of three different families, what it means to be a part of a family, and how it feels to watch one fracture. This is a book I can guarantee Ill be gifting my siblings someday, because it is so important.
But first, lets talk romance. While it isn't the focus of the story, it is a little side plot which I am a HUGE fan of. We have three main characters, so three main love interests. Mayas girlfriend Claire, Joaquins ex Birdie, and Grace has well she has Rafe, who is my favorite. He was respective and funny and adorable and tbh Im stealing him if thats allowed. All the romances were extremely different, but all very well-written and SO shippable.
Theres so much more I want to say, but I cant find the words to voice how strongly I love this book. You won't understand unless you read it. GO. READ.

28839,4898,2149,"This book. I cant even. I cant think of words to describe it. It was so action-packed and beautiful and sad and yalllllll. YALL.
Thrust book is a chosen one story, but its so well done you don't even realize it until the end, it has a KILLER slow burn romance.
I keep trying to think of things to say about this book, so you all truly understand how amazing it is, but Im lost for words.
I will say it took a few tries and about 20% for me to really get into this book. But heres the thing: once you get into it, you won't want to stop reading. This has a lot of my absolute favorite tropes. Chosen One(done well), forbidden romance, forced betrothal/marriage to a creepy guy(that makes me sound weird. Idk, I like seeing the heirones get out of that situation)
Also the romance is ridiculously good. Its slow burn, like super good slow burn. Like sit the romance in the back burner to simmer and come back tomorrow slow burn. So. Good. Ansnkxksnhxjksmsnsh. I loved it so freaking much, the relationship is absolute GOALS. G O A L S.
This book went kind of slow, but even the slower parts were very interesting, and then the last 40% is like BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM. Like you won't be able to put this book down. Prop open your eyelids, youll be reading nonstop until you finish the book.
This book has DRAGONS, yall. DRAGONS. and the way they're incorporated is so inventive, and a play on the whole dragon taming trope which I LOOOOOVE. There are a ton of tropes in this story, but somehow it takes a little bit to even recognize them as tropes. They seem very original and were obviously very well thought out and they were just so different!! So good!!
I loved all the mystery and the fantastical little bits, the old stories, and the different ways those came into the story, and how at the end everything connected, it was just so amazing.
I will admit I was confused a lot during the story, mostly at the world and some other things, because I often get confused with epic fantasy. The worlds are so big, and theres so much information, and they are long books, and Im super forgetful so I got kind of confused at several parts, but I did figure it out after a little bit, and the book does explain things really well.
Honestly, this book remind me of one of my all time favorite series, the Tales of Goldstone Wood. This book is an A++++++++ fantasy. its got all the essentials. Slow burn romance, DRAGONS, evil dudes, tropes reimagined in amazing ways, crazy good plot twists, and an absolutely enthralling story world.",1520553600,5,book cant even cant think word describ actionpack beauti sad yalllllll yall thrust book chosen one stori well done dont even realiz end killer slow burn romanc keep tri think thing say book truli understand amaz im lost word say took tri 20 realli get book here thing get wont want stop read lot absolut favorit trope chosen onedon well forbidden romanc forc betrothalmarriag creepi guythat make sound weird idk like see heiron get situat also romanc ridicul good slow burn like super good slow burn like sit romanc back burner simmer come back tomorrow slow burn good ansnkxksnhxjksmsnsh love freak much relationship absolut goal g l book went kind slow even slower part interest last 40 like bam bam bam bam bam bam bam like wont abl put book prop open eyelid youll read nonstop finish book book dragon yall dragon way theyr incorpor invent play whole dragon tame trope looooov ton trope stori somehow take littl bit even recogn trope seem origin

28841,422,3823,"I enjoyed this book.  After reading the earlier books in the series last year, I was really curious about this newest installment.  I knew going into this book that it was set in the same world as the previous books but it would feature different characters.  I was relieved to find that I liked this new group of characters right away.  I had a really nice time with this story.

Vicki is a rather new resident in the area.  She recently acquired a resort property, The Jumble, on Lake Silence as part of her divorce agreement.  The resort is just starting to conduct business with its first renter.  When a body is discovered near the resort, a chain of events begin that will put everything in jeopardy.

This book had a colorful cast of characters.  Vicki was easy to like.  She was such an honest and dependable person that hasn't always been treated well by others.  Grimshaw was the calm authoritative voice of reason that everyone needed.  He really seemed to care about Vicki and the residents in town.  Julian is a good friend to Vicki and Grimshaw and steps into help and give advice when it is needed.  I really liked how the wider group of characters quickly felt like a community working together.

There was a lot of action to keep everyone busy in this book.  Vicki's right to The Jumble ends up being called into question by a group that has their own agenda.  The property has a very detailed list of rules that must be followed since it is in the territory of the Others that Vicki has worked to follow while those who want to take the property plan to ignore.  I really liked seeing how scary some of the Others could be when agreements were not followed.  I was never quite sure how things would work out and was a bit nervous for the characters at times.

I would recommend this book to others.  I think that anyone new to the series would be okay jumping in with this book but the background information from the earlier books was very helpful.  I thought that this book came to a very satisfactory ending.  I am really not sure whether their will be future books with this group of characters or not since the story felt very complete but I would certainly welcome any future installments.

28842,3812,3823,"I've read every one of the ""Others"" books and enjoyed them immensely. The only thing that puzzles me is the behavior of the humans against the terra indigene. For people who apparently grew up in a world occupied by Others, you would think that they would  be more cautious in their dealings with them, knowing that they can very easily become meat. I wish I lived in a world with the Others! I would treat them with the respect they deserve and always carry around shinies for the Crowgard as well as carrots for the Sproingers. Once a month, I would leave an offering for the Elders and thank them for allowing us to live on their land and protecting us in a way.

28848,1421,3722,"Ive had mixed feelings about Curtis Sittenfeld.  Some of her work totally resonates with me;  some (such as Eligible or American Life) were misses. But one thing remains consistent: Curtis Sittenfeld is a natural-born storyteller and she makes me want to keep reading.

In You Think It, Ill Say It, the overriding theme is how our perceptions change with the gifts of time and distance. Over and over, were treated to characters who are brought face-to-face with their nemesis from an earlier and more vulnerable time.

In Bad Latch, for example, a new mom runs into the annoying fellow participant in her prenatal yoga class, who constantly spouted self-congratulatory and know-it-all statements. Life throws a wrench into things and when the narrator sees her again, shes far more real.  Or The Prairie Wife, when another harried mother comes across her childhood girl crush, who is now the darling of social media, and finds that both their lives have taken unexpected detours. Or A Regular Couple  a woman on her honeymoon runs into a school friend who inadvertently (or perhaps deliberately) humiliated her long ago.

Each of these characters have their chance at redemption  and even gratification  as they emerge more grounded after the fleeting and unexpected time spent with someone who has weighed on their mind. It is, I think, most peoples fantasy  to meet someone from the distant past in ones own more secure and mature iteration.

The best of the stories, in my opinion, are the most nuanced: The World Has Many Butterflies, for example, leverages the humiliation felt by a discontented wife who shares snarky observations about others in their affluent set with a man who is really just using her for amusement. And Volunteers Are Shining Stars is a fine portrait of a damaged girl/woman who is using her volunteer opportunity to reinforce her own biases. All in all, this is a highly readable collection that is marred only by the lack of risk taken by the author in some of the stories.",1520553600,4,ive mix feel curti sittenfeld work total reson elig american life miss one thing remain consist curti sittenfeld naturalborn storytel make want keep read think ill say overrid theme percept chang gift time distanc treat charact brought facetofac nemesi earlier vulner time bad latch exampl new mom run annoy fellow particip prenat yoga class constantli spout selfcongratulatori knowital statement life throw wrench thing narrat see she far real prairi wife anoth harri mother come across childhood girl crush darl social medium find live taken unexpect detour regular coupl woman honeymoon run school friend inadvert perhap deliber humili long ago charact chanc redempt even gratif emerg ground fleet unexpect time spent someon weigh mind think peopl fantasi meet someon distant past one secur matur iter best stori opinion nuanc world mani butterfli exampl leverag humili felt discont wife share snarki observ other affluent set man realli use amus volunt shine star fine portrait damag girlwoman

28851,980,3120,"Ahoy there me mateys!  This was an audiobook that I picked up for two reasons: 1) the author previously won the Newbery Medal and 2) it has a giant cat on the cover.

The cat was supposed to be both invisible and magic.  I had assumed that the story would be lighthearted and that the cat and little boy would get into all kinds of adventures.  This book had a way more serious tone.  It was about a struggling boy named Jackson.  His mom lost her job and his dad has MS.  They are poor and about to lose their home . . . again.  His parents continue to treat every situation with an upbeat attitude.  Jackson knows the problem is serious and doesn't know how to make his parents tell him the truth about their circumstances.

Like how Harvey the rabbit is a sign of alcoholism, Crenshaw is a sign of troubled times.  One of the more interesting points of this book is that Crenshaw doesn't magically fix things.  He is more of a sounding board and a solid presence in Jackson's life.  A friend.  Only, in the beginning, Jackson thinks he is going insane because why should he be seeing a giant talking cat that he thought was an imaginary friend he left back in kindergarten.

I enjoyed the fact that Jackson is going through self-discovery and that the cat doesn't magically fix the parents' situation.  The cat is a background personality for the most part and much of his involvement is through flashbacks.  I loved that Jackson had loving parents who did want the best for their children.  I loved silly Crenshaw.  This was a wonderful story, dealing with the effects of poverty, friendship, family, and resilience.  I will certainly be reading more of Katherine Applegate's work.

Having really loved this author's previous two books, I was very excited when I saw she had a new one out. I was even more excited when I managed to snaffle an early review copy. I cleared some space on my TBR and dove right in. All was going swimmingly and I was really enjoying it until about half way through when I paused and said to my brother that I thought I knew where it was going and that I really hoped I wasn't right. I put it aside and carried on regardless. Sadly I was right and even with the author's explanation which satisfied a few of the niggles I had about the outcome, it just wasn't enough for me to really believe in what I had been reading. In fact, I even called the red herring that the author also slipped it, I was actually hoping that this was going to be the real reveal! Looking at other reviews, I appear to be in the minority and I admit that maybe my early guess may have skewed my later feelings and things could have been very different for me had I not seen it coming. But that's how it was and I have to write my reviews with honesty or I am not being true to myself as a reader/reviewer.
It wasn't all bad though, as I said, I was really enjoying it up until I had my moment of clarity. the characters were working well for me, the story was interesting and kept my attention nicely. Actually, the story kept me interested throughout as, ignoring my feelings about the way the book was going, it was still interesting how we would eventually get there and what would happen when we did. Niggles aside, I though the actual ultimate ending was very well done.
It's hard to write much more about the book without being able to qualify my thoughts and feelings. I have tried to put a few things down but invariably they either don't make sense without further explanation, or hint too much about things that are best left unsaid. I will just end on a positive point though. Everything aside, it was a very readable book. I absolutely flew through it - both before and after my epiphany. So I guess I can't feel too hard done by. It also hasn't skewed my feelings about the author and wouldn't stop me reading any of her future books.

28855,4898,1945,"Time hop stories and I have always had a rocky relationship. I don't always notice the time jump so its just a mess. But this was the second one Ive read that I actually liked. Yay! Despite my aversion to them, I unconsciously like to sign myself up to read them. 
While it took a little while to get into this, I did really enjoy it. I totally didn't buy the romance between Holt and Tenley, so that held me back a little.
For me, this book, and the characters of Tenley and Birdie, were easy to relate to, as I myself am a writer. The main struggle of the first half of the story(Tenley trying to break through writers block/worried shell never write another good book) was easy to relate to since it was a struggle that every writer, including myself, has had those fears.
Let me just say; I absolutely loved Jonah and his family! Thats one of my favorite parts of reading Christian fictionthe strong, loving, welcoming family of a major character who eat good food, have traditions, and are generally the best. Jonah as a character was absolutely perfect, moral to a fault, and an amazing follower of Jesus.
This book was a delicious exploration of morals, disconnected family, and broken relationships. I loved every second and cried my way through a good chunk of it.

28858,1303,3642,"Thirteen-year old Leni Allbright is in a tough spot. Her parents, Ernt and Cora, are desperately in love...and incredibly unstable. Since her dad came home from Vietnam, his moods are erratic. He drinks a lot and can't hold a job. He's abusive to Leni's mom, but she always forgives him afterward, no matter how bad it gets. Because Ernt is a bit of a ""dreamer,"" the family moves around a lot, always chasing the next scheme that Ernt thinks will make them happy.

But things change when Ernt gets a letter saying he's inherited a piece of land and a house in Alaska, left to him by one of his soldier friends, now passed, from the war. He decides that a(nother) fresh start in the Alaskan wilderness is just what the family needs, and they all begin the long journey to the remote cabin. When they arrive, though, they realize they are not at all prepared for the brutal and unforgiving conditions of the wild. They learn to survive over time, in no small part to the generosity of their neighbors, but nothing prepares them for how the long winter nights affect Ernt's mental health. Things get dicey fast, and Leni and Cora soon realize that the greatest threat to their safety isn't the wild animals or brutal cold outside, but rather the volatile and abusive man living inside their home.

* * * * *

If you've read The Nightingale, you know that author Kristin Hannah loves to create sweeping sagas that show the growth of one main character as she faces obstacle after obstacle. Hannah always manages to balance the detailed inner lives of her characters with enough action to keep the story barreling along. Her books are never boring, and The Great Alone is no exception.

I loved seeing Leni grow up in these pages. As a character, she is so believable, relatable, and endearing. From the very beginning on through to the end, I felt for her, and I felt protective of her. More than that, though, I admired her strength and ability to endure. I developed so much respect for her, and she actually made me feel, I don't know...hopeful.

I also thought Hannah did an impressive job of showing the complicated inner workings of Ernt and Cora's abusive relationship. Hannah is honest about the dysfunction, but she also shows how the couple's intense love for each other keeps them together. It's hard to witness the toxicity of that relationship---especially when it hurts Leni over and over and over again---but it was believable and powerful, and I couldn't look away.

I do have a couple complaints---and, ironically, these are some of the same gripes I had with The Nightingale. First, the book went on too long. There were a couple ""full circle"" moments at the end that felt like unnecessary fluff. I didn't need or want the story to be so neatly wrapped up like that. Second, Hannah makes her characters go through A LOT of suffering---to the point that it becomes borderline ridiculous. (MINOR SPOILER ALERT) Matthew's storyline falls into this category for me.

Still. The Great Alone is an exceptional read. It's engaging from start to finish, with an unbeatable setting and a diverse cast of characters dealing with relevant and complex issues.

28862,1560,3848,"The million-copy bestselling author returns with a psychological novel of disappearance and revenge.

Twelve years ago Finn and his girlfriend Layla are returning from Megve and they make a further stop on their return journey after supper in Paris, for a comfort break in a little lay-by. As the car comes to a stop, Layla shares some disconcerting news with Finn and his red rage surges like a volcano. Layla goes missing and when Finn comes to his senses, he searches for the lost love of his life but to no avail. Perhaps she has been kidnapped, murdered, held captive. He doesnt believe that he could have harmed her whilst his anger enveloped him. The police certainly dig deep to discount his possible involvement. Finn gives his version of the story to the police, but it isn't the whole truth

As the story progresses, the chapters are a mix of Now 2018 and Before 2006 as the author drip feeds the story of Laylas disappearance, how the two became a pair and how life moved on in the aftermath of Laylas vanishing. Finn, in the present, is living with his new girlfriend, Ellen. Theirs is a pretty content life in fictional Simonsbridge in the Cotswolds, with cosy together time in between his bouts of working in Investments in the city.

He has kept the cottage in Devon, which he shared with Layla before she went missing, it is like an untended shrine to the memory of their life together.

One day, the tiniest figurine, the baby of a Russian Doll set appears. The significance is not lost on Finn  the Russian Doll had great significance in Laylas childhood with her sister. When more identical figures appear through the post and are randomly positioned where they will be found by Finn and by Ellen, life becomes decidedly unsettled. His angst is further compounded by the arrival of e mails, purporting to be from Layla.

The author includes plenty of switchbacks, red herrings, and she solidifies each new development before moving on to the next part of the story. You really cant get lost as the storyline moves forward  elements of the plot are reworked (yes, a little too much at times).

For me, the story teetered on the edge of being just plausible (OK, I need to suspend belief more often!). At times the plot was a little over-egged and none of the characters had sufficient depth to turn this into a really memorable psychological thriller  there is fury and rage that Finn needs to contain, which started way back, fomented by a girlfriend who cheated on him. Could there be sibling rivalry? Is domestic abuse rife? Perhaps Finns friend Harry is not all he seems, and as for Ruby the publican at their local pub and so it goes on. It is gripping and I certainly did want to know how the story turned out! #ForgetSleep

Location in terms of TripFiction and literary wanderlust is not really a significant player in the novel, although the sense of cosy pubs and English countryside are certainly a factor.",1520553600,4,millioncopi bestsel author return psycholog novel disappear reveng twelv year ago finn girlfriend layla return megv make stop return journey supper pari comfort break littl laybi car come stop layla share disconcert news finn red rage surg like volcano layla goe miss finn come sen search lost love life avail perhap kidnap murder held captiv doesnt believ could harm whilst anger envelop polic certainli dig deep discount possibl involv finn give version stori polic isnt whole truth stori progress chapter mix 2018 2006 author drip feed stori layla disappear two becam pair life move aftermath layla vanish finn present live new girlfriend ellen pretti content life fiction simonsbridg cotswold cosi togeth time bout work invest citi kept cottag devon share layla went miss like untend shrine memori life togeth one day tiniest figurin babi russian doll set appear signific lost finn russian doll great signific layla childhood sister ident figur appear post randomli posit found finn

28864,1282,106,"This is a book club review, with very little summary of the book itself. Our book club read this book as our February book club. Our book club rates books on readability, likability, quality, and of course, discussion merit. Eleanor Oliphant ended up being in our top favorite book club reads of all time, hence the five star rating.

Eleanor Oliphant is a dark comedy about a woman's  journey into finding her path, to opening up, and to facing her emotions/head/past. It's difficult to give a summary of this book that does not include spoilers, which I believe could take away from the beauty of this book. However, due to the dark nature of this book, there may be triggers here for some readers (please see very bottom note with spoiler triggers).

As a book club read, this book rated very high, an 8 of out 10, because of the amount of discussion that came from it. We were truly invested in this discussion - members shed tears, laughed, hugged... it was a wonderful book to discuss. We talked for hours and hours, and eventually ran out of time. We rarely have so much discussion with books that is so deep and meaningful. And everyone agreed that the book was likable despite the dark subject matter. The book is so incredibly funny and sweet, that it makes the hard topics just a bit easier. As far as quality, the book is far from flawless. Individual ratings were the book in general were about a 6, so a bit lower. But as far as a book club selection, the book was a great deal of fun and very worthy of a group discussion.

The book takes place in Scotland, which made for a fun and lively theme, and a Scottish potluck. This book, surprisingly, has a LOT of food mentions, so there was plenty of recipes to select from. Everyone enjoyed eating the foods that Eleanor and the other characters mention in the book.

Overall, this book is recommended for book clubs!

***SPOILER TRIGGER WARNINGS*** I so often get asked for triggers, I just share these for book club reviews now. After all, what may be fine for the individual reader is not always great in a book club/group discussion. But, of course, triggers are also spoilers, so please do not read on if you do not want that. I will also add the disclaimer that none of these triggers were an issue for our book club, and no one had any problems with the subject matter. We include these strictly as a warning for other book clubs. Topics included: Childhood abuse and trauma, murder, death, suicide topics, alcoholism, and mental health issues.",1520553600,5,book club review littl summari book book club read book februari book club book club rate book readabl likabl qualiti cours discus merit eleanor oliph end top favorit book club read time henc five star rate eleanor oliph dark comedi woman journey find path open face emotionsheadpast difficult give summari book includ spoiler believ could take away beauti book howev due dark natur book may trigger reader plea see bottom note spoiler trigger book club read book rate high 8 10 amount discus came truli invest discus member shed tear laugh hug wonder book discus talk hour hour eventu ran time rare much discus book deep meaning everyon agre book likabl despit dark subject matter book incred funni sweet make hard topic bit easier far qualiti book far flawless individu rate book gener 6 bit lower far book club select book great deal fun worthi group discus book take place scotland made fun live theme scottish potluck

Later:

It's been almost two weeks since I finished this audiobook and I still feel like I'm going through withdrawals. It is not at all the type of book I normally read, and to be honest I would have struggled through it a lot more if I were trying to read the physical book. But the audio was AMAZING. I felt like the narrator was telling me his actual life story, telling me about his real family and friends.

I mean, this book won a Pulitzer Prize, so obviously it's good. But seriously: it's good. I could listen to it for the rest of my life and be happy. I was surprised when it ended - see above re: I WANT MOOOORE.

Plum Tea Crazy, the nineteenth entry in the Tea Shop Mystery series, is full of Southern charm.  The delicious tea shop setting, complicated suspect list, and the right mix of cozy and danger make this installment worthy of the long running series.

While at a soire, local tea shop owner Theodosia and her friend and employee Drayton watch, horrified, as a guest falls to his death.  It soon becomes obvious that the fall is not the cause of death, and banker Carson Lanier is the victim of foul play. Since Theodosia is curious by nature, was present at the time of death, and has a bit of a reputation for investigating, she does not hesitate to look into things when Heritage Society president Timothy Neville seeks out her assistance.  With plenty of gossip pointing to a buffet of suspects, Theodosia weeds through it all to get to bottom of things, all while serving tea and attending high society events.

I have been a fan of the Tea Shop mysteries since the first book, Death by Darjeeling, was published.  It is hard to believe that Plum Tea Crazy is the nineteenth entry.  I find the setting and characters still fresh.  At this point, reading the series is like visiting old friends.  I am easily immersed in Laura Childs attention to detail and obvious love of all things tea related.  I can smell the scones baking and the rejuvenating aroma of freshly brewed tea, and feel the Charleston humidity.  I do wish there was a real life Indigo Tea Shop to patronize.

In Plum Tea Crazy, Theodosia finds herself mixed up with antique weapons, a society fashion show, and shady bank deals all in the name of investigating.  The mystery surrounding Carson Laniers death is sufficiently complex with several viable suspects. However, the killer became obvious to me a third to midway through the book.  Still, it is enjoyable to follow along side Theodosia. She is a competent woman and businessman and usually level headed. I felt like she is untypically quick to set her sights on a suspect then bounce back and forth between suspects, always sure of their guilt. There seems to be a plethora of combative, unpleasant characters this time around, and I have no patience for this level of rudeness.  Even Theodosia is uncharacteristically rude here. She seems to have lost some of her graciousness and Southern manners. Perhaps it is a sign of the world we live in. Of course, Drayton, who is my favorite character, is ever genteel, and I love him for it. Theodosia has a new-ish boyfriend, Detective Pete Riley, and he is featured much more than Detective Tidwell. I like that Pete does not try to keep Theo from investigating, but their relationship does not feel natural to me.  I guess time will tell how it will all play out.

Some cozy readers may find Childs description of Carsons literal downfall a little too detailed.  Also, the climactic reveal is more violent for Theodosia than in other books. By standard mystery parameters, though, these instances are still rather tame.

I greatly enjoyed Plum Tea Crazy and now feel the need to have a tea party utilizing Childs recipes and tips included at the back of the book.  I recommend Plum Tea Crazy to longtime fans of the series as well as any cozy reader, especially those who enjoy tea.",1520553600,4,brought ob review daniel plum tea crazi nineteenth entri tea shop mysteri seri full southern charm delici tea shop set complic suspect list right mix cozi danger make instal worthi long run seri soir local tea shop owner theodosia friend employe drayton watch horrifi guest fall death soon becom obviou fall caus death banker carson lanier victim foul play sinc theodosia curiou natur present time death bit reput investig hesit look thing heritag societi presid timothi nevil seek assist plenti gossip point buffet suspect theodosia weed get bottom thing serv tea attend high societi event fan tea shop mysteri sinc first book death darjeel publish hard believ plum tea crazi nineteenth entri find set charact still fresh point read seri like visit old friend easili immers laura child attent detail obviou love thing tea relat smell scone bake rejuven aroma freshli brew tea feel charleston humid wish real life indigo tea shop patron plum tea crazi theodosia find mix antiqu weapon societi fashion show shadi bank deal name investig mysteri surround carson lanier death

ever heard of second book blues? Hahahaha this book had none of that. It grabbed THREE DARK CROWNS by the throats and smashed it up and TOOK THAT FREAKING CROWN. I probably need several more days to properly process what the freak just happened but I THINK I LOVE THIS BOOK MORE THAN THREE DARK CROWNS IDK IDK.

The single hardest thing to get around was the heroine's husband and the dismissive and abusive way he treated her--and how she thought she was obligated to stay with him in spite of his hideous boorishness.

28882,4589,2053,"-A very touching short novel that could make anyone emotional. Its mostly told in flashbacks by a young girl who is just barely holding on to her life by a thread. It presents these flashbacks in a very unusual way and presents the relationships within what is evidently the very loving family that she came from.
-Last names are ignored here, as their last names could just all be family. Mia is the young girl that is the focus of the story and her father was a former member of a punk band and her mother followed suit. Once Mia was born, her father transformed and went back to school to become a bow tie wearing school teacher. Her mother changed outwardly as well, but inside, they were still the same fun loving and easy going people they always were. Mia had a younger brother, Teddy, born 10 years after her, with whom she had a very close, but occasionally teasing relationship. Mia had a natural musical talent from her father, but rather than go for pop music, she gravitated to classical music and playing a cello.
-In Oregon, where they lived, there was a light amount of snow that had fallen, but that was enough to cause a closure of the schools. The family decides to turn this into a fun outing and they all go for a drive. One moment, Mias thoughts are in mundane issues in her life and the next, all is turmoil. She is standing outside of the car which is now in pieces, after being broadsided by a pickup truck. Her father and mother are both dead and she starts searching for her brother, only to find a body that shouldnt be there. Its hers. Its here that the thoughts of the spirit of Mia takes over as she follows the medics who rush her body for emergency surgery.
-Once there, different parts of her life are recalled, from the boyfriend that appears to be a soulmate, though their relationship has its ups and downs; to her parents, who gave her such love and in their own way were very wise as they guided her through life; to her best friend, Kim, with whom she began their relationship as harsh enemies; and to her fathers parents, who are so different from each other but are each so close to her in their own way.
-Those people as well, come visiting in the hospital, and the spirit that is Mia, thinks about what they all mean to her, but she also thinks of all that shes lost and she thinks to herself that to go on living will be really hard. It would be so much easier to accept death and be with her parents and brother. It wouldnt be a successful story if she didn't choose life, but how she gets there is very well done. Its difficult not to feel for her as the people around her pray for her to get better, and understand that, even in life, things will be difficult for her going forward.

I love to read and am always on the lookout for new books to read. I had seen this one awhile ago but decided not to read it at the time because I have so many books I want to read. My twins' school is reading this collectively and I wanted to read it along with them so I decided to purchase my own copy so I would know what they were talking about and could help explain the book. I ended up reading ahead and just finished it. It was so good and I wish I had read it sooner, it was that good!

August Pullman is truly an ordinary kid in every way you would think of a ten-year-old boy, except for one thing. He was born with a deformed face and, despite many surgeries, he doesn't quite look ""normal."" His mom has homeschooled him so that he doesn't have to be out in the world. Now it's time for Auggie to enter fifth grade and his mom is really pushing for him to go to public school. Middle school is hard enough for any kid and Auggie and all of the students, faculty, and staff at Beecher Prep will learn about the power of kindness and how it can really affect us.

I started reading this book at the same time that I'm also reading it out loud to my five-year-old twins and I couldn't resist reading ahead! The story is engaging, descriptive, emotional at times, and truly heartwarming. I teared up at several parts, both happy and sad. Wonder is told from several characters' viewpoints so it's great to get a broader view of what's going on during the story than just from one character.

I would give this book ten stars if I could! I really felt like I was right there with the rest of the kids at Beecher Prep since the writing was so good and engaging.

28889,4589,2054,"-A very touching short novel that could make anyone emotional. Its mostly told in flashbacks by a young girl who is just barely holding on to her life by a thread. It presents these flashbacks in a very unusual way and presents the relationships within what is evidently the very loving family that she came from.
-Last names are ignored here, as their last names could just all be family. Mia is the young girl that is the focus of the story and her father was a former member of a punk band and her mother followed suit. Once Mia was born, her father transformed and went back to school to become a bow tie wearing school teacher. Her mother changed outwardly as well, but inside, they were still the same fun loving and easy going people they always were. Mia had a younger brother, Teddy, born 10 years after her, with whom she had a very close, but occasionally teasing relationship. Mia had a natural musical talent from her father, but rather than go for pop music, she gravitated to classical music and playing a cello.
-In Oregon, where they lived, there was a light amount of snow that had fallen, but that was enough to cause a closure of the schools. The family decides to turn this into a fun outing and they all go for a drive. One moment, Mias thoughts are in mundane issues in her life and the next, all is turmoil. She is standing outside of the car which is now in pieces, after being broadsided by a pickup truck. Her father and mother are both dead and she starts searching for her brother, only to find a body that shouldnt be there. Its hers. Its here that the thoughts of the spirit of Mia takes over as she follows the medics who rush her body for emergency surgery.
-Once there, different parts of her life are recalled, from the boyfriend that appears to be a soulmate, though their relationship has its ups and downs; to her parents, who gave her such love and in their own way were very wise as they guided her through life; to her best friend, Kim, with whom she began their relationship as harsh enemies; and to her fathers parents, who are so different from each other but are each so close to her in their own way.
-Those people as well, come visiting in the hospital, and the spirit that is Mia, thinks about what they all mean to her, but she also thinks of all that shes lost and she thinks to herself that to go on living will be really hard. It would be so much easier to accept death and be with her parents and brother. It wouldnt be a successful story if she didn't choose life, but how she gets there is very well done. Its difficult not to feel for her as the people around her pray for her to get better, and understand that, even in life, things will be difficult for her going forward.
-Very well written.",1520553600,4,touch short novel could make anyon emot mostli told flashback young girl bare hold life thread present flashback unusu way present relationship within evid love famili came last name ignor last name could famili mia young girl focu stori father former member punk band mother follow suit mia born father transform went back school becom bow tie wear school teacher mother chang outwardli well insid still fun love easi go peopl alway mia younger brother teddi born 10 year close occasion tea relationship mia natur music talent father rather go pop music gravit classic music play cello oregon live light amount snow fallen enough caus closur school famili decid turn fun outing go drive one moment mia thought mundan issu life next turmoil stand outsid car piec broadsid pickup truck father mother dead start search brother find bodi shouldnt thought spirit
28890,634,428,"Elio is the teenaged son of a scholar who lives in Italy by the sea, a quiet, sensitive, and musical boy who spends his days swimming, playing tennis, and reading. Staying with his family for the summer is Oliver, a young academic revising a manuscript for publication, and the focus of Elios inchoate amorous feelings. This novel recounts Elios hesitant, tentative, almost reflexively passive attempts to signal his deeper interest in Oliver while closely observing Olivers reactions and attempting to read Olivers feelings toward him. This pas de deux of ambiguous signals and misunderstandings and then mutual affection grows into a powerful love story when Elio realizes how fully he identifies with Oliver after spending more time with him and accepting Olivers invitation to call me by your name.

The setting for this novel is perfect - a villa by the sea with balconies and many neighbors and guests drawn from Elios fathers academic milieu passing through. High culture references to music, art, and literature abound, constituting an appropriate scene for the minutely described feelings of desire and the microscopic analysis of social gestures observed and interpreted by an adolescent newly conscious and highly perceptive of them. Nearby is a town with dancing, cafes, and a bookshop and the pair spend a memorable few days in Rome at the conclusion of the summer.

The final section of the novel provides a coda far into the future, giving the protagonist an opportunity to reflect with maturity on the summer and the profound meaning these experiences have had for him. The psychologically self-conscious style of the book and the nostalgic tone manage to create an impression in the reader that is both euphorically happy and devastatingly sad. The insights Elio gains into human connection and self-knowledge are so transcendent and profound and communicated so beautifully from his heart of hearts that this story is unforgettable.",1520553600,5,elio teenag son scholar live itali sea quiet sensit music boy spend day swim play tenni read stay famili summer oliv young academ revis manuscript public focu elio inchoat amor feel novel recount elio hesit tent almost reflex passiv attempt signal deeper interest oliv close observ oliv reaction attempt read oliv feel toward pa de deux ambigu signal misunderstand mutual affect grow power love stori elio realiz fulli identifi oliv spend time accept oliv invit call name set novel perfect villa sea balconi mani neighbor guest drawn elio father academ milieu pas high cultur refer music art literatur abound constitut appropri scene minut describ feel desir microscop analysi social gestur observ interpret adolesc newli consciou highli percept nearbi town danc cafe bookshop pair spend memor day rome conclus summer final section novel provid coda far futur give protagonist opportun reflect matur summer profound mean experi psycholog selfconsci style book nostalg tone manag creat impress reader euphor happi devastatingli sad insight elio gain human connect selfknowledg transcend profound commun

""Fried rice isn't worth dying for.""

Indeed. Casey Cox is an innocent fugitive, and she is on the run again. Disguising her appearance multiple times, Casey has managed to keep one step ahead of those who know that the truth will never set them free.

Dylan Roberts, an investigator hired initially to apprehend Casey, has become her solitary confidante and friend; his life hanging precariously in the balance aside hers, while he tries to dodge corruption in the Shreveport, Louisiana police department and gather enough evidence to bring justice to all.

Fans of Blackstock's first two books featuring Casey Cox and Dylan Roberts will be pleased to know that the conclusion to the now infamous ""If I Run"" series is just as climatic as it should be; terrifying, satisfying and gratifying.

28896,1282,493,"This is a book club review with no spoilers, and very little book summary.

Our book club read this book as our January selection. The themes that attracted us to the book was the idea of finding ones self, finding new passions, and having the courage to step away from what's comfortable to what makes you happy. It was a perfect ""New Year's"" book, when you're considering resolutions, hobbies, fresh starts... and in that way this book was very much a hit. The protagonist/heroine Lois is a woman you can relate to. She's stuck in a job that's technically meaningful and successful, but she's unfulfilled. She takes no joy in her day to day life, becoming a robot who goes through the motions... much like the robots she programs in her job. Lois, through a fun and sweet side story, inherits a secret sourdough starter... which eventually leads her in the direction of a new adventure.

Our book club rates books on readability, likability, quality, and of course, discussion merit. This book rated very high as readable and likable, but not as high on quality and discussion. As a book club selection, the discussion wasn't as intense or long as other selections we've read. There were topics to discuss such as those already mentioned above (finding ones self, etc.) and also some additional fun stuff... technology, old world traditions, the ancient art of cooking, wanderlust, secret passions, female perspectives as it pertains to the workplace, nutrition, and more. But somehow we just kept running short of conversation. The book is short in length, a quick read, and it could have been more developed perhaps? The quality of the writing was excellent (Robin Sloan is a very, very talented man!), but we felt it could have been just a little meatier.

Overall this book averaged to about a 6.5 on the rating of a ten scale. Which puts it in the higher average of books we've read, being just slightly above average on rating. So it was very good, and everyone was glad they had read it, but not ""great."" A disclaimer here is that every member felt this book was a wonderful read, but just not a great book club read? As in, it's the perfect Sunday, cozy, rainy read or beach read, just to enjoy as an individual.

One benefit of this book as a book club selection is the theme of the Sourdough itself. We turned that into a potluck theme, which was a huge success. We had homemade sourdough and bread from local bakeries... and the toppings to match (sliced cheeses, spreadable cheeses, fig jam, hummus, chicken salad, etc.). We also had a member volunteer to make starter for the group.

As a book club selection there are no triggers in this book to mention here - this was a clean, wholesome read with no controversy or contentious subject matter that we noticed. This could either be a good thing for your book club, if you like uplifting, quarky, light reads. But if you like something a bit darker, meatier, heavier, with more depth perhaps... this may not be the read for your book club.

I should mention that we read Sloan's other novel, Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Boookstore, in late 2014. Though that one also rated high as far as readability and likability, it got similar feedback from our group on the limited discussion topics, as well as perhaps being too quick and light. That book, however, did have a slightly darker subject matter that was appealing to the book club.

Overall I both recommend, and don't recommend, this book for a club. I hope this review gives insight to your book club and whether or not it's a match. I think some book clubs would really love this book, and find it inspirational and sweet, whereas some book clubs might find it too light and quick.

When a strange call comes in from one of the Wildlings, wolves so broken they can no longer function even in a strong pack like Bran's, Anna and Charles uncover a sinister plot to kill or capture the Wildlings. It then becomes a race against time to save the Wildlings and uncover the traitor who has been selling the pack's secrets to persons unknown.

This has all the characters we know and love/ hate. Charles and Anna, Leah, Asil, Tag, even Bran. We also meet a small group of badly damaged wolves, men who are in constant battle with their wolves, where one of the pair is insane, or worse. Many of the Wildlings are very old and hold deep dark secrets which 'someone' will stop at nothing to uncover.

I liked this, it had all the brilliant characters and great writing that I have come to expect from Patricia Briggs, and yet I didn't love it.

28908,1000,1603,"I've read a fair share of Nora Roberts books.  There is always romance and the spark of passion. Sometimes there is a touch of the historical or a flash of something magical.  However, Come Sundown veered from that happy beach read place where I hope to be transported each time I pick up one of her stories.  Come Sundown traded that overlay of fantasy with one of violence and degradation.  In this novel, one of the young protagonists is kidnapped on her way home and held captive for decades by a deranged and very brutal religious nut.  The reader is exposed to scenes of abject mental and physical cruelty that I found profoundly disturbing.  Truth be told, if I hadn't committed to reviewing this novel, I would never have continued reading it.  I am not sure why Nora Roberts chose to take this path and use misogyny and violence to further the plot of her romance.  I can only  hope that this is not a new direction she plans to continue pursuing.  When I open one of her many, many, many books, I look forward to a relaxing and happy read not one that makes me recoil and wish I had never ventured into her story to begin with.

Some things are glossed over a bit more than I would have liked, but the story makes up for most of that in the end.  The illustrated poems are a nice addition to the format.  Alexander has made a name writing stories in verse, and returning, in a way, to The Crossover was dual nostalgia.

The only surprising omissions to me were no brief stories about Johnnys working or personal relationships with Ed or Doc.

28919,1658,382,"I used to never be a reader who gave into the hype and buzz a new book can sometimes bring along with it. But while Instagram has taken book marketing to an entirely different level, some books are becoming difficult to ignore. Literally thousands upon thousands of readers, reviewers, publicists, and enthusiasts are pushing the free marketing of books attached to hashtags and accompanied by beautiful and creative photography upon Instagram and other social media site purveyors daily. The Cruel Prince was one book that began to saturate my feed as readers latched on to the newest novel by fantasy maven Holly Black; their accolades and insistent cries that the book shattered them caught my interest and I decided to dive in.

The opening is brutal. Young Jude and her two sisters are enjoying a quiet afternoon at home, the TV lulling them into a comfortable slumber while their parents tinker about in other parts of their cozy home. Unbeknownst to them, this is the day that everything they have ever known will change, as the man watching their home from across the street decides to finally make his move. The stranger barges into their haven and shatters the idyllic scene by murdering both of Jude's parents in a quick and succinct fashion.

Whisked away to the land of Faerie, Jude and her sisters are forced into a life settled firmly on the borders of being outsiders. Her oldest sister, Vivi, being the cause of the disruption in their lives, is ironically the most unhappy with their new situation. She is only Jude's half-sister, the result of their mother faking her own death and spiriting herself and her pregnant belly back to the mortal world, with the help of a secret love. Previously attached to a brutal war general of Faerie, Jude's mother committed the ultimate act of betrayal by hiding the child, and the result was her execution. By the laws vested in Faerie, General Madoc became responsible for the children of his wife the moment she died at his hand, and he takes his responsibilities very seriously.

Growing up in Faerie has had its difficulties, almost from day one. Jude is not one of them, not a member of the Fair Folk. She is human: dispensable and fragile; a veritable non-starter. Her saving grace, however, is that she is a member of the upper class and elite. Having been raised by Madoc garners her a touch of reverance. He is a man who commands respect and if he doesn't find it, he takes it by force. Having risen to become the right hand of the Faerie King by hook, crook, and buckets of blood, Jude is afforded a modicum of respect in Madoc's stead. But behind the scenes, she is taunted and ridiculed by her peers, looked at as a pretender, and as a frail human who has no real worth or talent. To say the situation is complicated is an understatement.

The worst of those who bully her is Cardan, the beautiful young Prince of Faerie who chooses to amuse himself by taunting her and putting her right onto the cusp of deathly danger before ripping her back. He skulks around the periphery of her life with his band of merry friends, waiting for any opportunity he can find to make her life miserable. Her twin sister Taryn also suffers the same fate of having her life soaked in nasty words and actions . . . but there is something different in the way Cardan treats Jude - almost as if he divines immense pleasure from making her bleed from within, from personally making her feel like less than human . . . and more like an animal.

Cardan is cruel, to say the least of it. But Jude has other things on her mind. She has to find a way to solidify her place in Faerie as the impending years of her adulthood begin to creep just over the horizon. She has some ideas on how to do this, but she finds that she's blocked at every turn by her pseudo-father, Madoc. He insists that he has her best interests at heart, and he has always treated her just the same as his true born daughter Vivi, but Jude is cloaked in a blanket of frustration and raw anger. She wants to fight. She's trained for it. So why won't he allow her her chance?

She's also finding herself strangely attracted to a member of Cardan's vicious pack, but the man in question seems to have secrets of his own, hidden within the endless depths of his mysterious soul and locked behind the doors of the expansive empty mansion on the outskirts of the forest that he calls home.

And then a proposition is brought to Jude, from the most unlikely of characters. The man most believed to become King after the current reign is over comes to her in secret, seeking an alliance. Prince Dain offers Jude her innermost heart's desires, in exchange for information. He wants her to become his spy, part of his Court of Shadows. And Jude must toe the thin line between safety and sure death to get the Prince what he demands.

But before Jude can achieve her goal and find her place in Faerie, everything begins to unravel like so much thread from a well-worn sweater. And on an evening that was supposed to be dedicated to a fresh new start, Jude will watch everything burn to the ground, leaving her to pick up the pieces and put them back together all on her own.

The Cruel Prince is the first book in the Folk of the Air trilogy, and before I recommend this to you let me say - you will be clamoring for more from the moment you turn the last page. This novel, set in the high-fantasy world of enigmatic Faerie, is sharp and deceptive, taking the reader on a roller coaster ride full of darkness and delight. The writing is masterful and faithful to the fictional world of Faerie as most high-fantasy readers know it. Sometimes YA books can come across as a bit corny, but this one was full of strong female characters and flawed systems. Nothing was obvious, and the plot was well-played.

This is one book that lives up to the hype. Appropriate for readers ages 13+, fans of The Cruel Prince would be wise to look into the rest of Black's literary catalogue, as the worlds of her novels have finely tuned connections. Also, the cover art and a sneak peek excerpt has been dropped via Entertainment Weekly - both can be viewed on their website.

28920,634,241,"I have read this book twice, most recently the updated edition from 2015, and what I cherished about it the first time I read it, what made it so memorable and useful, still holds up very much indeed over a decade later. Malkiel was an Economics professor at Princeton and his attitude toward investment methodology is scathingly anti-establishment.

He tears down one fad after another and one so-called expert after another. He cites countless academic studies in a not-at-all stuffy way to show that the experts don't know what they're doing and ought not to be listened to at all. He spends a lot of time talking about bubbles and different methods of analysing stocks only to show that pretty much every method or system that has ever been proposed for beating the market has not done so in any way, at least over a long period of time. A lot of it is just incredibly entertaining-I particularly enjoyed the bit about the University of California study which revealed that Wall Street analysts buy recommendations were found to underperform the market while their sell recommendations outperformed the market, meaning that if you want to make money I guess you should sell what the purported experts are telling you to buy and buy what they tell you to sell.

Anyways Malkiels point in presenting all this human folly is that you really cant expect to put together a portfolio of investments that will outperform the market consistently over a long period of time so you shouldnt even try. Just buy and hold low-cost, tax-efficient, broad-based index funds. Also, avoid fees, avoid experts, re-balance your portfolio from time to time, and dollar-cost average if you can. His advice rests on a foundation of decades of academic research which shows two important trends: 1. the market goes up, usually on average about 10 percent a year since 1926 and 2. investment authorities are pretty much always wrong, whether they are recommending tulip bulbs or suggesting investments based on which team won the Super Bowl (yes, thats a thing).

While thats the thesis of this book, its well worth reading for its exploration of investment theory and culture and the humour and style with which Malkiel doles out his wisdom. The book is peppered with amusing anecdotes and jokes along with a few cartoons. Its very compelling the way he questions and undermines other investment philosophies before laying out the case for indexing which is rooted in the randomness of the performance of individual stocks. The message her is that you don't need to heed expert advice because the academic research shows it to be worthless.",1520553600,5,read book twice recent updat edit 2015 cherish first time read made memor use still hold much inde decad later malkiel econom professor princeton attitud toward invest methodolog scathingli antiestablish tear one fad anoth one socal expert anoth cite countless academ studi notatal stuffi way show expert dont know theyr ought listen spend lot time talk bubbl differ method analys stock show pretti much everi method system ever propos beat market done way least long period time lot incred entertainingi particularli enjoy bit univers california studi reveal wall street analyst buy recommend found underperform market sell recommend outperform market mean want make money guess sell purport expert tell buy buy tell sell anyway malkiel point present human folli realli cant expect put togeth portfolio invest outperform market consist long period time shouldnt even tri buy hold lowcost taxeffici broadbas index fund also avoid fee avoid expert rebal portfolio time time dollarcost averag advic rest foundat decad academ research show two import trend

28930,4026,228,"The Snowman, Number 7 in the Harry Hole books by Norwegian author Jo Nesbo, is a fast-paced mystery that jolts the reader back and forth between theories and suspects.  This time, Harry is a shadow of his former self, thin and weary from some hard living and battles with personal demons.  He uses the skills he has learned from the US FBI to spot a pattern in some disappearances that seem to indicate that Norway might be entertaining a rare serial killer.  He uses his reputation in his department to get assigned a small team to help him follow up on missing women dating back from 2004 to 1992.  The one detail common to all the scenes: a snowman at the location of their last known whereabouts. His new team includes a sharp new detective, Katrine Bratt, who contributes some perceptive insight into the cases.  Harry manages to follow the clues to a variety of suspects.  Is there a connection to a doctor specializing in rare genetic disorders? Does it involve a missing officer who may have been working on his own? Or could it be related to a famous pundit seeking to cover up deviant practices?  Or is The Snowman someone else circling around the team, able to stay one step ahead and keep them chasing their tails?  There is a lot going on in this story, and it might be difficult for some to follow all the Norwegian names and places.  The use of the snowman as a sinister current throughout was a little far-fetched, but certainly original.  This book is a good example of how a strong main character can elevate a weaker installment in a series.  Hole is such a wonderfully depicted and flawed person that fans of Nesbo can easily forgive some plot lapses and implausible coincidences.

It wasn't the author.  It was me. I just couldn't wrap my head around Macbeth re-imagined as the head of a SWAT team who murders the Chief Commissioner of the police department. I know that Jo Nesbo took a huge leap of imagination and that his aim was to use the play for inspiration while being true to his fan base. But all the double dealing, spying, gun battles, treachery, murders and more just didn't make it for me.

Macbeth  as penned by Willy  had at its core the story of a couple whose ambition leads to the unmooring of their minds and their eventual downfalla true tragedy.  Macbeth as written by Jo Nesbo is more of a clever action thriller.

28935,662,3419,"This memoir is the absorbing story of a daughter coming face to face with her parents as people. We begin with her childhood and her unflattering assessment of the parenting she received. She ended up afraid of her father and disdainful of her mother, and spent her teen years as the kind of kid who is a challenge to parent. She is largely unmoved at her parents'  deaths, first her father and then her mother after years of alcoholism.  While cleaning up she finds letters her parents exchanged when they were young and in love, and they challenge her view of them and their relationship.  Her quest to understand them as people is fascinating, and it comes with a mystery, too:  was her father murdered or did he die in an accident?  The role of her father's first-generation Ukrainian heritage is especially interesting, as is the story of her mother, several generations further removed from her Polish roots, but still born into an ethnic environment that will shape her life.  The only disappointment I had with this memoir was perhaps inevitable, as the author decided not to have children of her own. She is sorry for her behavior as an often out of control teen, but she remains blameless and apart from her parents' parenting sins, as she has never committed any herself.  This is a minor quibble, though.

The story opens in June of 1950 on Edith and Joseph's wedding day, as they enter their beautiful home. De los Santos reveals the home in loving detail, and you can close your eyes and picture each room as Edith describes it, and even smell ""the sawdust and lemon oil and reckless salt wind.""

The home is in a beach town in Delaware, a busy place in the summer, but dreary and desolate in the winter. They have a happy life together, canoeing, photographing wildlife, and enjoying each other's company.

Flash forward to the current day, Clare Hobbes' wedding day. Clare is marrying Zach, a man who appears to be her perfect match. But something is not quite right, and after Clare encounters an elderly Edith on a bench at the wedding venue, she realizes she cannot marry Zach, which at first confuses, then enrages, him.

A few weeks later, Clare gets a letter from a lawyer- Edith has passed away and left her large home to Clare. Why did this happen? Clare only spoke to Edith briefly. Since she at odds, and getting away from her life might be good for her, Clare goes to the house, called Blue Sky House.

Clare learns that Edith used to run a bed and breakfast at Blue Sky, but abruptly left in 1956 after a murder occured in the town. Did Edith have anything to do with the murder? When Clare finds two sets of ledgers hidden in a cupboard, she enlists her childhood best friend Dev to help her investigate.

At first glance, I'll Be Your Blue Sky seems like a typical chick-lit book, two women in different times telling their stories, but it is so much more. De los Santos surprised me with Edith's story, and I found it engrossing and couldn't turn the pages fast enough.

I loved Edith's strength and courage, and her relationship with the town's sheriff was touching. I admit to be a little lost with Clare's family story, there seemed to be so many people to keep track of that I was confused. When I discovered that they were all introduced in de los Santos' previous two books, You Belong to Me and Love Walked In, I immediately went to my Goodreads page to put them on my Want to Read list.

I hope that de los Santos gives us another book with more of Edith's backstory, she is truly one of the more fascinating characters that I have encountered in awhile. If you like novels like Christina Baker Kline's The Orphan Train, give I'll Be Your Blue Sky a try.

28949,3896,3648,"Jennifer Egan's 2017 novel, Manhattan Beach, was set during WWII, and a big part of the story took place at a war factory, filled with women contributing to the war effort. The novel garnered great acclaim, deservedly so.

Janet Beard's The Atomic City Girls will appeal to fans of Manhattan Beach as it tells the fictional account of men and women who worked at a real munitions factory in Oak Ridge, Tennesee.  An entire city was created out of farmlands, and hundreds of people were brought there to work on a top-secret project- creating an atomic bomb.

Very few workers knew what they were working on; only scientists like Dr. Sam Cantor, a physicist from California, knew the true extent of what was going on. Sam found himself attracted to a young farm girl, June, whose grandfather had his land taken by the government for this project. June and Sam dated, even though Sam was a good ten years older than June, and much more sophisticated in the way of the world. He was also an alcoholic, and had a temper.

June's roommate Cici was a farm girl too, but she passed herself off as a society girl, from a good family, there just trying to help the war effort. What she really wanted was a rich husband from a prominent family, and she would do anything or hurt anyone to accomplish that goal.

The most compelling character for me was Joe Brewer. Joe was a black sharecropper who left his loving wife and three children behind in Alabama to go to Tennesee to make enough money for his family. Through Joe, his young protegee Ralph, and the young activist Ralph falls in love with, we see a different side to this great society.

The white workers have decent housing, and good food. June is impressed with the food, it's better than she had at home. The black workers lived in cold, damp huts, and they ate rice and beans for most meals.

Buses would pick up the workers and bring them to the work compounds, but the black riders were frequently tossed off the buses to make room for white workers. White married families were able to live together in houses, black families were separated, men in one hut, women in the other. The black workers on construction crews built the homes, but they were not allowed to live in them.

The Atomic City Girls (the title may be a misnomer, we get the male point of view here as well) is strongest when it shows the reader how the war effort worked in Oak Ridge. Workers were constantly reminded not to talk about their work with anyone, and not to write to their families about it. Letters home were read by government officials, and people were encouraged to turn in anyone who violated these policies.

I liked learning about this project, and the photos from the Department of Energy that are  interspersed throughout the book are fascinating. I was less interested in the love lives of the characters.

People who enjoyed Hidden Figures will also find The Atomic City Girls interesting.

Oh my. If you read this book you are definitely in for a treat. It's dark and twisted and romantic and complicated and just so, so good. I loved nearly everything about it, from the dynamic of the sisters, to the gifts and familiars and poison.
This book is just so well written and the character are 3D and every word just leaps off the page.
Also---this has multiple POVs in it, alternating between the three sisters. Unlike a lot of books, this was confusing, but actually enhanced the reading experience.
The romance in this story just kept throwing curveballs and I loved that. Honestly the book kept throwing curveballs. Every time things started going well, or just when they calmed down, SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEN NOTHING IS OKAY.
so what I'm trying to say is this book destroyed me so go read it.
But seriously. It's like so good. And if you still aren't sure, EpicReads has a trailer that is amazing so yesssss
Also you should read this so I can gloat over your pain when you finish it BECAUSE THAT ENDING IS NOT OKAY IN THE BEST WAYYYYYYY

I don't think Ive ever read anything quite like this book before.
It really pushes the limits of the genre, introducing things that are quite alien yet feel of home.
While this book is action-packed, and follows a great storyline, it also focuses heavily on relationships.
I loved the relationship between Bea and Nadim and Zara, as well as the relationship that you could slowly see forming between Nadim and Zara.
Its definitely a book that left me thinking for awhile after finishing it, because its new and different yet beckons of what the future of books have to offer.
This was not just a trailblazing book, however. It features a diverse cast of characters, amazing female friendship, and an unusual romance. The book was entertaining as well as something thoughtful. It balanced the two well.
Its definitely a strange story, but it works.

28955,4898,864,"This was my first Francesca Zappia book and I found the story amazing and emotional and the characters touching and relatable. I found myself at a loss for words when I knew I had to write a review because there are some books you can't sum up in a large or small amount of words. The best books make you feel something, even if the book doesn't speak out about impending issues, even if the story itself is just so beautiful you can't help but love it.
Eliza and Her Monsters was one of those stories, I came out of it feeling something. Eliza was such a strong character, very real and very relatable. She overcame some really tough obstacles and faced a lot of pain and came out the other side amazing.
This story seems like it would be about the romance, or a guy swooping in, but it's about a girl with a passion who, in her own way, saves herself.
The romance is very cute and very wonderful and VERY shippable. Wallace has his own flaws but they really loved each other and I loved how even the relationship wasn't perfect. It had its flaws, but at the heart they bother really loved each other.
Gimme a sec her because we have GOT to talk about Emmy. She's apparently 14. IN COLLEGE. And also she's basically a BADASS yo. She's everything I want to be. Like seriously. BEST CHARACTER (maybe) (idk bc they're all amazeballs)
The world felt very real, and I feel like a lot of that was due to Wheelhouse Turn. It definitely added a little character to the town which helped the story SO MUCH.
also I feel like this was extra relatable for me, because I spent ages 9-13.5 dedicating all my free time to an online forum and honestly those were some of the best friends I ever had. It helped me through a really tough time of transition where I moved to a new continent and the people on the forum were all the friends I had. Even though I don't go on the forum much anymore, I still check in, and honestly I don't even know if I'd still be alive right now without that forum carrying me through and pointing me to where I needed to really fall.
SHEESH, THAT GOT DEEP Y'ALL.
Eliza and her Monsters was delectably written, with badass characters, and a story that really hits home

28962,1789,626,"Blooms historical fiction novel tells of the lesbian relationship between First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and first friend Lorena Hickok. The story timeline includes Lorenas coverage of FDRs presidential campaign in 1932, to the time of his death and up until the death of Eleanor herself.

This story, told in Lorenas voice is also a story of her complicated and abusive past as well as her fight to make it on her own. Her many opportunities along the way would not have been so obviously presented in todays world so her meeting a woman like Eleanor is remarkable in itself. Lorenas poor upbringing sits in opposition to Eleanors privileged one yet makes these two women far more interesting together than they might have been apart. Eleanor, the great love of Lorenas life, does at times seem more of a deterrent to the success she might have otherwise achieved. Eleanors charm and ability to attract a wide variety of people is a central theme in both Hickoks attraction to Eleanor and her jealousy in having to share her with a larger audience. She respects Franklin but also views him as a rival for Eleanors time and affection.

Blooms meticulous research elevates this story into something that lies between fiction and non-fiction. So real does the story line come across that knowing that these are indeed real people makes one forget that this is a novel. It does lack a certain excitement however the writing is impeccable and the story comes through with a certain quiet deliberation.

28967,3453,626,"Amy Bloom offers a different perspective on public life vs personal secrets in ""White Houses."" The fictional account of a relationship between First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and journalist Lorena Hickok may take some readers by surprise.

The novel is written from the perspective of Hickok, nicknamed Hick, as she tells of her time as the secret lover and confidante of an extremely protected, yet vulnerable wife of the president. There are few explicit sex scenes, and the reader is left with a candid, while fictionalized, look into the relationship from a personal, emotional point of view.

In the modern world of no-holds-barred social media and publicity frenzy, ""White Houses"" steps back into time when private lives could be led and enjoyed. Kudos to the author for taking a brave and about-time look at love from a different angle.

28971,2465,626,"For those not in the know, Franklin D. Roosevelt was the handsome but polio-ridden President who vanquished the Depression in 1930s America with his New Deal and steered the country through the Second World War. His wife Eleanor was a plain woman but fiercely intelligent and a force to be reckoned with. Theirs was a marriage of convenience; privately, they seemed to have led separate lives.

This novel is a roman  clef about the enduring friendship between Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok, later known as Hick. What starts off as a smartly written glimpse of their special relationship very quickly veers off into Lorenas back story. From a wretched childhood and cast off at the age of thirteen by her abusive father, Lorena goes from household skivvy to college graduate and thence to journalism via a stint at the circus. (Circuses are anathema to me so I was pleased this part of the book didn't go on too long.)

As the wise-ass older newspaperwoman, Hick is given some great lines by the author. Im giving up subtlety. Its never done anything for me. Turning fifty seems to have flattened my moral high ground, like a great left hook. Amy Bloom handles the womens relationship with insight and a kind of ballsy delicacy (if you can imagine such a thing). She peppers the plot with fascinating glimpses of FDR and various gruesome members of his family who all seemed to feel that entitlement went along with the name of Roosevelt.

One very interesting aspect of White Houses is the secrecy that had to be maintained at all cost. The fact that both Franklin and Eleanor craved female companionship outside of their marriage would have been unforgiveable (and in Eleanors case, even incomprehensible) to most of Americas voting public in those years. Nowadays, of course, one's choice of sexual partner doesn't raise so much as an eyebrow. But the infidelity implicit in the open marriage of a power couple would not, I think, please voters - even today.

28979,1560,1498,"Angela has a history. She was kidnapped and held for three years against her will. She bore a child to her kidnapper and only found freedom when a second woman was taken to build the family. The traumatic episode has been consigned to history and she continues into her future without really addressing the impact such an experience might have had on her. Her parents too behaved as though nothing untoward had happened and decide to move on. Yet her kidnap is like a cloud in the present, it is potentially a dangerous secret that will need careful handling in any marriage.

Angela  the eponymous wife of the title  sets up a catering business in the Hamptons after her release, where she meets her husband to be, the squeaky clean and wealthy Jason, an economics Professor. They move to a carriage house in Manhattan where no-one is aware of her tragic past. She has really scored with Jason, who is involved in various businesses, one of which supplies clean water to developing nations. Hes simply a good guy, he takes care of his family, they can afford an amazing house in a swanky part of the city, he doesnt stir the muddy waters of her past. Quite blissful, really, until there is an accusation of sexual misconduct against him. It simply will not go away and is then compounded by fresh allegation from another woman.

Surely her loving husband cannot be a perpetrator of serious sexual crimes? Who can she believe?

This is an excellent story that moves the goalposts, subtly and effectively, as the offences are examined by the police and the judiciary. Could Jason really be guilty? Surely two women wouldnt fabricate stories? Where does the truth lie.

A gripping and telling story so pertinent for our times, and a little look behind the shuttered lives of New Yorkers.

Linda Howard has always been a favorite of mine. Some of her titles are more romance, and others are more adventure, but I always enjoy them.

In this one, the adventure, the Go Team and the training for it, is the focus. I enjoyed the idea of a woman in the training for the teams and the push and pull between getting her trained and making sure that she was physically able to handle the rigors of the training.

Jina and Ace are attracted to one another from the start, but as he is her team leader, he is not willing to allow himself to pursue that attraction. It's an interesting issue, as there is a real reason that it is not appropriate for him to have feelings for her, and the tension of this is real...and it makes it an interesting ""why they can't but want to"" for a large portion of the title.

While most of the book is about them not being together, once they finally are, it feels like the entire book is focused on them, so the pay off for the waiting is definitely there and worth it.

Fans of crime fiction are those readers most likely to enjoy this entertaining novel and will close the book feeling pretty good that someone like Polly has not been part of our life, so far.

28990,4898,2344,"From the start to finish, this book was impeccably written. So much seems to have gone into it and it has turned out a masterpiece.
Beauty and the Beast retellings are hard to write. Books are hard to write. The problem with the Beauty and the Beast is that, if written wrong, can be construed as a Stockholm Syndrome-esque romance. Yet this book turned out, well, amazing. This story is a vibrant, slow burning romance that is unlike any other book I've read.
It's hard to explain without the aide of spoilers, but trust me; you want to read it. The characters fly off the page and the plot and story will keep you reading long after midnight. The tale that Meagan Spooner spins has the darkness of other worlds, the whimsy of a fairytale, and an inventive spin on a tale as old as time.
The beauty and the beast has always been one of my favorite fairytales. I think what always drew me in was that it featured a princess of intelligence. One that didn't get where she was with her looks. She was selfless and well-learned and brave. All of these qualities transferred well to the Beauty in this story. She was willing to do anything to save the people she loved. Face anything, kill anything, live with anything. And while she was beautiful, I think her intelligence was what really made her beautiful.
We need more heirones with the beauty of intelligence.

28992,269,3679,"This memoir is surprisingly good.  While Jimmy Yang writes with deprecating humor, he also describes the trials and tribulations of a young immigrant determined to make it big in Hollywood as a stand-up.  He couldn't have picked a more difficult profession to get into.

Yang's story starts out simple enough:  he's 13-years-old and speaks no English.  All he knows about America is what he watched on TV in Hong Kong:  Americans are white, thin, and cool.  He can't even answer a girl's ""What's Up?"" when he arrives in Los Angeles.  His parents enroll him at a posh Beverly Hills high school using his grandparent's address.  All his dad wants from him is to work hard in school, graduate from college, and work at a prestigious financial firm.  Yang's goals are nowhere near his dad's goals for him.

The memoir explains the difference between Chinese and American values.  Education and wealth are important to Chinese families.  In the United States, making a lot of money is the meaning of success.  All Yang wants to do is make it big as a stand-up comic.  I have to give him credit for fulfilling his dream.  Yang ate a lot of crow before he made it big.

There are ten chapters in this book.  All the chapters begin with ""How To.""  How to Asian, How to Immigrant, How to ThugLife. How to Get High.  One touching chapter for me is ""How to Stand Up"" as this chapter shows how comedians make it big in Hollywood, by taking low-paying or no-paying jobs just for the limelight.  Yang did plenty of no-paying jobs just for the recognition.  He worked with many other stand-up comics stuffing envelopes, working in strip clubs, working as used car salesmen, living in the living room of one very gay callboy.

While he does use the ""F"" bomb on occasion, I found this memoir sensitively written.  Yang wants to be a stand-up comedian, but he also wants to please his father.  His family is important to him. He finally makes it big on the HBO series ""Silicon Valley."" He becomes an American citizen. The father-son relationship comes full circle in the end.  I chuckled throughout, and in the end I shed a few tears.  Yang made it big and tells it all in this book without bad-mouthing others and giving kudos to those who helped him along the way.

29014,2032,842,"Fatal Threat: The Fatal Series Book 11 is by Marie Force.  The story of Vice-President Nick Cappuano and his wife Samantha continues in this book.  Amazingly, the series has not become boring as the Marie hits book 11.
Lieutenant Samantha Holland (also known as Mrs. Nick Cappuano, Second Lady of the United States), had been called to the scene of a body floating in the Anacostia River.  She was unhappy at being called out just to wait to see if it was a homicide nor not and the hot weather was not helping.  As she and her partner approached the crime scene, four men approached the barrier asking for her.  Before she could find out anything about them, she had been whisked away by the Secret Service without any explanation. She cannot get any answers from them about her husband who is overseas in Iran.  Had something happened to him?  Eventually, she finds herself in an underground safe house with her son and her extended family.  All had been brought here with no explanation. Along with them was Alex, the infant son of Sams colleague Gonzo who had been in her sister Angelas care that day.  They have no idea how long they will be held here nor can they notify anyone outside.  They cant even arrange for Alex to be taken to his parents.  As time passes, Samantha begins to lose her patience. How long before they are told anything?
Finally, after Nick arrives from Iran, they are told what happened.  Nicks office had received a threatening letter which threatens to physically harm one of Nicks family with an immediate threat of hurting the children.  They had no way of knowing what was going on with Nick out of the States, so Nick authorized them to pick up his family and take them to safety.  However, he didn't know to make sure they were advised as to the situation as soon as they arrived.
Who is threatening their family and why?

I found the assignment given to Chee, guarding a mediator at a conference regarding a development at the Grand Canyon, to be as boring as the conference must have been.  I'm also not happy with the way the characters are developing.  For instance, spirituality and Navajo culture were extremely important to Chee who, at one time, contemplated becoming a medicine man.  This aspect of his life is no longer even mentioned.  It also appears that Anne's books will feature Bernie as the main character but Chee and Leaphorn should not be relegated to lesser positions as they were in this book.  I miss the depth of their wisdom and hope that future books emphasize them and flesh them out.

29044,4144,117,"Before I dig in, please note, this is a 4.5 star review. I hope to make this the last review of a Joe Hill book where I make the inevitable comparisons to his father's work. All I will say is, I am pleased the franchise will continue for many years to come. That is not to say that Hill does not have his own voice but the similarities in style and subject matter are undeniable.

This was a strong and entertaining quartet of stories. I encourage you to read the author's afterword. He covers the value in rich brevity rather than droning length in storytelling. He highlights the value of novellas. I couldn't agree more. I especially love short stories. Consider John Cheever's ""Reunion"". It weighs in at an anemic 1,400 words but the story packs a punch that will leave you reeling if not knocking you flat on the floor.

Hill's stories in ""Strange Weather"" pack their own punches. The first, ""Snapshot"", was initially perplexing but its resolution (all pun intended) was compelling. A creepy guy goes around taking pictures on an instant camera that never existed. It could have come ""From a Buick 8"" (an inside joke that King family fans will get).

The most disturbing and topical of the entries is ""Loaded"". It tackles the right-to-guns debate in America. I happened to read it as the events at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida took place. More accurately, where 17 people were killed. Hill and his father are decidedly Democratic in their leanings as you can tell from social media and their writing. However, Hill puts a chill down your spine with the last line in this story. It brilliantly captures the conundrum America now finds itself in.

""Aloft"" was the most fun of all these romps. The premise is inventive...while skydiving what if you ended up on a cloud that is firm enough to stand on and explore? There is much more going on than you can first predict. Enough said. Anything more moves into spoiler territory. In the last entry, Hill imagines a near apocalyptic event. Now you imagine that when it rains, deadly nails of crystal fall from the sky. While the imagery is rich and the characters colourful, this is more of a detective story.

29045,2514,3790,"FirstI heard the controversy surrounding this book.  Something so egregious that people were cancelling their pre-orders!  What was it?  How could one of my favorite authors turn a phrase so appalling that people would not like her work?  I soldiered on, and found, nothing, not a thing that made me not want to read this book.  More on that later.

Hello Stranger is Ethan and Garretts book.  Ive like the lead up to these characters story in the previous Ravenel books.  A completely different premise than other historical novels, with Garrett being the first female physician in England, loosely based on a real person.  I enjoyed the medical information and always enjoy the political intrigue and behind the scenes double dealing that still happens today!

I will agree that the book was a bit plodding in some places and is not as good as some of the previous Ravenel family storyline.  But all in all, Im giving it 4.5 stars.  Not perfect, but not something I wouldnt want to read.  I loved the excerpt from the next book, too!

The controversy I alluded to earlier, has to do with one scene.  It is historically accurate in my opinion, and shouldnt have drawn so much attention.  It could have been left out entirely without harming the story.  Ms. Kleypas has promised to change the wording, or perhaps will just take it out.",1520640000,4,firsti heard controversi surround book someth egregi peopl cancel preorder could one favorit author turn phrase appal peopl would like work soldier found noth thing made want read book later hello stranger ethan garrett book ive like lead charact stori previou ravenel book complet differ premis histor novel garrett first femal physician england loo base real person enjoy medic inform alway enjoy polit intrigu behind scene doubl deal still happen today agre book bit plod place good previou ravenel famili storylin im give 45 star perfect someth wouldnt want read love excerpt next book controversi allud earlier one scene histor accur opinion shouldnt drawn much attent could left entir without harm stori m kleypa promis chang word perhap take

29049,1594,3831,"I have only read a few books in the series, but I am glad I read this one. The first thing that drew me to this book was the lovely cover. This book starts off with a bang when Theodosia (Theo) and her good friend and tea sommelier, Drayton Conneley, are viewing the the citys Gaslights and Galleons Parade event. Sailing ships from around the world are converging on Charleston and the pair have been invited to view it from the widow's walk of one of the spectacular mansions situated on the route. When one of the guests appears to have been shot and falls from the widow's walk during the event, Theodosia jumps in right away. She ends up chasing a person who she thinks is responsible through the B & B next door. When its reinforced that it was a murder and not a horrible accident, Theo's friend asks her to poke around and see if she can come up with some suspects. This is a busy time of year in Charleston with the Cat Show and the accompanying Hair Ball, The Ancient Guns and Weapons Show, a Fashion Show at her ""friend"" Delaine's boutique and the Garden Club's Plum Blossom Tea that Theo and her staff are kept hopping. Somewhere in there, she has time to make a new friend, Alexis, who has opened a Japanese Gallery down the street and to investigate the murder.

Theos supportive friends are there to help her out from Drayton to Haley, the talented shops chef, and Haleys young nephew, Jamie. The supporting characters are well thought out and add fun to the storyline. Theos relationship with Detective Pete Riley helped her to gather some facts and I find it refreshing that he doesnt demand that she stop snooping. There were some laugh out loud moments in the book that I enjoyed as well. I thought I figured out who the murderer was and I was right, but the reveal was well done and tied up all the loose ends. I enjoyed this story and will probably go back and read some of the ones that I have missed. I will also try a couple of the recipes included in the back. If you are a tea lover, there are also some Tea Time Tips and links for Tea Resources, which you might want to check out. I received a copy of this book from the First To Read  Program.

29050,1339,3831,"Laura Childs once again has a hit on her hands. In book nineteen in the Tea Shop Mystery, Theodosia is shocked to find a murdered banker. At first, people believed that the live canons had killed him and caused him to fall onto a fence below but Theodosia soon learns that he was first shot by an arrow before he fell to his death.

This time, there are quite a lot of suspects that could have done this and Childs does a fantastic job of circling the characters and giving each one of them a solid motive. What I love about Childs writing is that she doesnt waste any time in getting the story started. Within the first few pages, the murder occurs, setting the quick pace for the rest of the book. For me, its the expert pacing that makes me devour these books so quickly. I read this in one sitting, proving that this book is very easy to follow yet offers the intricacy of an expert mystery.

For anyone who is curious about this series, this one does have a bit of an English touch to it. This is expected since the series is about tea. However, in this book, the Asian countries do get some recognition so I really liked that as well.

Although this series is long-running, you can definitely read this series out of order. Just make sure you at least try Laura Childs if you're into Cozy Mysteries.

29051,4719,3169,"In Book 2 which was so much better than Book 1
I became a have to read the entire series. Onto Book 3, in the meantime...review:

This was scary beyond the word scary. I honestly hate reading books on satanic killings, especially when they're detailed, but thank God, Scott did not go into complete morbid details. I hate when children, Christians, basically anyone is killed by satanic means. it's very hard to explain but it was hard to read and especially listen, yet as always the good always overcomes evil.

No matter how you feel about what I just wrote, I highly recommend reading & listening if you have Kindle Unlimited or not! I read/listened in less than a day. I usually listen to books to help me sleep, this was not one of them. I suggest sitting down, work around the house, however, you read/listen..NOT AT BEDTIME.

I was only a little setback on why Joe Dillard, who was a criminal defense attorney in book 1 was on a task force to find these killers in Book 2? So I hope his defense attorney comes back. There is one killer, not associated with these killers from Book 1 that was an extremely hated individual...you'll be a bit pleased about his outcome. Definitely 5 stars!!!

Again I adore narrator Tim Campbell, maybe because I know so much about him, and I don't like bad reviews against him. Yet I see why some can't get past his monotone characters. It really has to do with his sad feelings just about everything, including himself, the murders & family. So I love you, Tim!!

29052,96,3824,"The Poet X is a standalone Young Adult novel told in verse.

The narrator is almost 16 year old Xiomara. She lives with her parents and twin brother in Harlem.

Her mom is very religious and she makes her do a lot of church stuff. But all Xiomara (pronounced C. O. Mara) wants to do is write poetry in her notebook.

This is such a unique way to tell a story. But I was not sure if I would like it. But the story was very meaningful. And I could definitely understand exactly what the story was about.

Xiomara goes through a lot of stuff that I'm sure a lot of teenagers deal with. And I loved how she expressed herself through poetry. The book is also about slam poetry, which I loved.

The book is a much quicker read than the 368 pages would make it seem.

Overall, I definitely enjoyed this book. Xiomara's mom was definitely extremely tough on her. And that bothered me. However, I thought that Xiomara's teacher was wonderful. And I was fascinated by everything to do with the slam poetry. The book does feature some romance. And that was a nice part of the story. I also really enjoyed Xiomara's brother and her best friend. This is a very original and different way to tell a story. I really liked it!

29054,4181,162,"3.5 stars. Five years since Florence Flora Dane was rescued from her kidnapper who held her for 472 days, she finds herself naked, with her hands bound, inside of what she presumes to be a garage belonging to the bartender who knocked her unconscious earlier.
Since her kidnapping over 6 years ago till now, Flora learned a very important lesson, how to survive.
With her quick thinking, drive to not be a victim again, and her now knowledge of self defense, she sets out in the garage to find anything she can use to her disposal to help her escape. At that point she finds just what she needs in order to attack her captor and flee, except she accidentally kills him, or was it not an accident at all?
Upon being detained after the police arrive, Flora contacts her old acquaintance from the FBI who brings her home. After the night she had, she goes to rest, except shes not seen from again.
By the time a local detective with the Boston PD comes to check in, its obvious that Flora, who was keen on any and every security measure, even the numerous locks, deadbolts and chains on her door, is once again kidnapped, this time from her apartment and not a bar in Florida during Spring Break.
The book then begins to follow the past life of Flora during her days of captivity by her first kidnapper and switches back and forth between her life currently and her present situation being kidnapped and locked away, again, and the life of the detective who has been assigned her case and needs to find her before its too late.
As new details come into play, there is so much more than meets the eye and innocent Flora might not be so innocent after-all.

Although the story only truly began picking up a little over halfway through, it was a read that truly captured my interest and made it worth it at the end.
The way that Floras story unravels over the course of the book gives you insight into just how much a person can be broken down before they are left with absolutely nothing and just how easy it is to sculpt them into whatever you want them to be.
The fact that Flora finds herself kidnapped not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES, goes to show that she has literally the worst luck in the world.
When you feel like you finally got it all figured out, a new detail comes forward and your perception begins to shift the completely opposite direction.
Despite this being the 8th installment in the Detective D.D. Warren series , you are not missing out on anything of importance that would hinder the books storyline. I am now interested in reading the other 7 books in the D.D. Warren series.
At the end of the book, you realize that every single one of us has our own demons, do you know yours?",1520640000,3,35 star five year sinc florenc flora dane rescu kidnapp held 472 day find nake hand bound insid presum garag belong bartend knock unconsci earlier sinc kidnap 6 year ago till flora learn import lesson surviv quick think drive victim knowledg self defens set garag find anyth use dispos help escap point find need order attack captor flee except accident kill accid upon detain polic arriv flora contact old acquaint fbi bring home night goe rest except she seen time local detect boston pd come check obviou flora keen everi secur measur even numer lock deadbolt chain door kidnap time apart bar florida spring break book begin follow past life flora day captiv first kidnapp switch back forth life current present situat kidnap lock away life detect assign case need find late new detail come play much meet eye innoc flora might

29056,4421,3850,"While its been four years since the last book, Restore Me takes place just 16 days after the events of Ignite Me. We are put back into this world in the midst of Juliette trying to establish her rule as Supreme Commander. This requires her to balance relationships between herself, her friends, Sector 45, and the rest of the world. Unsurprisingly, Restore Me is beautifully and eloquently written. Tahereh Mafis way with words has always been a huge selling point for this series.

The last book ended in a series of rapid events which, I felt, left a lot unresolved. So I really enjoyed the fact that the beginning of this books focuses on resolving some of those issues. This also allows for some much-needed development for certain characters and relationships. This book also features a level of hilarity that can only come from a bunch of teenagers trying to run the county and I am HERE for it.

Unfortunately, Restore Me also brings back one of the aspects of the original trilogy that I loathe. That aspect is Juliettes attitude. Juliette still makes me want to shake her because she doesnt listen! Her actions in this book remind me of why I honestly didn't enjoy Shatter Me. Yes, she was mistreated but so was literally every other character in this book! She always acts like a dramatic spoiled brat and thinks everyone is deliberately plotting against her and it's infuriating.

Yet she stays and he staysdrawn to this mysterious redhead whose quiet stillness both unnerves and excites him. Over the course of a punishing summer, Polly and Adam abandon themselves to a steamy, inexorable affair. Still, each holds something back from the otherdangerous, even lethal, secrets.

  Then someone dies. Was it an accident, or part of a plan? By now, Adam and Polly are so ensnared in each others lives and lies that neither one knows how to get awayor even if they want to. Is their love strong enough to withstand the truth, or will it ultimately destroy them?
  Somethingor someonehas to give.

  Which one will it be?

My Thoughts: From the very first page of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunburn-A-Novel/dp/B0727T88KQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunburn: A Novel</a>, the reader is drawn into the mysterious connection that seems to develop immediately between Adam and Polly.

Circumstances brought them together, but desire and the slow burn of secrets and lies would keep them connectedfor one long hot summer and beyond.

Who is Polly? We learn bits and pieces of her life and her past as the tale progresses. Their alternating narratives fill in the story over time. Is she a con artist bent on destruction? Or is she someone with a plan and unexpected goals?

Additional layers revealed complexities I didn't see coming until the very end.

Fascinating story with interesting characters, some of whom were evil and destructive. But I liked both Adam and Polly and rooted for them. Would either of them get what they wanted from the relationship? Would they abandon their original goals? Or would life and someones manipulations throw too many curves for either of them to win?

29060,1781,3831,"As always the author delivers a scrumptious story filled with murder, mystery and a  wonderful assortment of teas to try out.  The characters are classy and intriguing. It's not long into the story until a murder occurs which sets in motion an adventure that is like a cat and mouse game. I simply adore Theodosia. She is charming and has a knack for finding out information very cleverly. I would love to sit with her at her shop and sip tea and eat scones . I could visualize the beautiful and delicate tea cups and setting that is calming and inviting.

The victim is a surprise to some in the town, but his enemies start to line up in this fast paced story.  The author captures the untimely death with a very unexpected fall and ends with a painful injury that was vividly described. Someone sure wanted to make sure our victim was dead. I really like the theme in cozy mysteries where there is a detective dating or married to the person who eventually figures out who the killer is. Riley is a very smart detective who happens to be dating none other than Theodosia. I liked how he at times seemed to be exasperated by Theodosia's interference in the investigation. I had to laugh when she continued to bombard him with questions that he knew he shouldn't answer.

If you have ever witnessed a physical fight between two women, you know it can be funny at times. The scene that the author writes between the wife and mistress of the deceased is nothing short of hysterical and over the top entertaining. It is probably not a great idea to invite them both to an event unless you are prepared for fireworks to go off. The fight has tongues wagging as it becomes front page news. Theodosia can add two more suspects to her ever growing list after this escapade.

The more Theodosia delves into the mystery, the more her life is in danger along with her friends and associates. Someone is not happy that Theodosia is involved in the investigation and is pulling out all the stops to encourage her to not play detective. The story is very well written and had me on the edge of my chair till the end. I loved the twists and turns and suspense as the author leaves a trail of subtle hints to the killer's identity. I love the way the author is able to give such precise details of weapons and the history behind some of them.

The more I read the book, I realized how talented the author is. She can weave a tale of mystery that captures your attention right away, while enticing you with witty sayings like, ""Sweet Fanny Adams,"" or ""You're like a danger magnet.""  I love that she can make you laugh while still adding intense drama to the story. The ending is one you don't want to miss as it reaches a level of  high danger for Theodosia. Don't miss this wonderful addition to A Tea Shop Mystery Series that is Laura Childs at her best.

29072,677,3822,"With The Hunger, Alma Katsu does for the doomed Donner party what Dan Simmons did for the Franklin Expedition in his massive work, The Terror, giving the ill-fated cross-country voyage a supernatural twist while maintaining historical authenticity (well, to a degree anyway).

In May 1846, a group of American pioneers set out for California in a wagon train led by George Donner and James Reed. Their journey was beset by a number of problems and delays, which ultimately caused them to be stuck in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada during the start of an early and very harsh winter, and with barely any supplies left. Starving and stranded, the travelers wee forced to resort to cannibalism in order to survive.

Or did they?

Katsu gives the historical record a slight twerk, and while she works tightly within the confines of what we know of the Donner party she still manages to deliver an interesting alternative, threading in a fine line of horror that weaves its way through the expedition and culminates in a savage finale. The Hunger is a slow-burn work of quiet horror, one that draws on Native American folklore to deliver moments of hearty suspense in several well-depicted scenes of terror.

What makes the horror truly effective, though, is the cast of characters Katsu focuses on. The supernatural threat is well depicted, but the Donner party itself is a microcosm of horrors and threats all its own. Taking a group of people and thrusting them into a situation, in this case a months-long journey, that slowly breaks down and decays their trust in one another is fraught with its own perils. Tacking on a mysterious horror lurking in the dark, stalking them across the plains and the Great Salt Lake Desert and up into the snowy, impassable mountains of the Sierra Nevada only serves to amplify the frayed nerves of both the Donner party and readers alike.

While I dug the heck out of The Hunger and appreciate its gentle reminder that I really do need to read more works of historical horror in this vein, I do wish Katsu had spent more time on the grislier affairs this expedition is best known for. An awful lot of anticipation is built toward these travelers' final months, and while it's all very necessary and quite well-told, we're short shrifted by the time December and January 1847 roll around. I will admit, though, that I am a bit of a gore hound, and one that has perhaps been spoiled by small press horror titles that aren't afraid to dive headlong into the darkness. I found myself wondering what Jack Ketchum would do with this book's climax, and I wish Katsu would have been more willing to deliver on the depravity she'd spent so long building toward. I really wanted to see her dig into the blood and guts of it all and get her hands filthy. After nearly 300+ pages, the finale is too much telling and not enough showing, and feels practically weightless in light of all that came before.

This reservation aside, though, The Hunger was ultimately satisfying despite a climax that didn't forcefully enough deliver on the promise of Alma Katsu's premise. Had there been more pages devoted to exploring and fleshing out the last few grisly months of the Donner party, this could have easily been a five-star read for me. In the end, it feels like too much was glossed over for the sake of playing it safe, which is unfortunate to say the least. Still, the characters are superb and have engaging histories, and there are some worthwhile shocks along the way that give The Hunger plenty of intrigue to keep the pages turning.

I was just so affected by Turtles story, by her super dark and intense story. I loved how instead of using first person narration or having the characters talk about feelings Tallent let the emotions come through in the characters actions (particularly Turtle, constantly cleaning her guns, but also Martin opening his morning beer or Jacobs family taking Turtle shopping for bras). It was written in a unique way that I found unexpectedly satisfying. Its a coming of age story, a bit of a thriller even, and a close look at a deeply troubled/abusive father/daughter relationship. Its not a fun book and its not an easy one, and I think some (honest but difficult to read) elements of the subject matter (abuse, incest) could be too much for some readers.

29081,238,3863,"If you've read Timothy Snyder's ""Black Earth,"" you know that Snyder is not afraid to be relentlessly negative in pursuit of the truth. That makes for powerful books, but like many books that examine our recent history, it will not be even slightly 'enjoyable.' That's not a bad thing, but since I read to relax as well as inform, it can be wearisome - but I also want to be informed - but I want to relax - but....So it's a tough balance.

I'm up to date on current events and came to this research already converted to Snyder's primary thesis, that Russia has rather ingeniously used our national paranoia, racism, fear, anger, and social media-driven madness against ourselves. You have to give Russia a lot of credit - we all acted like we won the Cold War, but nobody told the Russians to stop fighting. It's hard to be upset at the idea of being defeated by an enemy so much smarter than we are.

The problem, of course, is we don't have the luxury of knowing how all this turned out - since we're living through this mess right now. So the book can't end as anything more than a warning to how it will probably get worse. I think those who will appreciate Snyder's fairly deep examination of Trump-Russia ties have already chosen the right side. I don't know if a book like this serves to change minds, or even if it's that its intention. Mostly, the book was infuriating because it was identifying venality, corruption, and exploitation of politicians, but especially the dark rottenness at the heart of most Americans. We're not really a good civilization - we're ""advanced,"" which is not the same thing. Never mind that Russia, which used the same kind of conspiratorial ""populist"" messages in Ukraine, and exploited in Europe, is better at social media than we are - and we invented it! So I'm not sure how ""advanced"" we are either.

I've been reading lots of books in this vein lately, and taken together they give no good path forward.",1520640000,4,youv read timothi snyder black earth know snyder afraid relentlessli neg pursuit truth make power book like mani book examin recent histori even slightli enjoy that bad thing sinc read relax well inform wearisom also want inform want relax butso tough balanc im date current event came research alreadi convert snyder primari thesi russia rather ingeni use nation paranoia racism fear anger social mediadriven mad give russia lot credit act like cold war nobodi told russian stop fight hard upset idea defeat enemi much smarter problem cours dont luxuri know turn sinc live mess right book cant end anyth warn probabl get wors think appreci snyder fairli deep examin trumprussia tie alreadi chosen right side dont know book like serv chang mind even intent mostli book infuri identifi venal corrupt exploit politician especi dark rotten heart american realli good civil advanc thing never mind russia use kind conspiratori populist messag ukrain exploit

29085,3194,846,"This was my first venture into the world of Harry Hole. As other reviewers have noted, there is quite a deal of talk about how The Bat, and the subsequent next in the series, Cockroaches, were less than stellar in comparison to the series as a whole.

In The Bat, Harry is dispatched to help solve the murder case of Inger Holter, a young Norwegian woman. With the backdrop of Australia, Harry and his investigative team attempt to trace down evidence and clue that lead to the identity of the murderer.

Many reviewers who dislike the book complain about the incessant asides from characters about Australian travel or culture that seem a tad too forced. While characters seemingly breaking into spontaneous monologues about myths, legends or folklore was a bit distracting, it was not my biggest complaint. My biggest complain stems from a rather lackluster leading character in Hole--who comes across as unsympathetic and without much substance-- and a rather ridiculous direction to the novel. By all means a character can have faults (in fact, this is what gives them substance), but I felt a sense of indifference to Harry the further I read into this book. As far as the direction the book takes, it ventures into an absurd level of over the top action/violence that borders on silly and a general convolutedness that seemingly takes over the novel in the final stretches. And the ending alone, I mean, come on.

Something tells me the overall negative consensus for this book could be due to either a translation issue with this book, or simply that Nesbo was trying to find his footing with this character and the series.

At any rate, as the novel wore on, I like it less and less. Ill probably have to wait before trying to pick it up again, but I do hear good things about The Snowman.

Louisa Clark has arrived.  In New York that is. Her old friend Nathan has gotten her a job as an assistant to Agnes Gopnik, a wealthy married woman who has trouble fitting in and who more than anything, needs a friend.  For Louisa its an opportunity.  To see the world and to do what Will always told her to do.  And this time, Louisa takes it.  New York.  NEW YORK.

For Lou however, moving to New York has brought about lots of challenges.  Lou has to leave Sam - her new boyfriend and though they agreed to try a long distance relationship - it turns out to be quite the bumpy ride, but then with Louisa, youd expect nothing less.  While in New York, Louisa meets someone, a man who reminds her of her Will and it throws Louisa for a loop, and when Sam sees him, it throws him for one too.

New York is both everything and nothing like Louisa Clark expected.  She has to fight for what she wants and fight hard and in doing so Louisa finally finds what she has been lacking, her sense of self.

In my opinion, Still Me by Jojo Moyes far surpassed After You.  Though nothing compares to the first book in the series, Me Before You, I am glad that I continued on and read about Louisa Clarks next adventure as there is something utterly endearing about Ms. Clark. I listened to the audiobook of this novel and it rocked.  I highly recommend it.

This says quite a bit as I was ready to give up on the series prior to reading Dunbar, and now Macbeth.

Nesbo kept the feel of a Shakespeare tragedy with a spin of a more modern day setting.  In this case it was the 1970's with a definite vibe to that era without pop culture overload.  Originally written  in Norwegian, this novel didn't appear to have anything lost during translation. The dialogue captured the essence of Shakespeare perfectly.

29118,3233,914,"This was so, so lovely I couldn't help but read it all in one sitting. It's so classically Laini Taylor and I loved it. This is going to be another one of those 'I loved it so much that I have basically nothing to say' reviews!

1. The characters. I've read Taylor's other popular series, Daughter of Smoke and Bone, and the same sort of principle applies there. She has this amazing ability to build truly complex characters. No one in this book is perfect and those that are seen as heroes have committed their own personal horrors but they aren't shamed in any way. Instead, the characters are whole and they try to muddle through their own troubles. Even the ultimate 'villain' isn't really a villain once you look at their circumstances. One thing that really bothers me, though, is that despite Laini Taylor's ability to make me really understand the characters, I didn't really get attached to any of them and I didn't really feel too much of a blow at the end.

2. The world and it's background. I also loved getting to know this world, especially the city of Weep (or the Unseen City). Like with the characters, there's a complex backstory going on behind the scenes that influences everything and it really is a mystery. The world is just so richly painted and real. Weep has been isolated for 200 years but suddenly, 15 years ago, everything changed and Lazlo has set out to witness the change (view spoiler) I was a bit worried that I'd be walking into an info dump at the beginning because it started to shape up like that but that feeling quickly dissipated.

3. The plot. This book is definitely not action-packed. The whole first half is almost all character driven and it's only in the last 170 pages that things really start to become action driven. Honestly, I loved that the author chose to do this because it's so important to build up the atmosphere of the world in fantasy and that was certainly achieved.

4. The writing. This is my absolute favorite part of the whole reading experience! This book is so amazingly quotable, I have about 30 quotes written in my notebook already. Laini Taylor's writing is just so lush and lyrical and fantastical and beautiful. Even if you're someone who didn't enjoy the story, I can't imagine you wouldn't enjoy the feeling of speaking the sentences out loud. Maybe this is a bookworm thing, but there are so many paragraphs that just sounds beautiful when you read them aloud.

5. The romance. At first, I wasn't really sure about this. There definitely isn't instalove, but I found it to be very quick in terms of it's development. Still, the two are sweet together and I enjoyed reading their scenes. Also, I was pleased to see f/f romance representation but I wish it would have gotten more page time.

29120,4306,2232,"Robert Harriss An Officer and A Spy is a great example of a book that defies a key generality and a personal prejudice.

By definition a novel of historical fiction must be written and read from the understanding that everyone knows the ending. The Titanic will sink, Pearl Harbor will get bombed and Napoleon and the Roman Empire will eventually fall.

Most of us know the broad facts of the Dreyfus Affair. A decade before World War I, the French Army uncovered a spy, what we might now call a mole, within the Army. A Jewish officer, Capt. Dreyfus was found guilty of being this spy, disgraced, sent to a tiny tropical island, Devils Island to suffer a horrendous isolated imprisonment. Later he was exonerated and restored to his rank. Antisemitism as much as any evidence would prove to be the driving force behind his conviction and somehow a letter published by Emile Zola would force France to reconsider the charge. All of this is fairly widely known but very few of us know anything about the specific details. History itself is the spoiler to the plot of Officer and A Spy.

As to my prejudice. Robert Harris has written a meticulously researched version of the people and events leading to Dreyfus reversal of fortune. We are assured that even minor characters existed in reality and were to some degree how they are portrayed. My problem, and it is mine, is that I now know an entertaining version of the events. How much is entertainment and how much is factual? When I do choose to read the actual record, which am I going to remember, the prosaic, unemotional truth, or the dramatic and entertaining fiction? It is to Harris credit, that he will becloud my mind even should I seek to learn the facts.

To some degree the dramatic flow is flattened out by his determination to keep it real. Within this limitation he has written a page turner. Spy is a mystery rather than a spy story. In mood he is compared with the works of Alan Furst. Fursts Night Soldier novels compare in terms of representing good people who accept that they are going to fail, but refusing to stop being good people. The comparison is therefore apt. This is more of a procedural and therefore more like the Le Carre Quest for Karla Novels.

Yes we know the outcome, Harris lays out for us the logical progression that a reluctant, but honorable Col. Georges Picquart, newly promoted and posted to head of French Army Intelligence follows in what becomes for him a search for justice. His every move places him against the interests of the top command, and his reporting Army seniors. The question becomes are these people more worried about their career plans, or in restoring the honor of the Army.

How much of this process is history? We can either do our own research or accept that this is a well told tale. I did have some quibbles about the ability of an Army Intelligence Chief with nothing else to do but to focus on this injustice. Harris makes it clear that there were a number of competing intelligence priorities for his department. But this is a quibble and like my prejudice only my problem.",1520640000,4,robert harris offic spi great exampl book defi key gener person prejudic definit novel histor fiction must written read understand everyon know end titan sink pearl harbor get bomb napoleon roman empir eventu fall u know broad fact dreyfu affair decad world war french armi uncov spi might call mole within armi jewish offic capt dreyfu found guilti spi disgrac sent tini tropic island devil island suffer horrend isol imprison later exoner restor rank antisemit much evid would prove drive forc behind convict somehow letter publish emil zola would forc franc reconsid charg fairli wide known u know anyth specif detail histori spoiler plot offic spi prejudic robert harri written meticul research version peopl event lead dreyfu revers fortun assur even minor charact exist realiti degre portray problem mine know entertain version event much entertain much factual choos read actual record go rememb prosaic unemot truth dramat entertain fiction harri credit becloud mind even seek

29125,731,3266,"While driving in the desert at night, distracted by the most beautiful moon he has ever seen, Dr. Eitan Green hits a man. A brain surgeon, he knows the man will not live. He makes the decision to drive on, leaving the dying man. He won't risk his career by reporting the accident.

He does not know he left behind a clue or that the dying man's wife Sirkit witnessed the accident. She blackmails the doctor: he will spend his nights at a makeshift clinic caring for her fellow Eritrean refugees.

A man who prefers to live in order, who shuns the blood and shit of human frailty, the doctor is thrust into the dirty, ugly side of life. But as he works with the tall, proud woman, he comes to admire her skill and to secretly lust for her.

Dr. Green's wife is a detective on the case of the hit-and-run victim. She struggles with her husband's absence, sure he is not cheating on her, yet sensing something is not right.

Waking Lions by Ayelet Gundar-Goshen, beautifully translated from the Hebrew by Sondra Silverston, is a remarkable novel that probes the complexity of our moral choices. People do bad things or good things, for bad reasons or good ones, culminating in earned or unearned outcomes. It is about power shifts, the prejudice between Israelis, Bedouins, and African Eritreans, the refugee experience, the mystery of never really knowing one another, and how the privileged class can turn away from the uncomfortable and live in a sterile world of their own making.

The story is told by an omniscient narrator who knows the thoughts of the characters, without dialogue. Twists create an unexpectedly propulsive, action, complication.

29139,1339,3852,"As one of my most anticipated books this year, I had some really high expectations for HIGH VOLTAGE. This is the tenth book in the Fever series and it marks the beginning of a new journey for Dani. She walks alone in this book after Ryodan, Mac and Barrons have left. Without any of her friends, she feels lost and alone.

Ill admit, I wasn't a huge fan of Dani when she was first introduced into the series but already she has made so much progress with her character. If youve never read a KMM book before, you're seriously missing out. Her heroines alone are worth the read. Strong and independent, they are perfect role models for any women. Despite being set in a dystopian world filled with magic and fae, the obstacles that these characters go through are very much humanlike and relatable. Danis biggest obstacle here is grief and I found that KMM did such a good job of conveying the emotions and dealing with it.

Ryodan and Danis relationship is just beginning and every time a fight occurs between them, I have to smile. For some reason, it comforts me and makes me happy because it means that things are all right in the world despite things falling apart around them.

I cried while reading this novel. KMMs words always manage to do that to me. The emotions that her characters feel come across as very real and Id be surprised if you weren't affected by them. Im glad Dani is back and we get to see the whole through her eyes again. Because as bleak as it can be, she remains to be the light that brings in hope.

29142,1832,3722,"This is an easy, accessible collection of short stories reminiscent of Sittenfeld's work. Thematically, the stories feel very midlife - about regret and fidelity (in both romance and friendship), missed opportunities and mistaken assumptions.

Generally I like to read short stories one at a time and then let them sink in, but I read these back to back, partly because I was on a plane, and partly because they are easily digestible. That's both a criticism and a compliment: people who don't usually like short stories will enjoy these, but people who are looking for a transformative experience might be disappointed.

However, contradicting myself again, let me say that this is Sittenfeld's gift -she makes it look simple, but there are often deeper levels lurking underneath her work. Though as I sat down to write this I could only remember one story - Plausible Deniability, which I won't describe because there's an early spoiler - when I looked at the table of contents I found strong emotional associations with each one.

29143,3032,1281,"This is a stunning book, which combines the eccentricity of Jeannette Walls' family (The Glass Castle), the paranoid isolation of Mormon-based extremists described by Jon Krakauer (Under the Banner of Heaven) and the psychosexual totalitarianism of a father faced with a maturing daughter (Gabriel Tallent, My Absolute Darling). That is to say, this is a deeply disturbing, excruciatingly honest memoir of a young woman's escape from ignorance parading as religion, and from near-absolute geographical isolation to modern cosmopolitanism. It costs her everything but her self. Her parents and siblings suffer, mainly at the hands of her father, but also because of their deluded view of human free will and their utter ignorance of the world. Somehow -- and this is the memoir -- she survives and is born into a better world. Tara Westover must be a marvel. She writes beautifully and without mercy for herself. She willed herself to intellectual and personal freedom with the help of mentors and friends. And she succeeds, but in the painful way that leaves scars for life. Really a remarkable book.

It is your greatest fear and It has been terrorizing Derry for decades but for Bill Denbrough and six of his friends it starts in 1958 when Bills little brother Georgie is murdered violently. Georgies murder is just the start of a string of violent child murders that Bill and his friends feel compelled to investigate. An invisible and powerful force that binds them together leads them into an epic battle of good versus evil which they mistakenly believe they have won. Twenty seven years later they must once again face It and this time It is determined to win.

I enjoyed this book because King created a unique and interesting monster and spun a really fascinating tale about how evil can inhabit many forms and manifest in many ways. Despite the creativity of It I do think King got some things wrong. The book is about 300 pages too long and I feel that when it came time to explain It and Its origins King became confused by his own creation and the explanation borders on the ludicrous. There are also a lot of unnecessary elements and scenes in the story that don't further the story and simply don't make sense particularly Kings repeated sexualizing of young children.

I had a lot of preconceived notions about this book. I thought it was just about a clown terrorizing kids. Its about so much more than that. Its about faith conquering fear.

The narrations from the other characters, however, are much more like Megs so if you worry about the lighter tone, theres still plenty of that dark and mysterious vibe from the others.

29153,368,3692,"Lately I've been binge watching Grey's Anatomy on Netflix so when I heard that Queen of Hearts was a medical drama with main characters which aren't unlike Meredith and her group of medical misfits, I knew I wanted to read this book.

The story is set in North Carolina and focuses on the long friendship of Zadie and Emma - their home lives, work lives and their close bond. These BFFs are joined by friendship as well as a big secret, a handsome doctor and medical mayhem.

While the book is a medical drama filled with secrets and lies, little bouts of humour are interspersed to lighten things up. I particularly loved Zadie's young daughter who is filled with quirk, sass and a great vocabulary. Martin's writing is impressive for a debut and her experience as an emergency room doctor comes into play as traumas are vividly described. I loved this part and, with my extensive ""Grey's training"", I didn't find it hard to understand what was happening.

The story is told in the alternating voices of Zadie and Emma, past and present, but this switching back and forth wasn't as smooth as I had hoped. Their 'voices' were so similar that I found it difficult to remember who was speaking and would have to backtrack to check. And, if I'm being honest, I didn't find the big secret all that big.

This is a medical drama with a side of secrets. The cover is stunning and it's a fun read but with some stronger characterization (and a less obvious twist) I would have given it a higher rating.

29155,804,1046,"Sell Me in a Sentence: A timely parable about how far social media integration into our lives could and should go, The Circle is worth picking up for its world-building alone.

Summary: Recent college graduate, Mae Holland, lands a job at a prestigious tech company, The Circle. As Mae slowly integrates more into the work culture at the company, she begins to find that both the public and private parts of her life become exposed for public consumption.

Review: The two things I really loved about The Circle were its readability and setting. Dave Eggers is an author Ive decided Ill definitely read again because of his straight forward but humorous prose. Not only did I find myself smiling occasionally because of the references he included in his writing, but I also felt that he had a way of really cutting to the emotion and tone of some scenes without getting too verbose.

A lot of people have critiqued Eggers characterization and plotting. Our MC is not super dynamic, but I don't think I had as much of a problem with that because her inability to see beyond herself and her bubble only gets more noticeable the closer she gets to completing The Circle. For example, I think of Mae as symbolizing organizations that become blind to social inequities as certain legislation and rules start to benefit them. They wanted to solve a problem, they wanted to stand out, they wanted to benefit society - but in the end, theyll observe the status quo for their financial gain. Power is one hell of a drug.

The company and its culture are fascinating to me because Ive always read about startups and large, Silicon Valley corps. Eggers alludes to all your favorite, major tech companies notorious work styles (free food from world renowned chefs - Google, anyone??) throughout the book, while also introducing some cultish practices that would be unsurprising to see in the Valley. He stretches the little world of the company even farther by expanding the its reach to other industries, cities, etc Reading about the tactics the executives at the company used to get rid of red tape was horrifyingly alluring. I only want to read more books about Silicon Valley upon completion.

Overall, I hope that if the general premise of The Circle interests you at all, youll give it a try. Although there are many other books that focus on the pervasive nature of the Internet,I would recommend this one to you because of its tone and foresight.",1520640000,4,sell sentenc time parabl far social medium integr live could go circl worth pick worldbuild alon summari recent colleg graduat mae holland land job prestigi tech compani circl mae slowli integr work cultur compani begin find public privat part life becom expo public consumpt review two thing realli love circl readabl set dave egger author ive decid ill definit read straight forward humor prose find smile occasion refer includ write also felt way realli cut emot tone scene without get verbos lot peopl critiqu egger character plot mc super dynam dont think much problem inabl see beyond bubbl get notic closer get complet circl exampl think mae symbol organ becom blind social inequ certain legisl rule start benefit want solv problem want stand want benefit societi end theyll observ statu quo financi gain power one hell drug compani cultur fascin ive alway read startup larg silicon valley corp egger allud favorit major tech compani notori work style free food world
29156,1769,3201,"Franny made a goal for herself. She would make it as an actress in three years or she would leave New York. She has determined that unlike everybody else, she would really stick to it. She would let her dream go if she hadn't fulfilled it in the three-year time span. Struggling with many different disappointments and fears, she struggles through and keeps trying learning as she goes.

As a huge fan of Lauren Graham, I am now questioning my fangirl status. There are many things I didn't know about Graham. I won't get into them all here as this is a review for this book. She is an amazing author. I really enjoyed this book. I listened to the audiobook just so I can hear Graham's amazing voice. I hope to see many more books out by her and I hope to see many more movies and television shows as well.

The story was pretty amazing. I do have to be completely honest though, it's not as amazing as I thought it would be. There were some parts that fell a bit flat. There were also parts that I feel got more brushed over than they should have been. But it was still a good book and I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed the message behind it.

The characters were easy to connect to. I felt a lot of compassion for Franny especially. She had AMAZING talent and everybody just adored her. She couldn't see it though. She just saw herself as a normal girl living life like everybody else. I could see her keeping that mentality even after she became famous. I really was hoping to see that she got with a certain someone. I'll leave it at that.

Despite the few flaws I found, I still give this book a full five-star rating. It was beautiful. It definitely caught some of my emotions for sure. I love the lessons that were laced through the whole story. Lauren Graham is an amazing actress. It's nice to see that she's an amazing writer as well.

29158,900,2787,"The Narrows brings together several of Michael Connelly's characters, including L.A. detective Harry bosch, Connelly's main protagonist; F.B.I. agent Rachel Walling from The Poet; and Terry McCaleb, a former F.B.I. profiler, who first appeared in Blood Work.

Actually, as this book opens, McCaleb has just died. He was the survivor of a heart transplant and apparently died when his new heart failed him while he was out at sea on the charter fishing boat that he operated. It all seems pretty straightforward, but McCaleb's widow, Graciela, asks Bosch to look into it. Bosch, who has left the L.A.P.D. and is now a private investigator, agrees to do so because McCaleb once saved his life when the two were working together on an earlier case.

McCaleb had never been able to let go of his career as a profiler, and although he was no longer with the F.B.I., he occasionally consulted with other law enforcement agencies. He also followed cases that he personally found interesting and left several boxes of files when he died. Bosch begins reviewing the files and finds a relatively new case that had grabbed McCaleb's attention. The case had caused McCaleb to travel to a desolate part of Nevada, but his notes are fairly cryptic, and Bosch can't figure out what McCaleb might have been looking for there.

Virtually at the same time, an unidentified person sends a GPS unit to the F.B.I. addressed to Rachel Walling. Walling has been exiled to hardship duty in North and South Dakota because she fell out of favor with the Powers That Be at the end of the case where she was chasing the Poet. The Poet was presumed to be dead at the end of that book, but it was impossible to confirm the identification of the body that was found, and anyone who's ever read a novel about a serial killer knows what that means.

The Fibbies have no choice but to bring Rachel back into the fold, at least until they can figure out why the GPS was sent to her, and as it turns out, the coordinates on the GPS send them to the exact same desolate spot in the Nevada desert where Bosch is headed. Oops!

It quickly becomes apparent that a very bad hombre is on the loose and, naturally, the stuffed shirts at the F.B.I. will have their heads in a position where it will be very difficult for them to think clearly. This means that it will be up to Harry and Rachel to save civilization as we know it, if only it's not too late.

This is a very entertaining novel and it's great fun watching Bosch and Walling work together, especially with all the odds that are stacked against them.

29163,255,2797,"FINAL DECISION: A comfortable read about a man who changes his life after the death of his father leaves him and his brothers with the responsibility for a ten year old and begins a relationship with a social worker. The story builds towards the end and offers a springboard for the series.

THE STORY: Cameron Quinn has sailed around the world racing boats and wooing women. The death of his father brings him home where he and his two brothers face decisions on what to do with the ten year old boy that their father brought into their family. The three men have to find a way of building a family in order to keep guardianship of the young boy which challenges all of the lives they have built. They also have to satisfy the watchful eyes of Anna Spinelli, a social worker, who has her doubts that the three men can build a home for a wary and damaged child.

OPINION: This book's romance suffers a little from the introduction books. The situation and the characters all have to be set out which means that Anna and Cam get less ""screen time"". Their romance was only okay for me until the last quarter of the book where things pick up and end on a high emotional note.

I enjoyed this book primarily because of the Quinn family dynamics. There is something really special in how these three men and a young boy figure make a family. The story is both inspirational and sweet. And I love watching these strong men give up whatever they have to for the love of family.

Anna and Cam are both damaged people who have triumphed through the love of others. Unfortunately, we don't get much into their heads in this book. So while I really enjoy the story of this book, I wish the romance had been stronger.

At the same time, the comfortable nature of this story makes it one that I've read before and would read again on a rainy day.

WORTH MENTIONING: This book clearly is part of a series so ongoing story lines are not finished but the romance is complete here.

~ Prayer to The Queen Bee

Awhile back, my book club read a book entitled The Bees by Laline Paul. Ive heard of The Bees given that theres been plenty of of buzz about this book as of late (See what I did there? Buzz! Buzz!) but it wasn't on my TBR list. Now one of the reasons I belong to my book club (other than getting out of the house) is that so I read books that I normally wouldnt pick up  to make me step outside of my comfort zone. The Bees definitely did that.

--What I Didnt Expect--

First off, The Bees is a fiction book  it is not a study about the life of bees, though the reader does learn plenty about the life of bees and the hive hierarchy.

The book opens with people talking about a beehive in the back yard. Then, the book completely switches gears. The rest of the story is told from the point of view of an overly large  and exceptionally talented  sanitation worker bee named Flora 717. I waited, expecting that the point of view would switch back to the humans. It did not until the final closing scene of the book. As I began reading, a realization struck me: This book is not going to be about humans. There aren't going to be any humans in this storyline at all. Its going to be about bees, told from the point of view of a bee.

--How Interesting Is The Life of a Bee?--

I will say that initially, I was skeptical. I mean, how interesting could the life a worker bee be? Buzz Buzz. Youd be surprised! And I was  surprised and pleased that instead of a boring read about bee, I found an original, rich, engrossing book  and even an enjoyable book  in The Bees.

--So Whats It Really About?--

The novel investigates the life of a beehive and in so doing, unravels the following themes: politics, religion, freedom, independence, fanaticism, conformity, power, environmental influences, big government, defying authority, police brutality and more. Theres even an attempted coup at the end. Sounds riveting, no? It was!

--Accept, Obey, Serve--

Above all else, there were three rules to live by in the hive mind: Accept, Obey, Serve and we hear this mantra repeated over and over until it becomes deeply ingrained in each bees psyche. This kind of made me think of a dystopian society ruled by one ruler for they often use such matras to control their followers (subjects). The Capital in the Hunger Games comes to mind.

There was also another rule, one that must never be broken under the penalty of immediate death: Only the Queen may lay. Guess which rule gets broken?

--Verdict--

If you don't particularly care for books that anthropomorphize critters, then this book may not be for you. However, if you enjoy dystopian books or think you might enjoy a read about the inner workings and drama of a beehive told from the point of view of a special, headstrong, independent bee, then its definitely worth a read. From what I know about bees, its obvious that the author definitely did her homework in portraying the intricacies of hive life.

I enjoyed this fascinating, well-written characterization of honey bees and am glad I read it. I found it innovative, intriguing, suspenseful, original and at times, humorous and page-turning. Who knew that a novel about the life cycle of bees could be so interesting? And who knew that I would enjoy reading such a book? I know that Ill never look at a bee in quite the same way. I would have loved to have seen a map of the hive as an attachment to the book. I must say that now, Im a bit intrigued.

I give it five buzzing stars out of five!

The young boy, now a young man, has escaped the elusive Sandman and tells a terrifying tale of terror and suffering beyond all comprehension.

29169,3595,506,"2018 marks the 200th anniversary of the publication of Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS. While I did not read - or in this case listen to - the novel because of the anniversary, it does seem appropriate that I picked this time to read what is generally considered the first true science fiction novel. I would imagine that most people, myself included, first encountered FRANKENSTEIN as the 1931 movie of the same name, which is somewhat based on the novel. As we know, the movie recounts the story of a scientist who, along with his assistant, piece together a human-like creature from the pieces of dug up corpses. Most infamously, Henry Frankenstein's assistant Fritz acquires the brain of a criminal for the Creature (played by Boris Karloff), thus lending the story the conflict it needs when the Creature comes alive and begins wreaking havoc throughout the local countryside. There have been many movie and literary adaptations and spinoffs of the original FRANKENSTEIN. I am particularly fond, of course, of Mel Brooks' movie Young Frankenstein, in which Peter Boyle portrays the Creature. I'm also fond of Michael Bishop's 1994 novel BRITTLE INNINGS, which links the FRANKENSTEIN story and baseball.

It probably would surprise no one who has only seen the movie that it bears only a small resemblance to Shelley's novel.

Shelley's novel is told as a framing narrative. The story starts out recounting the correspondence between Robert Walton and his sister Margaret. Walton is traveling to the North Pole to gain scientific knowledge. While on the journey, he and his crew first spot a dog sled driven by a large man, then rescue a man who is near death. The man is Victor Frankenstein, who has been pursuing the man in the dog sled. As Walton nurses Frankenstein back to health, they become friends. Walton shares his story of intense desire for scientific knowledge. Frankenstein, seeing much of himself in Walton, recounts the story of how he arrived on Walton's boat and why Walton should think twice about his intense thirst for knowledge.

The framing narrative becomes layered as Frankenstein first recounts his story of becoming obsessed with scientific knowledge, and especially that of how to bring life to an inanimate being. He almost quite literally becomes the ""mad scientist"", spending all his time researching the subject and then, once he discovers the actual process to bring a creature to life, doing nothing but what it takes to make it happen. He rarely eats and sleeps, and his relationship with his family deteriorates to almost nothing. He does finally bring the Creature to life, but once he sees it he is appalled and disgusted with what he has done, and he aims to destroy it.

Next comes the Creature's story as told by the Creature itself, which takes up the bulk of the novel. Unlike Karloff's portrayal of the Creature, the novel shows the Creature learning about himself, learning about language - to the point where he becomes erudite to the point of sounding as if he had what we might call a college education - and learning how and why he is shunned by the rest of humanity. He then realizes that he is what he is because of Frankenstein (resulting in what would be a fascinating study of the nature versus nurture - or in this case, lack of nurture - discussion) and vows to deprive Victor of happiness much like Victor has deprived him of happiness. Eventually the narrative returns to Frankenstein's story and eventually Walton's, culminating with Walton meeting the Creature itself.

It was somewhat surprising to me how short the novel actually is. As readers we have been trained to expect complex stories like this to be at least double the length. And while there is much detail that could be discussed - and I refuse to be concerned about spoiling a story that is over 200 years old at this point - I will stop here and let those who have yet to read the novel go ahead and do so without giving it all away.

I was pleasantly surprised by FRANKENSTEIN. I guess I've been conditioned by the movie, which I've seen several times, to expect one thing while the novel turned out to be entirely something else. While the name Frankenstein usually is used to refer to the Creature, it's pretty clear that the real villain of the novel is Victor himself. His hubris in creating life from where there is none - and at the time FRANKENSTEIN was written the implication was that Victor was stepping where only God was meant to tread - resulted in a Creature who quite understandably was ticked off at his situation and who also quite understandably blamed the only person he knew to be responsible for his plight. The Creature was shown to be a compassionate being, and one who gave Frankenstein every opportunity to shut down the violence and death that was occurring around him. Yet,
Victor chose to let it continue, and indeed brought so much suffering upon himself by his actions the reader might be tempted to believe that he is the Wretch (as the Creature is sometimes called) and not the Creature itself.

Jim Donaldson provided an adequate narration of the novel. As I listened to the book, I felt that his voice and tone were perfect for the gothic nature of the story. His gravelly-voiced rendition of the Creature could not have been easy for him to do; at the same time, I was taken out of the story by his portrayal of the Creature. He sounded like a crotchety old man, which does not fit with my image of the Creature. That could be due to me being influenced by Karloff's rendition of the Creature, although his gutteral roars do sound like an old man too, I suppose.

If you've never read the book, I suggest you do so. It's interesting to contrast the novel and the movie, and of course that's something we do with today's movies anyway - from Lord of the Rings to Hunger Games to anything else. I can see why this is considered a classic, and it's well worth the time for you to read it for yourself and, hopefully, come to the same conclusion.",1520640000,4,2018 mark 200th anniversari public mari shelley frankenstein modern prometheu read case listen novel anniversari seem appropri pick time read gener consid first true scienc fiction novel would imagin peopl includ first encount frankenstein 1931 movi name somewhat base novel know movi recount stori scientist along assist piec togeth humanlik creatur piec dug corp infam henri frankenstein assist fritz acquir brain crimin creatur play bori karloff thu lend stori conflict need creatur come aliv begin wreak havoc throughout local countrysid mani movi literari adapt spinoff origin frankenstein particularli fond cours mel brook movi young frankenstein peter boyl portray creatur im also fond michael bishop 1994 novel brittl inning link frankenstein stori basebal probabl would surpris one seen movi bear small resembl shelley novel shelley novel told frame narr stori start recount correspond robert walton sister margaret walton travel north pole gain scientif knowledg journey crew first spot dog sled driven larg man rescu man near death man victor frankenstein pursu man dog sled walton nurs frankenstein back

29172,1984,2973,"I read this book in the past, but so long ago that I don't remember when. I read this series in order along the way after someone (I no longer remember who) recommended it. With the recent passing of Sue Grafton, when I saw this book at a book exchange, I decided to reread it. And I found that I didn't remember the particulars of the plot (though I do remember overarching facts of the series).

Kinsey Millhone is rehabbing an arm hurt in ""B is for Burglar"" and meets Bobby Callahan at the fitness center. Bobby hires her to find out who tried and/or is trying to kill him. Kinsey is hampered by the fact that Bobby's accident created memory loss.

There is a subplot with Kinsey's landlord Henry meeting a woman whom everyone else seems to dislike.

I liked Bobby as a character and was sad when he died. He had a lot of heart and determination and was facing long odds to have even a fairly normal life but he kept working at it day after day--trying to improve the things he could. I hope that in the end his example inspired his stepsister Kitty.

I did notice the similarity of plot between ""B is for Burglar"" and this book--in both Kinsey gets hired and then keeps working the case after the initial client is no longer in the picture. I did wonder if Bobby remembering the name Blackman was perhaps his brain remembering the idea of blackmail (though no one in the book seemed to wonder that).

I liked that Kinsey tried to look out for her landlord, an octogenarian who is usually more on the ball than he seemed in this book. However, her action comes almost too late. Henry's already given the lady twenty thousand dollars! Luckily, Kinsey manages to recover this money for Henry as well as keeping it out of the knowledge of the police. I'm not sure I agree with that action overall since it is hiding evidence, but I do appreciate her wanting to protect Henry from a potentially embarrassing situation of lots of people knowing he'd been duped.",1520640000,4,read book past long ago dont rememb read seri order along way someon longer rememb recommend recent pas sue grafton saw book book exchang decid reread found didnt rememb particular plot though rememb overarch fact seri kinsey millhon rehab arm hurt b burglar meet bobbi callahan fit center bobbi hire find tri andor tri kill kinsey hamper fact bobbi accid creat memori loss subplot kinsey landlord henri meet woman everyon el seem dislik like bobbi charact sad die lot heart determin face long odd even fairli normal life kept work day daytri improv thing could hope end exampl inspir stepsist kitti notic similar plot b burglar bookin kinsey get hire keep work case initi client longer pictur wonder bobbi rememb name blackman perhap brain rememb idea blackmail though one book seem wonder like kinsey tri look landlord octogenarian usual ball seem book howev action come almost late henri alreadi given ladi twenti
29173,1333,3856,"This may well be the best book I have read on Christian parenting. It answers so many questions and is full of biblical and practical instruction.

We live our lives intentionally, planning and making lists. Yet we think we can raise godly children without doing so intentionally. Shepherding a child to a godly adulthood does not just automatically happen. The Comer's provide the theological basis for intentional parenting as well as suggestions for developing a parenting plan that is effective and doable.

I am impressed with the biblical foundation they lay. For example, they reference Luke 2:52 and outline the three areas to intentionally focus on: character development, relationship building, and spiritual training. The tools they employ are also based on a biblical basis, such as 2 Timothy 4:2.

The Comers walk readers through the growth stages, giving practical suggestions along the way. They have insights into guiding the strong willed child. They advocate really knowing each child and how that shapes parenting techniques. They clarify the difference between punishment and discipline. They help readers to know what to do if they've parented in a wrong way so far. And perhaps my favorite emphasis is that parents must themselves be passionate followers of Jesus and model that behavior.

The Comers share how they formed their own vision of raising disciples for generations. That vision shaped their parenting goals and even determined which television programs they watched. Knowing that one plan does not work for all families, they help readers develop their own parenting visions and plans.

I highly recommend this book to parents and potential parents. You will find within its covers a wealth of information and practical help in raising godly adults.

29176,1339,3840,"Patricia Briggs returns to the Alpha & Omega world with BURN BRIGHT. If you have not read the previous Mercy Thompson book, I would suggest that you do. Although they are different series, youll get some mention of events that I think are important to know between these two series.

BURN BRIGHT is much more mellow than the fast-pace of the Mercy Thompson series. Written in third person, it also gives readers a much more broader view of the world. I really enjoy this because we get a lot more POVs with this series than in the Mercy one, which allows for us to get some answers and/or clues for whats going to happen next.

I will say that the very beginning of the book was a little slow, but once Charles and Anna are on the scene, thats when things start to pick up. If you're a fan of Mystery, I think youll also enjoy this series. There are a ton of unsolved mysteries in this series and its always a pleasure to see how they all pan out.

While most of the major cast is present, a few favorites may not be. Briggs gives a lot of insight into a lot of different people, creating a well-rounded narrative that feels all inclusive.

29187,4906,63,"In a world where women are the dominant gender, what could go wrong? When those women possess a special flame in them with the power to kill, a lot could go wrong.

When the world discovers that young girls have an electric current running inside their bodies, the patriarchy flips upside down. This power enables females to not only cause damage, but to kill those who cross them. Some embrace the power; others hide from it. We follow the journey of Allie, who turns to religion to gain more power and is revered as the goddess Mother Eve. Then theres Margot, turning to politics to rise from mayor to governor and help girls learn to use and control their power. Fierce Roxy, on the other hand, uses her power for vengeance. Our only male perspective is Tunde, a Nigerian journalist who places himself right in the powers action to document for the rest of the world.

While I loved the premise of the novel, I felt that Alderman did not explore it as deeply as it could have been explored. There seems to be a lot more she could have done here; she does touch upon the religious, political, and social effects of the power, but only skims across the surface of these effects. The varying perspectives of the novel seemed promising at first, but could be a bit confusing at times and were unevenly dispersed. I did enjoy the letters featured in the beginning and end, and thought it very creative how Alderman incorporated herself into the story through these letters.

29196,150,630,"The Last Mrs. Parrish quickly draws you in and moves you along into a ever-tightening web of suspense. It certainly elicits many emotions - ranging from envy to intrigue to amazement to shock to amusement.
The only call out Id make that after reading The Wife Between Us,  - this is a very similar story line: rich man, beautiful girl, intrigue, deception, etc. However The Last Mrs. Parrish is better executed in my opinion.

Amber Patterson is tired of being an invisible woman who blends into the background. She deserves a life of money and power like the blond-haired, blue-eyed Daphne Parrish takes for granted. In the exclusive town of Bishops Harbor, Connecticut, Daphne who is a socialite and her real-estate developer husband - Jackson, are perceived to be the perfect couple.

The first half ofThe Last Mrs. Parrishis told from Ambers perspective, and while we know that she is manipulative and has a big plan, one that will take her to the new life she wants, there are also hints of a life of secrets she left behind.

When it looks like she is right where she wants to be, things turn around and we see life from the perspective of Daphne... who is not quite the happy woman she appears, in fact her secrets and what she has done to keep them hidden make everything about this story the page turner it is.

The Last Mrs. Parrish is actually confusing at times, as it jumps around a great deal it still works well as a psychological read. The characterisations are strong yet there is just enough mystery and intrigue to keep you wondering...

29197,7,382,"Let me start by saying that I know my opinion on this book is different from that of almost everyone else. I had high hopes for this, after reading The Coldest Girl In Coldtown and really enjoying it, but this book did not work for me. The story itself is not bad, but getting to the story through all of the repetitive quotes from characters that pop up every few chapters, sifting past the pages and pages of details about the types of clothing that the characters are wearing, and the frustrating and often times hard to understand relationships between characters, made this book extremely hard to get through.

The relationships between the main character, her sister, and their ""family"" is possibly one of the most unbelievable and hard to understand. It makes the characters seem extremely naive and trusting, though they have every reason in the world not to be. It was also vey strange how the story swaps between regal and formal dialogue to modern day slang and situations. This is a book that has royal magical creatures, but also parts of the book dedicated to human shopping malls and shopping at Target. It didn't mesh well together and I get the feeling that including the modern references will only serve to date this book.

I can't personally recommend this book. It was too hard to get through and I feel it could have been told in a single book, but I have discovered that it is going to be at least a three book series. Perhaps some of Holly Black's future works will read better for me, but I won't be getting the next two books because after this one I don't really care how the story ends.",1520726400,2,let start say know opinion book differ almost everyon el high hope read coldest girl coldtown realli enjoy book work stori bad get stori repetit quot charact pop everi chapter sift past page page detail type cloth charact wear frustrat often time hard understand relationship charact made book extrem hard get relationship main charact sister famili possibl one unbeliev hard understand make charact seem extrem naiv trust though everi reason world also vey strang stori swap regal formal dialogu modern day slang situat book royal magic creatur also part book dedic human shop mall shop target didnt mesh well togeth get feel includ modern refer serv date book cant person recommend book hard get feel could told singl book discov go least three book seri perhap holli black futur work read better wont get next two book one dont realli care stori end

29199,813,511,"A Piece of the World by Christina Baker Kline is a novel which tells the story behind one of Andrew Wyeths iconic painting Christinas World. Ms. Baker is a prolific writer with several best sellers.

Christina Olson lives in a small coastal town called Cushing, Maine. Christinas home is an old farm which has been in her mothers family for generations.

Christina has an unknown disease which increasingly degenerates her muscles, but she fights against it with every fiber of her being. For more than 20 years, the Olson farm has been the subject of artist Andrew Wyeth, a family friend.

I am familiar with the painting Christinas World by Andrew Wyeth, but cant say I have given it much thought. When I heard about A Piece of the World by Christina Baker Kline , I thought it would be a subject Id be interested in, and anyway I enjoyed the book Orphan Train which the author wrote.

This is the story of Christina Olson, not Andrew Wyeth. The artist is a minor character in this story and the famous painting is a culmination of Christinas life and the artists understanding of how she views the world.

This is a charming book, it brings forth the difficult life of an intelligent, but handicapped girl, then a woman, in the 1920s and throughout her life. Combine that with the difficult life of living and working on a farm, a back-breaking work for even the healthiest of people and one sees the painting in a whole new light.

At the end of the book the author wrote a bit of history about the real Christina Olson, and how she differs from the fictional character she created.

29203,557,3499,"When twenty-three year old Mikael Kohler-Frost, dazed, feverish, and painfully thin, escapes from a captor who held him prisoner for thirteen years, the authorities are stunned.  How did this young man get away when so many others, including his sister Felicia, disappeared, never to be seen again?  The answer can be found in the mind of a demented but crafty villain, Jurek Walter (""he has committed the most heinous crimes of any serial killer in Swedish history), who is confined in a secure psychiatric facility in Lwenstrmska hospital.  He is considered to be so dangerous that he is not permitted to receive visitors or correspond by mail with anyone. One of his most frightening characteristics is his uncanny ability to brainwash anyone foolish enough to listen to his hypnotic voice.

Hoping to find Mikael's sister before it is too late, Detective Inspector Joona Linna and his colleagues decide to send the stunningly beautiful, strong, but emotionally fragile Inspector Saga Bauer undercover. She will pose as a tormented and dangerous mental patient; her superiors hope that Walter will be intrigued enough by Saga to reveal some of his secrets.  ""The Sandman,"" by Lars Kepler (the pseudonym of married couple Alexandra Coelho Ahndoril and Alenxander Ahndoril), translated by Neil Smith, is a tale of sadism, revenge, and unspeakable cruelty.  As long as Walter is alive, no one whom he targets is safe from psychological and physical torment.

Jurek Walter may be a sociopath, but he is also insightful and intelligent.  He knows all too well that when a family's loved ones are suddenly snatched away, those left behind will probably never be whole again. Kepler writes extremely short chapters (this gets a bit irritating) and frequently moves back and forth in time.  The authors also alternate points of view, allowing us to observe plot developments through the eyes of various individuals, including the victims, police officers, and psychiatrists.  As the body count rises, the detectives fear that they may have underestimated their adversary.  This is a graphically violent novel about a superhuman mastermind  at war with law enforcement professionals who, unfortunately, lag behind in their efforts to outwit him.  By the time Joona Linna understands Walter's motive and methods, it may be too late to undo all of the damage that this fiend has inflicted on his victims. Scandinavian thrillers are frequently dark and depressing, but when it comes to brutality and gore, ""The Sandman"" is in a category of its own.  This book will appeal to fans of complex, unsettling, and dark works of fiction.",1520726400,4,twentythre year old mikael kohlerfrost daze feverish pain thin escap captor held prison thirteen year author stun young man get away mani other includ sister felicia disappear never seen answer found mind dement crafti villain jurek walter commit heinou crime serial killer swedish histori confin secur psychiatr facil lwenstrmska hospit consid danger permit receiv visitor correspond mail anyon one frighten characterist uncanni abil brainwash anyon foolish enough listen hypnot voic hope find mikael sister late detect inspector joona linna colleagu decid send stunningli beauti strong emot fragil inspector saga bauer undercov pose torment danger mental patient superior hope walter intrigu enough saga reveal secret sandman lar kepler pseudonym marri coupl alexandra coelho ahndoril alenxand ahndoril translat neil smith tale sadism reveng unspeak cruelti long walter aliv one target safe psycholog physic torment jurek walter may sociopath also insight intellig know well famili love one suddenli snatch away left behind probabl never whole kepler write extrem short chapter get bit irrit frequent move back forth time author also altern point view allow u

29215,76,516,"Serendipity Jones, y'all.

My goodness, I loved this girl.

Full disclosure?  Gunslinger Girl was preordered about two days before release, and it's been sitting on my shelf every since.  I've been eyeing it with doubt and suspicion for two months until I picked it up last week thinking ""might as well get this over with"".

I am a fool.

I wish I had read this book two months ago.  Heavens, I wish I had received an ARC.  Pity and Max and Luster and the whole gang were exactly what I needed right now in my unenthusiastic reading drudge.  I mean, for starters - PITY.  Serendipity Jones is such a fantastic character.  She's Calamity Jane, she's Annie Oakley, and she's something fierce and powerful and entirely her own.  She's a straight shot with a six shooter and yet she's also a lost kitten.  You love her and you cheer for her and you ache for her.

Gunslinger Girl is one of those books where you know you're only just skimming the surface.  While we hear a good deal of Pity's story and even some of Max's - we know that there a whole lot  more world out there and everyone at Casimir has a deep, troubling past.  I want to know them all, in excruciating detail.  Moreover, this book is just ripe for a sequel and I'm hoping that's on the horizon in some SUPER SECRET vault somewhere.  It'll be called ""Bounty Hunter"" and it will be amazing.  Also, guys?  Just let me dream.  I have no idea if Lyndsay is planning a sequel but if she is, I will preorder it faster than Pity can shoot a tin can off a fence at fifty paces.

This book was refreshing and rich and fun and built up in this totally stunning world and from the moment I fell in love (page 24) I have been recommending this to everyone.  Ev-er-y-one.

So if you haven't read Gunslinger Girl yet and you're crazy about rich dystopias, performances a la The Greatest Showman, women who don't need rescuing, and government plots - good god y'all, what're you waiting for?",1520726400,5,serendip jone yall good love girl full disclosur gunsling girl preorder two day releas sit shelf everi sinc ive eye doubt suspicion two month pick last week think might well get fool wish read book two month ago heaven wish receiv arc piti max luster whole gang exactli need right unenthusiast read drudg mean starter piti serendip jone fantast charact she calam jane she anni oakley she someth fierc power entir she straight shot six shooter yet she also lost kitten love cheer ach gunsling girl one book know your skim surfac hear good deal piti stori even max know whole lot world everyon casimir deep troubl past want know excruci detail moreov book ripe sequel im hope that horizon super secret vault somewher itll call bounti hunter amaz also guy let dream idea lyndsay plan sequel preorder faster piti shoot tin fenc fifti pace book refresh rich fun built total stun world

29217,94,2464,"Dr. Clarissa Pinkola Estes stresses that most women in part or wholly have had their natural feminine instincts weakened or totally stifled with the result that they suffer in many ways. She asserts, correctly in my view, that women need to awaken from the mistreatment and be all that they can be, live a life that is natural and healthy, one that fits a womans fundamental nature. This will be better for the women and for men. She speaks often with metaphors, thereby adding to the strength of her assertions. For example, she calls the woman who acts according to her instincts a wild woman, even though this is an overstatement. She analysis women, the harm inflicted upon them, and the ways that the women can overcome the problem, by examining nineteen tales, mostly multicultural fairy tales. Much of the analysis is based on the psychology of Carl Jung, but people who know nothing about this psychologist and even those who know his sordid history, will enjoy Estes very clever and fascinating incisive evaluations of the tales.
In the story of Bluebeard, for example, Bluebeard convinces a young girl to marry him. She is nave and convinced that he will act in the future as he is acting now when he is courting her. His beard isn't really that blue. He tells he that he must go away for a short while and he leaves her responsible for the keys to the estate. She may have free reign of the house, but may not enter one room. Temptation gets the best of her, and she looks inside; there she finds the bodies of his former wives. The key begins to bleed and she is covered in blood. When he returns, he sees the bloody key and knows what she has done. He tells her he must kill her as he killed his other wives. She begs for time so that she may say her prayers, and he agrees. During this time, her brother comes and kills him.
Estes examines the many details of the tale. The details reveal that most women are nave about predators, and they choose someone who is destructive to their lives. Bluebeards killing of his curious wives is the killing of the creative feminine. Not understanding this and not seeing or feeling what their husbands are doing, the wives are determined to cure that person with love.
Estes goes into detail teaching that women must listen to their intuition, their inner voice, ask questions, be curious, see what you see, hear what you hear, and then act upon what you know to be true.",1520726400,5,dr clarissa pinkola est stress woman part wholli natur feminin instinct weaken total stifl result suffer mani way assert correctli view woman need awaken mistreat live life natur healthi one fit woman fundament natur better woman men speak often metaphor therebi ad strength assert exampl call woman act accord instinct wild woman even though overstat analysi woman harm inflict upon way woman overcom problem examin nineteen tale mostli multicultur fairi tale much analysi base psycholog carl jung peopl know noth psychologist even know sordid histori enjoy est clever fascin incis evalu tale stori bluebeard exampl bluebeard convinc young girl marri nave convinc act futur act court beard isnt realli blue tell must go away short leav respons key estat may free reign hous may enter one room temptat get best look insid find bodi former wive key begin bleed cover blood return see bloodi key know

29230,4906,112,"Who doesnt love a whodunit? My first Agatha Christie, and its clear why shes dubbed the Queen of Mystery as she takes a spin on the classic whodunit narrative.

We follow the legendary detective Hercule Poirot as he returns to London on the Orient Express. A detective on a train? Surely, there will be a mystery for him to solve. That mystery comes on the second night of his journey, when the trains malevolent passenger Ratchett is stabbed and killed in his sleep. With the train stopped by a snowdrift and no signs of moving, we embark on Poirots investigation into the eccentric cast of passengers aboard the Orient Express. No obvious connections to Ratchett, no clear motives, no discovered murder weapon; will this be the case that Poirot cannot solve? Or is everything not how it seems?

Christie sets her novel up logically into three parts: The Facts, The Evidence, and Hercule Poirot Sits Back and Thinks. I enjoyed how the reader becomes a part of Poirots investigation, and that we are able to uncover clues along with the detective. However, despite this clear layout, readers are kept guessing until the very end and are given an answer that is rewarding and simply just makes sense. At times, I found myself a bit confused in keeping track of all the trains passengers and following who was who.

29232,2403,149,"*THERE IS A MINOR SPOILER IN HERE, MOSTLY FOR A TRIGGER WARNING FOR RAPE*

When I read the first book in this series, The Magicians, I gave this series the benefit of the doubt. I thought I was going to like the sequel a lot more because it starts out in Fillory. However, that didn't really matter because it seems like our ""hero"" Quentin has had zero personal growth. It feels like he has learned absolutely nothing from the events of the first novel. It really annoyed me, because I thought maybe he would have been a more interesting character in his novel. Not the case! He's all, ""Oh, woe is me, I get to be a king of Fillory, but I haven't had any adventures!"" STOPPPPP!!!!

*TRIGGER WARNING IN THIS PARAGRAPH*
I was so not here for Quentin and his BS in this sequel. The novel was structured weird because it kept flipping back and forth between the present day and Julia's past. We see at the end of the first novel that Julia ends up with the group as a Queen of Fillory, but we don't know how she learned magic or why she is not ""all together there."" I was interested in Julia's journey, and honestly the book might have been more engaging if it focused on her entirely, and left out Quentin. *The reason that Julia is the way she is, is because she has gone through the truama of sexual assault. I really did not like this, because it felt like there was zero reason why there needed to be a rape scene in this novel about magic. I also feel like it was written off as a joke, there is a line that says, ""This wasn't his first rodeo."" That really pissed me off, and I think it was completely unnecessary to the story. The story tried to explain it by this is how Julia has become something not human, but I call BS I think the author just wanted to get away with a rape scene in a book that 100% DID NOT NEED IT.

I also really found myself annoyed with the audiobook narrator in this one. I don't think it irritated me as much in the first book, but in this one it really started to grate on me. He pronounces the word ""white"" so weird, and since in Fillory they live in Castle Whitespire, I had to hear it all the time. He also pronounced the Egyptian god Anubis super weird! Is it just me? I just couldn't stand him, and I don't think I can stomach another audiobook done by this narrator.

I felt like this book was just entirely too long. It just also became apparent just how derivate of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia this story really is. I'm really put off by this novel, and I don't think I'm going to be continuing with this series. I think there is only one more book in the series, but I can't stand another book about whinny Quentin Coldwater.",1520726400,1,minor spoiler mostli trigger warn rape read first book seri magician gave seri benefit doubt thought go like sequel lot start fillori howev didnt realli matter seem like hero quentin zero person growth feel like learn absolut noth event first novel realli annoy thought mayb would interest charact novel case he oh woe get king fillori havent adventur stoppppp trigger warn paragraph quentin b sequel novel structur weird kept flip back forth present day julia past see end first novel julia end group queen fillori dont know learn magic togeth interest julia journey honestli book might engag focus entir left quentin reason julia way gone truama sexual assault realli like felt like zero reason need rape scene novel magic also feel like written joke line say wasnt first rodeo realli piss

I love all the characters, I love the plot, I love the... things that happened!! The writing was beautiful as well, and I love how the author hands out little tidbits of information at a time like puzzle pieces.  I have been put off by YA fantasy/sci-fi lately, because so many of them have been too predictable.  I did not foresee most of the things that happened in Heart of Iron!  I will admit, though, that the editing was a bit rough, especially at the beginning.  There were a lot of repeated words, spelling errors and sentences changing from past to present tense.  This did tend to pull me out of the story a bit, but things started to flow more smoothly the further I got into the story.

If I had to plug Heart of Iron, I'd say it's for fans of The Lunar Chronicles, Throne of Glass and... maybe Firefly. Throw in some LGBTQ characters and some robots and you've got yourself Heart of Iron! While it does have elements of each of these books in it, the overall storyline, especially the ending, is unique and refreshing.  I can't wait for Book 2, and to see what happens next and how this band of misfit outlaws is going to fix everything.  I don't think I've been this excited over a new series since ACOTAR.

29234,1984,3648,"My family visited Oak Ridge, TN on one of our family vacations--probably in the 1970s or 1980s. At first, I thought the book might be more like ""Hidden Figures"", focusing on real people who worked at Oak Ridge and the fact that women were hired there during the war effort since so many men were away fighting, but this is more of a novel (fiction but with some historical facts). The novel focuses on several groups of people: people who came to work at Oak Ridge with little knowledge of what their jobs were working toward; people who came to work at Oak Ridge knowing that they were working toward something big; and support people like construction workers and janitors.

June Walker is a Tennessee country girl who follows her older sister to the area after losing her soldier fiance in the war. Cecelia Roberts is a girl who taught herself to behave like the rich in order to land a well-to-do husband. At the start, neither really knows what the job they are trained to do is about.

Joe Brewer is an African-American man from Alabama, who, along with his friend Ralph, came up from Alabama to take advantage of the better paying construction jobs Oak Ridge could offer. They live in a segregated part of Oak Ridge. Ralph meets Shirley Crawford who encourages him to get involved in efforts to improve the African-American conditions. Joe is more content to let things be. After construction slows, Joe is given a janitorial job and is able to find a position for his wife so that she and his family can move to the area. They are able to live together as a family thanks to the efforts of Shirley and Ralph and others like them.

Dr. Sam Cantor is a physicist brought in to work on the project. He's one of the few who has an idea of what the plant is working toward. He's a very unhappy man at his core. He struggles with his Jewish family in Europe probably being killed because of their beliefs. He struggles with knowing that what he's helping to create will have horrific effects, including possibly killing innocent people. When he meets June, being with her seems to stave off some of his unhappiness and he enjoys being able to teach her about things like physics and science, but the effect doesn't last forever and soon he's back to drinking.

I liked that the epilogue told us what happened to the characters after they left Oak Ridge. I'm glad June found someone to love her (and whom I hope she loved) and that she was able to surprise others with her love of and understanding of science at a time when the scientific world probably wasn't as popular with women. CeCe got what she wanted--she got to be part of high-society--though she didn't fool her mother-in-law one bit with her act. But she may have found that wanting is not the same as having. Ralph sacrificed himself for his beliefs. Joe and Moriah lived out their lives and raised their children. Sam discovered too late that he really had loved June.

It was an interesting look into history and into how secretive the atomic bomb project was at the time. I did think it was odd that after all the secrecy, the President just announced it after the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima--but it was a different time, perhaps a more trusting time. It just seemed odd to go from secrecy to being able to discuss many aspects all in a day's time. It made it doubly odd that June was dismissed for saying the word ""bomb"" and being overheard by others a day or so before it became known to the world.",1520726400,4,famili visit oak ridg tn one famili vacationsprob 1970 1980 first thought book might like hidden figur focus real peopl work oak ridg fact woman hire war effort sinc mani men away fight novel fiction histor fact novel focus sever group peopl peopl came work oak ridg littl knowledg job work toward peopl came work oak ridg know work toward someth big support peopl like construct worker janitor june walker tennesse countri girl follow older sister area lose soldier fianc war cecelia robert girl taught behav like rich order land welltodo husband start neither realli know job train joe brewer africanamerican man alabama along friend ralph came alabama take advantag better pay construct job oak ridg could offer live segreg part oak ridg ralph meet shirley crawford encourag get involv effort improv africanamerican condit joe content let thing construct slow joe given janitori job abl find posit wife famili move area abl live togeth famili thank effort shirley ralph other like dr sam cantor

29236,1279,1498,"Based on the reviews I expected (and wanted) to like this a lot more than I did.  **SOME SPOILERS AHEAD**

This really wasn't anything 'new' as far as plots go.  In fact, I felt at times that I would be better off watching a rerun of ""The Good Wife"", which this novel clearly is mimicking.  Angela and Jason Powell have a rocky marriage at best, made worse by reports of his philandering at work.

The first case is with a young intern and there is no hard evidence and can be brushed aside as 'he said, she said'.  That is until the big bomb drops --- sexual harassment that turned into rape.  Jason has to confess that the woman involved in this separate case he had a brief affair with.  Just when it looks like the NYPD Detectives and Prosecutor have Jason right where they want him --- the woman disappears.

The novel is well written and includes some twists (although one was taken right from a Scott Turow novel).  What I liked best was the use of modern things such as social media which allow cases to be tried on-line and virtually in the court of online opinion well before they make it to any courthouse.  However, the second woman comes up so abruptly on top of the first claim that it was distracting for me.  As the first case is brushed aside in favor of this higher profile one I felt cheated as I wanted to see where the first case might have gone.  If you got my Scott Turow reference then the ending of the novel should be no surprise to you much as it was with me.",1520726400,3,base review expect want like lot spoiler ahead realli wasnt anyth new far plot go fact felt time would better watch rerun good wife novel clearli mimick angela jason powel rocki marriag best made wors report philand work first case young intern hard evid brush asid said said big bomb drop sexual harass turn rape jason confess woman involv separ case brief affair look like nypd detect prosecutor jason right want woman disappear novel well written includ twist although one taken right scott turow novel like best use modern thing social medium allow case tri onlin virtual court onlin opinion well make courthous howev second woman come abruptli top first claim distract first case brush asid favor higher profil one felt cheat want see first case might gone got scott turow refer end novel surpris much

Review Plum Tea Crazy
By
Laura Childs

What it's all about...

Theodosia owns a tea shop in Charleston. Apparently she is the kind of person who loves to get involved in happenings in her town. However for Theodosia most of the things that she gets involved in involve a murder or two. Although this is my first tea shop book I know that these books are incredibly popular. This author has written tons of them! I usually like to read a series in order but this one was easy to get into. The author did an excellent job of introducing these characters as well as their places in this book. Theodosia works daily with Haley...her chef at the shop...and Drayton...her partner and tea expert. In this book Theodosia witnesses a fellow Charlestonian fall to his death and actually get spiked on a fence. She is in this from the very first moment!

Why I wanted to read it...

I am in a cozy mystery kind of mood and this one looked very appealing...tea and scones and murder!

What made me truly enjoy this book...

Theodosia is quite a character! Again...this was my first introduction to her so this book was all about getting to know her and her style. I enjoyed the writing and the characters. I look forward to reading more books in this series!

Why you should read it, too...

Readers who love this kind of cozy mystery should truly enjoy this one...its got everything! Murder, a bit of mayhem and even a girl fight! It was total fun!

I received an advance readers copy of this book from the publisher through NetGalley and Amazon. It was my choice to read it and review it.",1520726400,4,show review plum tea crazi laura child theodosia own tea shop charleston appar kind person love get involv happen town howev theodosia thing get involv involv murder two although first tea shop book know book incred popular author written ton usual like read seri order one easi get author excel job introduc charact well place book theodosia work daili haleyh chef shopand draytonh partner tea expert book theodosia wit fellow charlestonian fall death actual get spike fenc first moment want read cozi mysteri kind mood one look appealingtea scone murder made truli enjoy book theodosia quit charact againthi first introduct book get know style enjoy write charact look forward read book seri read reader love kind cozi mysteri truli enjoy oneit got everyth murder bit mayhem even girl fight total fun receiv advanc reader copi book publish netgalley amazon choic read review

29241,410,1498,"It seems like the ideal marriage. Success, handsome financial genius who vets companies serving the most disadvantaged in the world and who espouses a business philosophy of success through equality. An attractive wife, a once successful caterer out on the Island, who now prefers life at home caring for her husband and their son. Even, yet, an actual house with a yard and garage in Manhattan. What could possibly be more perfect  in fact, the perfect lie?

Angela is married to Jason, who by all accounts seems like the perfect catch: rich and getting richer doing so by ensuring others in business do the good they promise; a man who married her though she had a child, Spencer; a man who married her though she brought something of a painful past to their marriage. Angela is happiest keeping a low profile, done in defense of her past that involved kidnapping, sexual abuse, and worse. So, shes not entirely pleased when Jason, founder of his own company, prof at NYU, author of a New York Times bestselling non-fiction blockbuster, manages to turn the spotlight on himself. Then, one day Jason drops what at first is a firecracker. A young intern, Rachel, at his firm, also a student of his at NYU, accuses him of inappropriate behavior toward him. Jason professes innocence, which turns into, well, maybe I did something and didn't realize it, which morphs into, perhaps I was caught in my underwear by her while dressing in my office. Angela wants badly to believe in him, wants it so badly shes willing to throw up reasons on his behalf while suppressing her doubts.

Then Kerry steps forward to bring charges against Jason for rape. Kerrys a VP at a firm engaged in water projects in underdeveloped countries. Jason defends himself to Angela by claiming that Kerrys company is guilty of nefarious practices, billing for services not rendered, that he was working with her to bring to light, that somehow she has turned on him. In others words, its all just bad business. And still Angela wants to believe, but finds it harder to do so, and finally impossible when a startling revelation about Kerry and Jason reach her ears and pierce her heart. Then inappropriate sexual conduct and rape devolve into murder when Kerry turns up dead. By this time, NYPD detective Corrines interest becomes ever more intense as she tries to unravel the sexual and homicidal crimes.

Alafair Burke has quite the credentials: daughter of James Lee Burke, former prosecutor, currently a professor of law, and the author of several crime novel series. Add for good measure, her undergraduate major was psychology.

She feeds readers information slowly and evaluates the various bits though the eyes of Jason, Corrine, and Angela. She gives only Angela her own voice in first person, thus the title, and readers will be justified in wondering why. She tosses in plenty of red herrings to misdirect your attention and allay your ever increasing suspicions until the end. That ending smacks of a sequel to follow. The writing is serviceable. If this were summer, it would be the book to carry to the beach.

29243,4501,1131,"I know Im a little late to the program with this one as Ive been hearing people gush about this book for quite a while already  and rightly so!  I just finished it and what an amazing story!  Though The Hate U Give is marketed as a Young Adult book, I feel that this inspiring book that should be on everyones TBR list  regardless of age, gender or race.

--The Setting  --

The story revolves around and is told from the point of view of Star Carter, a 16 year old black girl who is trying to live in two different worlds:  one being Garden Heights, the all black crime-ridden neighborhood where she lives and grew up in   and the other being Williamson Prep, the predominately white upper middle-class high school to which her parents send her and her two brothers.

While at school, she carefully measures her behavior, limits her slang and generally portrays an easy-going attitude as she tries to fit in with her rich white schoolmates.  She even has a white boyfriend, Chris, whose existence shes not yet told her father about because shes worried hell judge her for dating a boy who isn't black.

Though it can be challenging at times, Staar is always careful to keep her two worlds separate.

--Her Family  --

Staar has a great relationship with her family and its evident that she loves them.  Her mother works at the hospital and is an excellent role model of a strong, no-nonsense woman. Her father, a former gang member, is now a respected member of the community having left his gang life behind and now works hard to provide for his children and be a positive role model for them. He owns the neighborhood grocery store at which Staar helps out from time to time.

But things aren't easy for Staar and her family.  She lives in a neighborhood where drive-by shootings, drug lords, gang leaders, and turf wars are a part of everyday life.

--The Incident  --

But one night her world is shattered when she and her childhood best friend Khalil are pulled over by a policeman for a routine traffic stop.  The officer pulls Khalil out of the car and, even though Khalil was unarmed and made no threatening moves toward the officer, the policeman shoots him in the back three times, killing him.
So Staar ends up being the only witness to what actually happened  and her life and the life of those around her entirely change as a result.  Though traumatized and enraged, Staar is faced with a choice:  stay silent or accept who she truly is in order to obtain justice for Khalil.

Now I will say that the scene of Khalils murder is horrifying and gut-wrenching, and regretfully, not uncommon, as many of us have seen on the news far too often in recent times. Still, that didn't make it this part of the book any easier  or less heartbreaking  to read.
The young mans funeral was equally heart-hurting, as we saw firsthand how destroyed his family and friends were. Instead of reading a byline in a newspaper or hearing a brief clip on the television, we are fully immersed in the situation in this story and are placed in the shoes of those who are directly involved.  In this way, the story was so raw and so real that at times, I forgot that I was reading fiction.
The author did an excellent job of bringing this story to life, allowing us to empathize with everyone involved. We read about the challenging issues facing the black community in the news, but this novel brought them to life for the reader, allowing us to see the lives behind the new bylines.  In this way, we cant help but realize that things are often a lot more complicated and multilayered than portrayed by the media.

--The Aftermath  --

Still grieving Khalils death, Staar is put in an extremely tough position given that shes the only witness to the incident.  Though it may seem clear to an outsider of what the best course of action is for her to take, things are not always as easy and clear-cut as they may seem  and its uncertain how we would react or not react if we found ourselves in a similar situation.
Following the aftermath of the shooting, I felt the author did an excellent job of portraying the fear, confusion, rage, and mistrust that Staar experiences as she processes her friends brutal murder and through it all, tries to find herself and her voice in the middle of the fallout.  But not only that, we see firsthand how such a violent, tragic and senseless loss can shake a community to its core.

--The Police  --

Though the officer clearly was at fault here, I felt that the author didn't demonize the police or place all of the blame on them.  Yes, there are definitely some bad police officers out there, but there are also good ones.

In fact, Staars uncle was a police officer who, on more than one occasion, let her know that not all of the officers at his precinct are trigger-happy racists and that many of his fellow officers vehemently disagreed with the action of their corrupt colleague and those like him.

--My Verdict  --

The Hate U Give is phenomenal.  This is the brutally honest kind of book that will stay with you for a long time after having read it and perhaps may cause you to look at life differently after having read it.  At the very least, it may cause us to question that which weve come to accept as normal. This was a gripping story that not only packed an emotional punch but was also an excellent fictional treatment of real-life racial issues facing America today.

 Though Ms. Thomas openly treats the issue of police brutality, she also demonstrates in a very real way the day to day violence plaguing inner-city neighborhoods. This is a timely book whose importance cannot be overstated.
Though the book deals with heavy issues and is not always comfortable to read, there are plenty of light and fun parts as well   especially the often amusing scenes in which Staar interacts with her friends and family.  While the book will make you cry, it will, in places, make you laugh with joy as well.

Throughout the book, the author weaves in themes of police brutality, racial profiling, hard choices, injustice, white privilege how young black men get pressured into dealing drugs, the challenges of living in gang-ridden neighborhoods, the everyday violence and danger that people living inner-city neighborhoods face  and does it with expert storytelling.

This is an honest and compelling book that I hope will be around and in peoples minds for many years to come.  Definitely a 5-star read for me.  Recommended!!!

29251,1363,1814,"I was a little worried when I first started this novel because it built up a little slowly. The main character is a young woman named Jazz who is immature and impulsive, yet very very smart. Shes involved in some petty crime that ramps up to industrial sabotage so I initially thought that was going to be somewhat of a ho-hum story line... luckily, about half way into the book the author gives us a nice twist that totally ups the stakes and sends Jazz and her comrades against some crazy obstacles that youd only see in an Andy Weir Space novel.

Mr Weir is an excellent author and knows his stuff. Since Im a former science teacher who has taught about space travel and moon colonies I thought I would be ahead of the ball here but he really took us readers to a new level of world building. Kudos to him!

He also portrayed the female character in a very realistic way, unlike some other male authors that I have read. I appreciate that he treated Jazz a fully realized person, flaws and all, not like some stereotypical cartoon character.

And, finally, I enjoyed his slightly profane sarcastic humor.

It was very uplifting to see the aid that poured into Halifax - money, medical personnel & supplies, building materials and the list goes on.

29270,4912,7,"This was not a love story at all. This was not a mystery, or science fiction. It was just a book about a girl, that so many of us, men and women, boys and girls, can relate to. Aza is all of us. She is highly intelligent, struggles with anxiety over germs and microbes, is constantly worrying about infections, and repeatedly re-opens callus on her finger in an effort to drain out what she believes are pathogens. There is a line in the book, that I was almost in shock when I read it; I was moved to trembling and I am not kidding. If you have ever had an internal struggle, then you will understand. It was on page 203:

""It's so weird, to know you're crazy and not be able to do anything about it, you know? It's not like you believe yourself to be normal. You know there is a problem. But you can't figure a way through to fixing it. Because you cant be sure, you know?""

That dialogue, between Aza and Davis, when they are our laying under the stars, is probably one of the most profound things I read in this entire book. John Green has captured what so many of us are thinking, and cannot put into words; and has put it into words. This whole book was wonderful. It took me so long to read this book, because I would continually put it down and walk away for a day, because I had to. I was too consumed.

29271,3145,3518,"The main message that I gathered from the book was simply taking personal responsibility, To stop blaming others for whatever terrible situation a person may find themselves in. To stand up straight with their shoulders back and accept that the world isn't gonna make these changes for them so they have to do it themselves. They have to dig deep, Accept their flaws and come up with ways to fix them. And it's not about just looking at one singular problem with one singular fix. You have to look at your entire life, genuinely address what is wrong and state what is wrong in the most brutally honest way possible because only then can you start fixing things. Only then can you start achieving satisfaction and happiness that may have previously eluded you.

I would not only strongly recommend the book, I have passed on my copy to a family member and plan to pass it onto more. Hopefully, Others who own it and who appreciated the content of this wonderful book will do the same.

29272,4906,7,"Aza seems normal enough on the outside, but on the inside, she couldn't feel further from normalcy. She suffers from an intense, ongoing worry of contracting C. diff. Despite this, her Star Wars loving friend Daisy and artist friend Mychal try their best to keep an air of normalcy in Azas life. When its discovered that a notable billionaire, whose son Aza previously was friends with, goes missing, Daisy decides they absolutely must solve this mystery. Embarking on a journey of rekindled sparks, tumultuous friendships, a strange reptile, and seemingly unsurpassable anxiety, Aza discovers there is more to herself and to the universe than she could have ever thought before.

While Looking for Alaska keeps its spot as my favorite John Green book, I still enjoyed reading Turtles All the Way Down. I really appreciated how Green depicted Azas anxiety and mental health issues, as I feel they were accurate for a teenager. He doesnt dumb it down or pretty it up, but displays it for its rawness. His concept of the thought spiral was one I could instantly relate to. At times, the novel was a bit too existential than seemed likely for a YA novel, but I still enjoyed it and welcomed a new read from Green nonetheless.",1520726400,4,aza seem normal enough outsid insid couldnt feel normalci suffer intens ongo worri contract c diff despit star war love friend daisi artist friend mychal tri best keep air normalci aza life discov notabl billionair whose son aza previous friend goe miss daisi decid absolut must solv mysteri embark journey rekindl spark tumultu friendship strang reptil seemingli unsurpass anxieti aza discov univers could ever thought look alaska keep spot favorit john green book still enjoy read turtl way realli appreci green depict aza anxieti mental health issu feel accur teenag doesnt dumb pretti display raw concept thought spiral one could instantli relat time novel bit existenti seem like ya novel still enjoy welcom new read green nonetheless

29274,4912,3865,"This book is probably on my top 10 favorite books of all time. Peter Heller is a fantastic writer. This was the perfect blend of dystopia, nonfiction, a touch of romance (not really that much but enough to fulfill lady readers that like that kind of thing), and suspense. Hig seems to be a broken lonley bit of a man when you first begin reading, but then you get to see who he really is as he faces what life is throwing at him during his time in the book. I love Cima's character and I could actually see her when Hig describes her in the book. She is the female character that I think most women wish we could be. Successful, sensual, full of confidence, nurturing, and exciting. Anyone should pick this book up to read it. You have to really understand this writing style, journal like. You get to see into Peter Hellers soul, there is some deep shit here. I actually cried a few time. As for his other books, he seems to like writing about animals, as his other books look similar in that sense. I am going to pick up Celine to read.

29275,4912,3518,"Heres the core message I took from this book. Life itself is about suffering. We are all suffering, we will suffer until we die. You can get through this suffering, if you follow some steps to try and get your life together. According to Jordan you have to tell the truth, fix what you can fix, and work towards making yourself a priority and making yourself strong. It sounds clich, but try it for just one day. You will go to bed feeling pretty good, but if you go back to your old habit the next day, then you have wasted your time. This is not something you do for a week and then you are sitting pretty. No man, this is about changing your whole damn life. Jordan tell us to focus on ourselves, because if you can fix yourself then how the heck do you think you could even begin to change the world around you? He asks you to assume responsibility for yourself. Peterson urges his readers to take on as much responsibility as they can handle, rather than whine about what they want, and don't have.

29276,703,3560,"If you are looking for a nice little fairy tale book this is very much not the book you're looking for. If you are looking for a darker, slightly bloodier, twisted tale take a gander at this one.
This book is good. It has a cast of characters the like of which hasn't been seen before, a world that's been created using fairy tale ideas but bending all the rules, and fun little twists and turns here and there to throw you off a bit. The book keeps you on your toes guessing what's going on and what will happen next.
The characters are all well defined and very much have their own personalities. Most of the time they are likeable. Sometimes you wish you could reach in there and give them a bit of a swat but that's about normal. It takes a fairly long time for the... action to pick up (I'm trying not to give anything at all away so just incase I'm being overly cautious about everything!) so the first hundred or so pages are a lot of build up but mostly needed for the tale I suppose.  The end wasn't exactly my favorite as it seemed just a tad bit rushed in certain parts but it did wrap nicely.
I think if you like the synopsis of the book, you should just read it. It tells you all you need to know to jump in without ruining anything for yourself. It's one of those books where it would be sort of be a shame if a spoiler got into the wrong eyes. It's more fun not knowing too much.
I think I'd like to rate this book at a 3.5 but on the high end of the .5 there so rounded up to the 4. It deserves the 4 more than a 3. I liked this book.

Malachi is told his future by a man named William Rumford, and he tries as hard as he can to escape it. Every scene that occurs in the book, you see his prophecy coming into play. No matter what he does, he cannot escape his future. The main theme though, I think, is that it doesnt matter how hard you try to escape it, there is a set plan for your life, and its going to happen. I don't know who makes that plan. God, Thor, Aphrodite, Zeus, hell maybe them all. There is also something else too though, that was important in the book that I think Vonnegut was saying.

29281,2515,1062,"Well, as I was about to pick up Blindsighted and having heard good things about Karin Slaughter (yes, this is the first book I have read of hers) I felt like there should be a sign saying: Welcome to Heartsdale, a small town in Georgia where many murders are about to commence!

Blindsighted revolves around three main characters.

First, there is Sara Linton, a pediatrician who also works as the town's coroner. Sara moved back to her hometown after finishing her residency in Atlanta. She's well respected and liked. She was married to the chief of Police, Jeffrey Tolliver until he cheated. She still cares for him but she tries to keep her distance.

Jeffrey knows he made a huge mistake when he hurt Sara and lost her at the same time. He has been trying to make amends without really gaining any ground. As the police chief, he's good at his job and he wants his town to be a safe place to live in.

Lena Adams is the only female cop in town. She's a smart woman. She also carries a lot of anger. She lost her parents when she was too young and she and her sister went to live with her uncle, Hank, who was a drug addict and alcoholic. Now as an adult, she doesn't have a good relationship with Hank but when her twin sister is found murdered in a dinner, her sole purpose in life is to find the man capable of such violence towards her twin.

Sara is the first one to find the victim. Because of her job, she will need to interact with Jeffrey. Lena is determined to find the murderer and get some justice even if she has to break protocol and defy her chief.

Blindsighted had a great cast. I like Sara. She was smart, resourceful and independent. I wasn't sure about Lena. She was too angry and defiant but by the end, I was hurting for her. Jeffrey, I'm not sure yet. He was good as a cop but he had no good excuse for cheating (just in case, there is NO excuse). I do feel like he loves Sara and I'm willing to wait and see where their relationship goes from here.

In regards to the unsub. He was EVIL. What he did to the women he kidnapped was unspeakable. I felt sick just reading those scenes. I don't know where Karin got her ideas but they were revolting.

Overall, I can say I enjoyed it and it grabbed my attention from beginning to end. Knowing this, I'm ready to continue with the rest of the books in this series. I already purchased Kisscut.

Cliffhanger: No

People were dying left and right, and there was some more adult material, but nothing too graphic on screen.

Jane is on the run again. In the first book of the series, Jane was on a quest to tell the world the truth about her husband's suicide. As a former FBI agent and now a fugitive, Jane is adept at dealing with the challenges in her journey. During her journey, she discovers more questionable deaths. There are many evil people who are against her discovering the truth. These people have no heart and no problem with murdering people to keep things quiet. That is why, despite how annoying Jane can be, you want to know more about this secret.

It is also a journey that proves Dean Koontz still knows how to scare you. The secret that the evil people are trying to hide seems very real.

29286,4449,1874,"I knew they would kill me when they found out, but He struggled for words, releasing a sharp breath. I think I realized that I would rather die because I betrayed them, than live because I betrayed you.

I am really enjoying this series! I love the world, the writing, the characters--everything. Marissa Meyer is very good at what she does. I'm not usually a fan of retellings, but these are amazing! The subtle references don't overpower the story, and you can see how Meyer took a thread from an old fairy tale and made it something new and entirely her own.

Also, the narrator! I know I've said this about her before, but Rebecca Soler is WONDERFUL.

Cinder was about Cinder, and Scarlet was about both Scarlet and Cinder. We see everything unfold from various perspectives, so we know what is happening in multiple places at once. There are so many different layers to these books; hidden nooks and crannies that are not fully realized until all of the pieces fall into place. I cannot stop listening once I start (which isn't good for getting things done).

I loved Scarlet and her no-nonsense personality. She was straightforward and determined in her efforts to find her grandmother. I admired her capabilities (she had no issues pointing a gun at someone's face), but thought she was a tad too eager to throw herself into dangerous situations.

Wolf was an interesting character, and I would love to know more of his history. I think I might get my wish in the next book, if how it ended is any indication.

I loathe Levana. She's vile, vain, and virtually untouchable.

I feel like everything is building toward something catastrophic, and I cannot wait to find out what that is! I'm so happy there are still more books in this series to read!

29287,4906,20,"Picture-perfect Shaker Heights is indeed shaken with the arrival of enigmatic Mia Warren and her perhaps genius daughter, Pearl.

The Richardsons have it all they live in the perfect suburb, have the perfect family, the perfect house or do they? This tour de force opens with the Richardsons perfect house on fire, and this fire seems to have been purposefully started by the youngest Richardson, Izzy. So much for perfect. How did such an enviable family end up in such an unenviable circumstance? The Warrens and their mysterious past could have been the spark that started it all, but perhaps the ignition was the controversial adoption of a Chinese baby by a notably white Shaker Heights family.

Celeste Ng has managed to create a literary masterpiece. Her choice of words, her language, are just beautiful and only add emphasis to her extraordinary character development of each and every major figure we meet in the novel. She creates layer after layer of complexity, having her readers struggle with which characters they should side with, which they should like, which they should dislike.

Mars has been terraformed, and a caste system of arbitrary Colors and slave labor holds up society. Darrow finds himself at the very bottom of society both literally and figuratively as a Red who mines underneath the surface of Mars. He believes he is making Mars habitable for future generations; unbeknownst to him, Mars has been habitable for many generations and his people have been oppressed for years, all for the benefit of the high-Colors. With the pushing of his wife and a life-altering revelation, Darrow is pushed to the surface and seeks justice for his Reds.

Pierce Browns words are simply stunning, and manage to reach right into his readers hearts. He succeeds in creating the perfect blend of dystopia, heart-wrenching romance, intriguing futuristic technology, and social commentary. The only wish I had for this novel (hence, my 4 star rating) is more of the life and experiences of the Reds.

Peter Mayle's book picked up where Patty and Doug's descriptions left off.

The eccentric people of Provance sound charming and move at a different pace than cosmopolitan people.  It is farm country and the people must be self-sufficient in everything they do, from construction work to cooking.  The book gave such vivid descriptions of the food and varieties of wine ( and the importance of the mid-day meal) that one would always be hungry after reading.

29299,1332,2570,"I listened to author Barry on a C-SPAN3 program talking about this topic - found him interesting (especially his short diversions into the backgrounds of some of the day's medical scientists), and having a detailed knowledge of the topic. So, it was almost inevitable that I went on to read his book.

Paul Lewis, brought in by the Navy, was on of the early researchers to first be confronted by rows of hospitalized men, most with severe headaches, many with nosebeeds or bleeding from their ears, and suffering horribly. (Some coughed so hard they tore apart abdoiminal muscles and rib cartilage.) Some looked so dark it was difficult to tell if they were Caucasian or Negro. Previously Lewis had proven that a virus caused polio at the Rockefeller Institute, then developed a vaccine that protected monkeys with nearly 100% effectiveness. Lewis had been called after over 700 had been hospitalized within four days of the arrival of a ship carrying 87 then ill sailors. Lewis quickly guess that the cause was an influenza unlike any known before. Before that pandemic faded in 1920, it killed more people than any other outbreak of disease in history. (The 1300s plague killed a higher proportion - more than one-quarter of Europe. The lowest estimate is 21 million, more likely 50 million, possibly 100 million.)

Normally influenza mostly kills the elderly and infants, but in the 1918 pandemic, about half who died were young men/women. As many as 8 - 10% of all young adults may have been killed by the virus, more than in the Great War itself.  The primary cause of death was humorrhaging pneumonia. The incubation period was about 1 - 3 days, after which death could come rapidly.

About two-thirds of the deaths occurred in a period of 24 weeks, withmore than half between mid-September to early December 1918. The Great Influenza killed more people in a year than the Black Death of the Middle Ages killed in a century. It's mortality rate was 2.5%, vs. prior influenza epidemics of less than 0.1%.

There was also a shortage of the number of physicians and other health-care professionals available - first, because large numbers were part of the war effort, and second because many of those remaining became sick and died. Meanwhile, stores could not hold sales, funerals were limited to 15 minutes, some towns required signed certificates to enter - and railroads would not accept passengers without them.

The pandemic likely originated in the U.S., most likely SW Kansas in 1918, then moving to Fort Riley (56,000 troops) via Dean Nilson who had returned home on leave and/or new recruit John Bottom , and from there to Europe - especially France. In August the virus turned into a much more deadly form. Soldiers were disproportionately more affected by the virus due to their close contact with each others. They were transported to kill the enemies - and the virus made them much more lethal than any would have believed. Public gatherings could become deadly - the Liberty Loan Parade in Philadelphia (9/28/1918) was followed by hundreds of thousands of new cases and almost 1,000 died each day for several weeks.

There are many more species of influenza in birds than humans. Even under rare circumstances when a person gets infected, that virus does not normally pass from one human to another. The real danger comes when that virus mutates and obtains the ability to more easily infect human beings. Influenza virus infects cells lining the surface of the respiratory system and is usually restricted to the upper respiratory tract before the immune system wipes it out within ten days. Normally, influenza kills about 36,000 each year in the U.S., usually in the very young and very old with compromised or not fully developed immune systems. The influenza virus mutates quickly, and when the 100,000 - 1 million progeny viruses are ready to burst open (and kill) the host cell, 99% have mutated so greatly that they are incapable of infecting another cell. The remaining 1,000 - 10,000 viruses are. Their mutations also prevent existing antibodies from attacking, and the virus spreads unchecked. Public health authorities now order the killing of millions of poultry and many pigs when a dangerous variant (1997 Hong Kong, 2003 Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) appears to reduce the chance of starting a pandemic.

Lewis died in 1029 from Yellow Fever in Brazil while studying that disease. His protg (Richard Shope) used Lewis's methodology of using a filter to separate a virus from bacteria, and confirmed Lewis's prior suspicion that the 1918 Influenza was caused by a virus. Barry also reveals that many influenza casualties resulted from uninformed and misguided decisions by military and political leaders. But first he reports on how medicine had to become scientific before it could itself be effective.

Up to a few decades prior to WWI, medicine had remained almost unchanged from Hippocrates over 2,00 years prior. As late as 1900, it was more difficult to get into a respectable American college than an American medical school - at most 20% required just a high school diploma for admission. Students could fail several courses, never touch a patient, and still get a medical degree. It wasn't until shortly before WWI began that American medicine began serious change.

Bleeding can help in rare diseases, such as a rare genetic disorder that causes people to make too much blood or when the blood carries too much iron. In more common cases of acute pulmonary edema, when the llungs fill with fluid, it can also relieve immediate syptoms. And in Congestive heart failure, excess fluid in the lungs can make victims very uncomfortable and kill them if the heart cannot pump the fluit out. Physicians also believed that bleeding helped those flushed with a fever - if it made the patient pale.",1520726400,5,listen author barri cspan3 program talk topic found interest especi short diver background day medic scientist detail knowledg topic almost inevit went read book paul lewi brought navi earli research first confront row hospit men sever headach mani nosebe bleed ear suffer horribl cough hard tore apart abdoimin muscl rib cartilag look dark difficult tell caucasian negro previous lewi proven viru caus polio rockefel institut develop vaccin protect monkey nearli 100 effect lewi call 700 hospit within four day arriv ship carri 87 ill sailor lewi quickli guess caus influenza unlik known pandem fade 1920 kill peopl outbreak diseas histori 1300 plagu kill higher proport onequart europ lowest estim 21 million like 50 million possibl 100 million normal influenza mostli kill elderli infant 1918 pandem half die young menwomen mani 8 10 young adult may kill viru great war primari caus death humorrhag pneumonia incub period 1 3 day death could come rapidli twothird death occur period 24 week withmor half

God I don't know. One thing I will say for Margaret Atwood and her writing in this book, she is very good at reminding us of all the modern things that we take for granted (like clothes, shoes, good food, and maybe even sex). The beginning is slow, but I think that she thought that was necessary to introduce you into the monotony of Offred's life. It picks up around chapter 11 and gets mildly interesting. She has some fantastic quotes in here too. And, I have actually have always cared what happened to Offred, but have never just figured it out. This book is definitely a reminder of things I have read about feminism in the 1970s, when the movement was just beginning to really take shape, but we have really come so far now right?

Its also a television movie released in 2017 by Nickelodeon.

My Take
Its all about learning, never giving up, and the importance of working as a teamand how fabulous the library isespecially once you learn how to use it! Grabenstein turns it all into a game, a great game that could inspire your own kids to make use of the libraryor at least the idea of how knowledge can be useful. Lord knows, Grabenstein had me stumped on a number of clues.

Id have to agree with the assessment that Escape from Mr. Lemoncellos Library is a cross between [Roald Dahl's] Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and [the film and novelization of] A Night in the Museum , as Chris Grabenstein uses rib-tickling humor to create the perfect tale for his quirky characters  with the crafty twists and turns of this ultimate library experience with interactive possibilities. Its helpful that he uses a third person omniscient point-of-view to allow us to listen in to the thoughts and feelings and watch the actions of different kids as they pursue the game.

I did love the concept of the initial scavenger game the boys played, although Im not sure parents would be too pleased with it. Then again, it focuses on a young man who isn't big on books, but does adore games of all sorts. If this adventure can get Kyle to want to read, well I had to laugh as Kyle keeps finding books he wants to readYES!!

I suppose you could consider this a fantasy book as well, since the too-funny Mr. Lemoncello is too odd for words, and as for a world-famous librarian? Well, whoda thunk? And the money spent on the librarywhoa!! Then all those parents being cool with their kids having to ""escape"" the library? Only in books, lol.

I do like Kyle, and he has quite a generous spirit. Grabensteins other characters run the gamut of types with those with a sense of responsibility, those who hide behind a mask, those with a superior air, and the cheaters.

The story is FULL of foreshadowing, that was obvious to me afterwards! Better not count on me in these games!
A library doesnt need windows, Andrew. We have books, which are windows into worlds we never even dreamed possible.
Its going on my buy list! And if you want to encourage your kids to think outside the box and find learning fun, you'll be picking it up too.

The Story
The real challenge isn't getting IN to Mr. Lemoncellos library, it's getting OUT!

Twelve-year-old Kyle Keeley enters an essay contest and wins an overnight stay in his hometowns new and technologically enhanced town library funded by Mr. Lemoncello, a game board creator.

Once inside the library, Kyle and his fellow essay winners discover they will need to play their way out of the library, using clues left by Mr. Lemoncello in the ultimate board game come to life!

The Characters
Kyle Keeley is twelve with a love for games...but not for books. Mike is his oldest brother, seventeen, and a high school superstar jock. Curtis is fifteen and the more intellectual of the three. Their parents are keen on the kids being active.

Kyles fellow students
Akimi Hughes is one of Kyles particular friends. The super enthusiastic Miguel Fernandez is president of the schools Library Aide Society. Sierra Russell always has her nose buried in a book. Her parents have recently split up. The snooty, brown-nosing Charles Chiltington (his uncle, James F. Willoughby, III, is the head librarian of the Library of Congress) knows he's the best. Andrew Peckleman is a library aide. Haley Daley is the class princess. Bridgette Wadge, Yasmeen Smith-Snyder, Sean Keegan, Rose Vermette, and Kayla Corson are more students who won the contest. Mrs. Dana Cameron is Kyles homeroom teacher. Mrs. Yunghans is the school librarian.

Mr. Luigi Lemoncello is a master game maker whose games are always a little goofy around the edges. Just like him. He was born in Alexandriaville into an Italian family with nine siblings. Dr. Yanina Zinchenko is a world-famous librarian who will be the new head librarian. Gail Tobin had been the librarian back when Mr. Lemoncello was a boy.

Twinky is the neighbors Doberman.

The Cover and Title
The cover is grayed-out color-wise in its minty greens, pinks, yellows, and blues. Its definitely all about the game with its dot counters, die, and spin-the-wheel with the silhouette of kids interacting with the library. Theres one sitting atop a slanted billboard announcing the title in a combination of script font (in white) and a gradated yellow in a showy circus-type of font with a minty green balloon, all against a deep green background bordered in layers of white. Its a clever way to announce the series information as well. Theres a gray striped kitty stretching atop a wooden bookcase and what looks like a vintage minty green phonograph horn silhouetted against a pale gray full moon in the upper right corner of a gradated green sky full of sparkling white stars and lines of those game counters in pastel colors. Below the billboard is a sweeping curve of staircase leading up with bookcases on either side and more game counters on the stairs and spreading out onto the floor. Another silhouette is pulling down hard on the arrow of the wheel on the lower right while another is walking along, engrossed in her book, and the fourth silhouette is prancing past the stairway. The authors name uses the same circus-style font in white, centered at the bottom.

The title is the name of the game, Escape From Mr. Lemoncello's Library.",1520726400,5,first mr lemoncello librari adventur mysteri seri middlegrad reader revolv around gamesman sen fun focu cheeki young kyle keeley ador fan live alexandriavil ohio escap mr lemoncello librari nomin multitud award 2016 grand canyon reader award intermedi golden sower award chapter book pacif northwest librari associ young reader choic award junior divis maud hart lovelac book award william allen white child book award magnolia award virginia reader choic elementari mark twain reader award volunt state book award intermedi 35 2015 escap mr lemoncello librari garden state book award maryland blackey susan book award grade 46 blue hen book award best childrensyoung adult novel main student book award flicker tale child book award juvenil book dorothi canfield fisher child book award rhode island child book award 2014 sunshin state young reader award elementari grade 35 great stone face award buckey child book award 35 2013 agatha award best childrensyoung adult novel escap mr lemoncello librari nomin 2016 bluestem book award young hoosier book award 2015 pennsylvania young reader choic award grade 68 2014 anthoni award best child young adult novel also televis movi releas 2017 nickelodeon take learn never give import work teamand fabul librari isespeci learn use

29308,813,1668,"World Without End by Ken Follett is the second book in the Kingsbridge series. Mr. Follett is a bestselling author who lives in England.

The book is over 1,000 pages. Ill do my best to give a quick synopsis but it certainly does not encompass the scale of the story.

In 1327, four children run into the woods surrounding the town of Kingsbridge, England on All Hallows Day. The children are Merthin, his brother Ralph, Caris and Gwenda witness a knight killing two men-at-arms in self-defense. Everyone runs with the exception of Merthin who helps the knight, Sir Thomas Langley, hide a secret before seeking refuge in the local monastery.

Each of the friends finds their own way in life based on their station in life and skill. Merthin becomes a carpenter with an eye for detail and seeing diagrams in 3D, Ralph joins the army, Caris seems to be interested in medicine (which only male monks practice) and Gwenda tries to win the heart of a local farmer.

I very much enjoyed The Pillars of the Earth, the authors first book in the Kingsbridge series and always wanted to read the rest of the series. My wife bought me World Without End by Ken Follet as a gift, which I immediately made time in my reading schedule for.

As in the first book, I loved the historical research and detailed portrayal of the Middle Ages in England. While the story is basically a soap opera set in a small town, the accurate (as far as I can tell) research and rich storytelling allows an interesting and well developed narrative to triumph.

Even though the book, like its predecessor, is very long it is still very entertaining. The whole book was very well written, its actually impressive that the author can keep up the quality of writing for 1,000+ pages.

This is one of those books where I found myself looking forward to reading, and dreading finishing it. Usually its difficult for me to read on the weekends (kids, going out, etc.), but I found myself turning off (more likely tuning off) the TV and reading.

This book is easy to follow, while the cast is big its not hard to remember whos who (Mr. Follett seems to be aware of this issue and reminds the reader every once in a while the history of the character).

29318,740,3867,"Ecstacy: A Novel by Mary Sharratt is a mostly fictional work about the life of Alma Maria Schindler Mahler Gropius Werfel, who famously married Gustav Mahler, a brilliant composer and conductor. Alma herself was a composer of some promise, had her husband not insisted she give up composing for marriage. This book centers around Alma's coming of age and her 9 year marriage to Mahler.

Alma was born in Vienna in 1879 to famous artist Emil Jakob Schindler and she grew up surrounded by artists of all types. Indeed, Gustav Klimt was her first romance. Alma herself had a gift for music and was an accomplished pianist who began composing at a young age. Sadly, she was born at a time when women were expected to marry and have children and few pursued their own talents.

This book, while being historically accurate with respect to Alma's famous friends, lovers and husbands, as well as her travels and mental breakdowns, it is mostly a fictional novel about her internal frustrations surrounding Mahler's insistence that she give up her musical aspirations as well as her sexual frustrations. Mahler was a difficult man to live with as he was substantially older than Alma and driven to compose - at times, almost day and night. The marriage suffered greatly at the death of one of their children and cause Alma to fall into a deep depression. During a cure at a sanatorium, she began a tumultuous affair with famous architect Walter Gropius, who founded Bauhaus. This nearly ended the marriage but they reconciled and remained married until Mahler's death.

As I have always been fascinated with the Vienna Secession and the artists that came into their own during that time, I found that part of the book to be extremely interesting. However, I found the author's portrayal of Alma offputting to some extent and the language to be a bit too flowery at times. Alma was clearly an intelligent and talented woman but she often comes off as flighty and fickle and overly dramatic. She may indeed have been all of those things and certainly the times did not encourage women to be ""bluestockings"", it was still irritating given the incredibly exciting and artistic social circles she moved in.

Still, I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more from Ms. Sharratt.",1520726400,4,ecstaci novel mari sharratt mostli fiction work life alma maria schindler mahler gropiu werfel famous marri gustav mahler brilliant compos conductor alma compos promis husband insist give compos marriag book center around alma come age 9 year marriag mahler alma born vienna 1879 famou artist emil jakob schindler grew surround artist type inde gustav klimt first romanc alma gift music accomplish pianist began compos young age sadli born time woman expect marri child pursu talent book histor accur respect alma famou friend lover husband well travel mental breakdown mostli fiction novel intern frustrat surround mahler insist give music aspir well sexual frustrat mahler difficult man live substanti older alma driven compos time almost day night marriag suffer greatli death one child caus alma fall deep depress cure sanatorium began tumultu affair famou architect walter gropiu found bauhau nearli end marriag reconcil remain marri mahler death alway fascin vienna secess artist came time found part book extrem interest howev found

These comical, yet eye-opening essays gives readers a deep look into Trevor Noahs life growing up in apartheid South Africa. His memoir opens with himself as a child, having to jump from a moving bus with his mother to escape men who were out to hurt them. From the beginning, its clear to see that Noah did not have an easy upbringing. However, it is just this that formed him into the charming character we know him as today.

Noahs charm illuminates throughout these pages, and he incorporates his comedian personage to make for some humor-filled narrative. However, there is much to learn from this memoir. I found myself discovering more about South African apartheid through Noahs words than Id ever known previously. He manages to create a unique balance of comedy and historical education I have yet to encounter in any other memoir Ive read up until now.

29321,813,3126,"How to Stop Time by Matt Haig is a novel that follows the life of a man who lived for hundreds of years. Mr. Haig wrote a memoir, award winning childrens books, and several novels.

Tom Hazzard is aging slowly, about one year for every ten of a regular human. He has lived for centuries, known Shakespeare, sailed with Captain Cook and fell in love.

Now in back London, Tom is a history teacher with a unique view of history, he has discovered that there are others like him, in a Society to keep their secret from zealots, politicians, and scientists. Tom has been looking for his daughter for hundreds of years, the Society has promised to help him, but it looks like they're just using him to do their dirty work instead.

The first thing I thought about when I read the description for How to Stop Time by Matt Haig is the graphic novel (later a successful movie and TV series) Highlander. This book is not the same, but there are some similarities along the way, but not to worry, it is a far cry from the story.

I enjoyed this book, I wish it would have been a series which could be expended since the author touches on several storylines, but due to size has to rush through them. There is the story of the history teacher that actually lived the history. The story of a man out of time, looking for companionship knowing full well that it would be a hurtful, and relatively short relationship. Most interesting there is the story of a man out of place and time, searching for his daughter, for centuries, who is also out of place and time.

I enjoyed the descriptions of historical London, the walks which the protagonist takes through the town, remembering the old buildings and events is a fascinating way to tell the story. The story moves fast, the narrative is clear despite the multiple timelines and stories.

I am much too cynical of a man to enjoy sugary love-will-conquer-all endings, but I can certainly see how most people would like it.",1520726400,4,stop time matt haig novel follow life man live hundr year mr haig wrote memoir award win child book sever novel tom hazzard age slowli one year everi ten regular human live centuri known shakespear sail captain cook fell love back london tom histori teacher uniqu view histori discov other like societi keep secret zealot politician scientist tom look daughter hundr year societi promis help look like theyr use dirti work instead first thing thought read descript stop time matt haig graphic novel later success movi tv seri highland book similar along way worri far cri stori enjoy book wish would seri could expend sinc author touch sever storylin due size rush stori histori teacher actual live histori stori man time look companionship know full well would hurt rel short relationship interest stori man place time search daughter centuri also place time enjoy descript histor london walk protagonist take

29323,4906,33,"Jason is content with his life. Still, he cant help thinking what if? When Jason is kidnapped, he gets to live out all of his what ifs. But what if this alternate life isn't all its cracked out to be?

In this sci-fi thriller, Jason has chosen his wife and son over his passion for physics. When hes transported to a world where he did not choose his wife and son, he gets to live out his dreams of being a successful scientist. But is this life real? Is it his? How did he get here? Did the life he remembers with his wife and son actually happen? Is it still happening? These questions will confuse you, but push you to read onwards; once the answers are discovered, youll be in for a mind-bending journey through reality (or realities?) itself.

Crouchs novel combines science and love in such an appealing way, that his story grabs at the hearts and minds of both sci-fi lovers and romance lovers alike. While, at times, the more science-y parts of the novel confused me a bit, the whole concept of alternate realities was intriguing and enjoyable to read. I think this concept is meant to confuse the reader, as it truly is a perplexing one to think about. Crouch also forces his readers to deeply reflect on Jasons moral dilemma: family or career? Love or success? Cant we have both? This novel truly puts readers on a riveting journey of not only figuring out what has happened to Jason, but also contemplating what you would do if you were thrust into Jasons life (or, lives).",1520726400,4,jason content life still cant help think jason kidnap get live if altern life isnt crack scifi thriller jason chosen wife son passion physic he transport world choos wife son get live dream success scientist life real get life rememb wife son actual happen still happen question confus push read onward answer discov youll mindbend journey realiti realiti crouch novel combin scienc love appeal way stori grab heart mind scifi lover romanc lover alik time sciencey part novel confus bit whole concept altern realiti intrigu enjoy read think concept meant confus reader truli perplex one think crouch also forc reader deepli reflect jason moral dilemma famili career love success cant novel truli put reader rivet journey figur happen jason also contempl would thrust jason life live
29324,206,1952,"Ron Chernow has recently become quite the legend in the literary world.  Not only was his biography of Alexander Hamilton so well received, but it was even made into arguably the most famous musical of the last quarter century. Although Ive never seen it, I imagine much of the interest in picking up that book resulted from one having a piqued interest having seen such a well-received Broadway musical. So it shouldnt surprise anyone when his next book (this one) following those rave reviews of the perpetually sold-out hit instantly becomes a talked-about item in various literary circles.

Fortunately, this biography is just as good as Hamilton. Will it also be made into a musical? I hope not. Seriously, though, this is quite simply a wonderful account of one of the most influential leaders in the history of the United States.  Its fairly long  over 1,100 pages.  We must remember that Grant led quite the life and was not only the commanding General of the Union army during the Civil War, but also a two-term president. So theres an awful lot that can be written about a man who was smack dab in the middle of so much history.  What this means is that the 1,100 pages (961 is actual reading. The rest is indices, footnotes, etc.) is never boring. It also helps that Grant is such an affable hero. Theres almost nothing to dislike about him.

Whenever I see pictures of Ulysses S. Grant, or see him represented in films, he always appears very dirty, gruff, and unkept. We always see him chomping on a ubiquitous cigar and there are rumors that he had a serious problem with alcohol.  What surprised me the most about this biography was that Grant was quite the sweetheart. He was actually a very gentle, mild-mannered, caring soul. In fact, its these characteristics that doom him throughout his life. Hes simply too trustworthy and finds himself taken advantage of time after time causing him to lose employment, money and prestige. Hes actually a failure at his many business undertakings, not because he lacks the mental capacity, but because he refuses to fathom that others around him can be quite ruthless and unsavory.

The one thing that Grant CAN do is lead an army in battle. After reading this book, you become convinced that this was his sole purpose in life. He proves this during the Mexican War as low grade officer. When the Civil War breaks out less than 15 years later, hes basically the only commander of the Union army who knows how to command. His efforts are mostly secondary in the newsworthy department because his battles are way out west.  The focus back then was mostly on the clashes closer to home (Washington D.C.) where the Union falters time and time again with numerous incompetent generals. In fact, one becomes convinced that had Grant been the commanding general at the start of the war, the conflict would have been over in about four months.  On the other hand, had he not been around at all, you could make a strong case that the Confederates would have won the war.

His turning point comes around 1864 when Lincoln puts him in charge. Hes loved by everyone north of the Mason-Dixon line, and people are already talking about him as the next president.  This notion, in Grants eyes, is utterly preposterous. Well, at the conclusion of the Civil War, Lincoln is assassinated shortly into his second term, and his Vice-President Andrew Johnson becomes the unlikely commander in chief. Its too lengthy to go into all the details here, but Andrew Johnson was probably the worst President in U.S. history and manages to royally screw up many of Lincolns ideas for civil rights, reconstruction, and the treatment of the former slaves. One almost gets the idea that Johnson could have led the country into another civil war.
So Grant feels obliged to run for president. Despite what some say, Grant appears to be a diehard abolitionist (unlike Lincoln) and cant fathom how poorly the black population is being treated.  Fortunately, he gets elected.  Progress is very slow, but at least it goes in the right direction.  Sadly, it took almost another 100 years before the country would pass a Civil Rights bill. Go back and read that last sentence about fifty times.

His administration isn't flawless. Mistakes are made. Quite often, though, these mistakes are made by his cabinet and other subordinates. Unfortunately, the buck stops with the Commander in Chief, and Grant still is too gentle and trustworthy of a soul.  The author maintains that Grant was actually a pretty good president and deserves fairer treatment from historians.  Obviously, the author is a big fan, and there are times when he seems a bit too strong of an apologist.  Especially when it comes to Grants drinking.  We read a lot about Grants drinking. While the author admits Grant did have a weakness, he seems to dismiss a lot of the stories told by others as innuendo.  And there are quite a lot of stories.  I guess well never know for sure.  Too bad YouTube wasn't around then.

Anyway, after Grant finishes his presidency, we read just enough about his waning years. He actually considers running for a third term later in his life for the same reasons he ran the first time, but times have changed and its not to be.  Sadly, Grant dies rather prematurely after a painful bout with throat cancer (20 cigars per day will do that do you), and he spends his declining years recording his memoirs while striking up a strong friendship with Mark Twain.
I loved this book. The main difference between this and the biography of Hamilton is that this narrative felt much more linear.  I felt I was reading much more about the man and not so much about the events. Yes, the events are covered (how could they not be?), but they seemed to be given a bit less attention than the man himself.  One wishes that every key figure in history could have such a wonderful, detailed and, most importantly, interesting biography written about them.

Very highly recommended.",1520726400,5,ron chernow recent becom quit legend literari world biographi alexand hamilton well receiv even made arguabl famou music last quarter centuri although ive never seen imagin much interest pick book result one piqu interest seen wellreceiv broadway music shouldnt surpris anyon next book one follow rave review perpetu soldout hit instantli becom talkedabout item variou literari circl fortun biographi good hamilton also made music hope serious though quit simpli wonder account one influenti leader histori unit state fairli long 1100 page must rememb grant led quit life command gener union armi civil war also twoterm presid there aw lot written man smack dab middl much histori mean 1100 page 961 actual read rest indic footnot etc never bore also help grant affabl hero there almost noth dislik whenev see pictur ulyss grant see repres film alway appear dirti gruff unkept alway see chomp ubiquit cigar rumor seriou problem alcohol surpris biographi grant quit sweetheart actual

29328,1779,3403,"Imagine you've come into school during the summer to take care of odds and ends. Imagine, suddenly, inexplicably, a bomb going off. Then another. And another. Suddenly you're trapped with a small group of kids you don't know very well, and every single one of you seems to be harboring a secret. As the media and police gather outside the school, you have to make up your mind: do you trust yourself and those around you enough to try to get out? Even if one of you is the bomber?

Joelle Charbonneau's TIME BOMB is clearly ripped from today's headlines. It's a bit didactic in spots (near the end, it practically becomes a PSA), and there are too many main characters who all seem to have troubles that are a bit too on-the-nose and, frankly, similar. Those are the main flaws. But ultimately, it's a fun, brisk ride, with a healthy dose of suspense that doesn't talk down to its audience too much.

29329,2402,3154,"PUBLIC SECRETS was written in 1990. The story covers the years of mid 1960s to 1990. The mores of that time are quite different from 2018.

The story is about a small child, Emma, who was taken from an abusive mother by her rock star father. Sex, drugs, smoking and alcohol are a major part of his lifestyle. The father's new baby is killed in an attempted kidnapping and witnessed by Emma. In her terror she runs for help and falls down the stairs blocking out the memory. The baby's death breaks up the family and nearly breaks up the father's band when the killers are not caught. The story continues for twenty some years until Emma starts to remember the death of her brother.

Again, Nora Roberts is excellent at plotting and weaving her stories and characters. As the years go by and Emma grows to adult many characters pass through her life and return.

29332,4912,1563,"Eleanor is a big red headed girl who dresses weird and is new to town. Nobody wants her to sit beside them on the school bus, because she is different. Park, a tall, skinny, Asian kid, has some popular friends, but also has a deep seeded need to be introverted. He feels sorry for her and lets her sit beside him. He does this with an internal promise to keep 6 inches of space between them, or this is what tells himself. He reads comic books on the bus and she is too poor to even own a book, so she reads over his shoulder. He sees that she is reading his comic books, and for whatever reason he begins to turn the pages slower, so that she can follow along too. That unconscious move of compassion on his part, builds a bridge between the span of those six inches. As time passes, they share books, music, and the dark humor over the other people they go to school with. This book is written in alternating points of view, which in my opinion, makes the book so much better. You get to see both of their reactions, and how they play out to one another. It made me love their characters that much more. The things that made Park and Eleanor different to everyone else in their lives, were also the things that they found to be the same in each other. The characters really connected, even being from opposite ends of the spectrum. She came from a very poor, abuse stricken home, and just somehow managed to survive every day. He came from a comfortable middle class home that was often full of love, but sometimes had a tinge of that condescending banter that might sometimes push an on the fence depressed person over the edge. That is where Park was, on the edge, and Eleanor was already on the other side waiting for him. Maybe thats what makes pain more bearable, is knowing there is someone else out there, waiting on the other side. This was not a love story, this was a story about hope, and friendship, and maybe something more.

I picked up this book out of the hope to find a narrative I could relate to, and something that would lay further groundwork for my own healing and recovery. It ended up being a little hard for me to read - the book's most detailed moment graphically depict the physical abuse that Sean causes Tara, her father's endangerment of everyone who works in his junkyard (and manipulation and threats to everyone who doesn't), and the gaslighting her family directs at her when she speaks out against her abuse. This makes me think I may not have quite been the target audience for the book. I had to wait until the end of the book for the resolution I was hoping for, and even then it surprised me with more family loyalty than distance (if also resilience and better understanding) - reminding me that there's no such thing as a clean narrative of abuse.

Aside from my own personal relationship to the narrative, I thought it was a really meaningful and important story to tell.

29348,567,3823,"I put off reading LAKE SILENCE for quite a while. I was scared that I wouldn't love it like I loved the previous books in the Others series with the different setting and characters. I am happy to report that I was worried for no reason and that I loved LAKE SILENCE just as much as its predecessors.

I DID miss Meg, Simon and the rest of the Lakeside Courtyard crew, but Vicki and her new friendsboth human and Otherwere easy to like, easy to root for and so much fun to get to know. Vicki has a lot of insecurities and doubts throughout LAKE SILENCE. If you're looking for a romance, you won't get it. She isn't ready to trust men romantically yet after the disaster that was her marriage, but she is on her way there.

I loved learning about another part of the world. The town and the people really helped make the story. We don't have that Courtyard feel of the last books, but there is definitely a community.

I would have liked to get to know the Others better. We get a lot of information on the humans of the group, but we only got a few tidbits about the others.

29349,899,3114,"Gah, these books are amazinggg!!! Seriously, this sequel might have told from the perspectives of new characters and entirely new setting, but it's nonetheless equally as thrilling, heart-pounding, romantic, shocking, spellbinding, and will have you frantically turning the pages to find out what happens next... and who will be standing. This story was just as gripping as ILLUMINAE, and was filled with intense action, monsters, and wickedly intense science, and it actually ties in really well to the overarching series. While Ezra and Kady are still my most beloved, but Nik and Hanna are absolutely amazing. While it took me a little while to warm up to Hanna, it's impossible to deny how strong and motivated and ultimately awesome she is. A warrior in all sense of the word. Nik is also very interesting, tragic and complex. Ella is also completely hilarious and someone whom I'm missing right at this moment. The design of the book is even more impressive than in the first book (though I might be a little biased since some of the sketches were drawn by Marie Lu, one of my favourite authors), and it adds to the immersion.

29356,412,3791,"ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK is a true crime classic for the 21st century. In a gripping 328 pages, Michelle McNamara chronicles a sprawling list of heinous crimes committed in California during the 70s and 80s by the Golden State Killer, a moniker coined by the author. At least 50 rapes and 10 murders have been attributed to this individual, who to this day has never been caught. Aside from trauma, loss and shattered lives, the responsible party left little behind --- nothing more than a few cryptic, tantalizing clues that have stymied investigators and amateur sleuths alike for decades. And despite a rap sheet that rivals some of the United States most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer remains relatively unknown. Until now.

With ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK, McNamara has converted years of painstaking research into a compulsively readable account of the people whose lives were transformed by a monster, and the race against time to bring him into the light.

His identity matters not a whit to me. I want him captured; I don't care who he is. Looking at such a mans face is anticlimactic; attaching a name, even more so. We know what he did; any information beyond that will inevitably feel pedestrian, pale, somehow clich. These words belong not to McNamara but to author Gillian Flynn, who has written the  introduction to ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK. What I found so particularly striking about this statement is just how well it sets the tone for the book, encapsulating the pathos McNamara brings to the investigation. This is not to say that she isn't consumed by the mystery that surrounds the killers identity. Quite the contrary: she is so consumed that she confesses her anxiety over her all-encompassing obsession with this case to the reader multiple times, worrying over it to the point that she remarks on how certain aspects of her hunt for the Golden State Killer mirror his inability to control his urges to stalk and terrorize.

The very premise of the book hinges on unmasking the villain. However, the empathy McNamara has for the victims and those who have dedicated their lives to investigating the Golden State Killer weaves a humanizing sensitivity into horror that, in less capable hands, could be easily exploited for shock value. Of course, the focal point of ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK is solving the great whodunit, but the books true significance lies in its treatment of the people who find themselves connected to the perpetrator, whether by choice or by circumstance. The end result deglamorizes the myth of the serial killer and helps deliver at least some power into the hands of those who want him to see justice.

ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK is very nearly perfect, and if McNamara had lived to complete it, I can only imagine just how incredible it would have been. Sadly, she passed away unexpectedly in 2016, and it was left to her lead researcher and a close colleague to take on the daunting task of finishing her work. Though they do an admirable job overall, its hard not to see these posthumous chapters as lacking. I missed McNamaras effervescent writing style and found the density of some pages difficult to engage with. Still, her collaborators manage to maintain the spirit of her investigation, which happily carried me through the book until its end.

I absolutely loved ILL BE GONE IN THE DARK. Its a must-read for any true crime fan. Upon finishing, I only wish that the world could have been fortunate enough to have received more work from this brilliant woman. But perhaps with this book, she has given us one final gift: the chance to one day see the Golden State Killer behind bars.

29357,72,3058,"Kate Andersen Brower was once the White House correspondent for Bloomberg News.  While there she got invited to a luncheon of First Lady Michelle Obama's and noticed the butlers quietly moving about in the background and became interested in them and them and in the rest of the staff.  Getting former staff to talk to her (she only got one current member of the White House residence staff to talk to her) proved to be a difficult task.  They were fiercely loyal even after all these years.  Some refused to say a bad word about any of the first families no matter what.  But Brower would get them to open up and once they found out that others were talking it made it easier for them to talk.

The resident staff is the utmost in efficiency. This is most evident when moving one president out and one president in.  The outgoing president has the House until noon on Inauguration Day and the new president will be back at the House at around five o'clock. In this amount of time, they will have moved out the old president and arranged everything of the new president's according to the president decorator if he has one and overseen by the social secretary.  The  Obamas would be the first to hire a man for the position of social secretary in 2011.

Other firsts include the first African-American Chief Usher which went to former Coast Guard Admiral Stephen Rochon in 2007.  In 2011, the position became another milestone when the first woman and second African-American held it.  The Chief Usher oversees all of the over 90 executive resident staff.  Each office has its own head, such as Head of Housekeeping, Maitre D' who is the Head Butler, Head Florist, Head Chef, plumber, electrician, painter, etc...  You don't apply to get a job at the White House. You get recommended by someone who works there.  There are generations of families who have worked there.

The staff lives to serve and become exacerbated when the First Families won't let them.  However, they understand and enjoyed when Chelsea wanted to learn how to clean and cook on her own and looked to them to teach her.  First Lady Michelle Obama insisted that Malia and Sasha make their own beds and do their own laundry and her mother wouldn't let them anywhere near her unmentionables so she did her own laundry too.

Basically, the George H.W. Bushs were looked upon the most favorably. They seemed to truly care about the staff as people--asking about their personal lives and insisting they go home at an early hour so they could spend time with their families.  Nancy Reagan made the Head of Housekeeping quit for a while because she couldn't handle her angry tirades and her strict perfectionism and nearly impossible requests.  The Clintons drove the Curator nuts because they kept moving furniture around and it has to be recorded at all times.  There were also some heavy fighting where there was blood on the sheets in the morning from when Hillary had clocked Bill with a book in the head.  Johnson had an obsession with the shower needing the pressure to be hard and the temperature to be hotter than hell. It caused one of the staff to be hospitalized due to a nervous breakdown he was having such a hard time making the shower just right for the president.  Pat Nixon didn't want the staff to look at them when they were in the room so they would have to turn their bodies away.

This book looks back at fifty years and ten presidents who came and went while the resident staff stayed on taking care of the House and its every changing occupant keeping their secrets.  Brower interviewed over a hundred resident workers, presidential aides, and first family members to write this wonderful and well-researched book.  I really loved this book and it's behind the scenes look at how the East Wing of the White House is run.  I found it touching how close the staff could sometimes be with the first family.  Doorman Preston Bruce was asked by Jacqueline Kennedy to be with the family at the funeral and graveside of John F. Kennedy.  Chief Usher West meant so much to her that she asked Nancy Reagan if he could be buried in Arlington and he was.  When James Ramsey, a favorite butler from the Carter administration to 2010 died in 2014 Laura Bush spoke at his funeral and letters from both Presidents Clinton and Obama were read aloud.

29361,4409,1800,"Man, this is a hard one. I don't like being overly critical, especially not when an author, artist, or anybody puts their heart into something. Their intentions were probably good. But I must be frank with the flaws in this book for the purpose of integrity. Some great worldbuilding and concepts was visible, and I enjoyed it, but wasn't terribly impressed with the execution. Or the ending, which was what led me to whittle this down to a lower score.

My rating for Elantris is:
5.5/10

Pros:
- What a great magic system. Even in his earlier writing days, Brandon is beyond ingenuitive with his concepts, I'll give him that at the least
- The grit. Whoa. So much grime. He really nails the ""living like a sewer rat"" to the absolute head, and props to this as well. He doesn't overexaggerate or emphasize the use of gore and grit to shock, rather to convey the message that Elantris is a DIRTY place.
- Prince Raoden isn't the best protagonist (sometimes unrealistic do-gooder) but is refreshingly simple and generous at times. And his voice for the protagonist definitely met expectations, if not superceded them.

Cons:
- Weak side characters. I know there are some great ones (Galladon definitely should receive an honorable mention here). But none of them really seem to affect much of what is happening outside of the protagonist's grasp, except perhaps Hrathen or Sarene.
- Sarene. This goes beyond just Elantris but I am not quite fond of Sanderson's depiction of women in his novels, least what I have read. They're either incredibly reasonable and apathetic, or they're just unbelievably naivete. It's like something out of an anime, and Sarene was no exception. I'll go more in depth with my review of ""The Way of Kings"", but there were times when I just really couldn't get immersed with her involved. For an exceptionally clever girl, she acted incredibly dumb just to serve as a plot device.
- The ending. This is perhaps why I immediately put the book down and had to have it out with a nearby pillow. It was perhaps, the only book I have ever read that not only rips the rug beneath your feet as a reveal, but does it MULTIPLE times in a few pages. Perhaps (since this was months ago) that I am selectively forgetting the hints along the way, but it really made me feel cheated.

In no way did I hate the book. I did in fact, enjoy it enough to pick up Mistborn and Way of Kings immediately afterwards. And I must credit that this was Sanderson's first book, and therefore deserves appreciation for the effort put into creating it. Though I'm struggling to get through his more recent novels currently, I think his potential (which is certainly seen in Elantris) is what many folks are hanging on for. Overall, not a bad read if you're looking to burn some time.",1520812800,3,man hard one dont like overli critic especi author artist anybodi put heart someth intent probabl good must frank flaw book purpos integr great worldbuild concept visibl enjoy wasnt terribl impress execut end led whittl lower score rate elantri 5510 pro great magic system even earlier write day brandon beyond ingenuit concept ill give least grit whoa much grime realli nail live like sewer rat absolut head prop well doesnt overexagger emphas use gore grit shock rather convey messag elantri dirti place princ raoden isnt best protagonist sometim unrealist dogood refreshingli simpl gener time voic protagonist definit met expect superced con weak side charact know great one galladon definit receiv honor mention none realli seem affect much happen outsid protagonist grasp except perhap hrathen saren saren goe beyond elantri quit fond sanderson depict woman novel least read theyr either incred reason apathet theyr unbeliev naivet like someth anim saren except ill go depth review way king time

29365,507,2576,"Debut Author Karen Clevelands new spy thriller comes from a heartfelt place. She wrote it while on maternity leave from her former position as a CIA analyst, and it is steeped with both internal agency politics and maternal concern.
First-person narrator Vivian Miller has developed an algorithm to help identify the Russian sleeper cells the CIA is convinced are hiding in the United States. Finding a cells handlerthe only person who knows the agents identitiesis  is an essential first step to unmasking the entire group.
Using her algorithm, shes eliminated all but one of her handler candidates and is so close to cracking into the computer of the last onea man named Yury Yakovthat she doesnt mind the long working hours. Well, she does mind. She has a loving husband, Matt, and four kids at home, including toddler twins, one of whom has a serious heart defect. Fortunately, Matt works from home, and pitches in when she cant pick up the kids or make the lunches or take Caleb to his doctor appointments. He also cooks.
In a breakthrough moment early in the book, Vivian finally worms her way into Yurys computer, and, in a folder labeled friends, finds photographs of the sleeper agents in Yurys cell. Four are strangers. The fifth is a shocking discoveryher husband Matt. From there on she must try to sort out the lies and deception from the true core of what she thought was a healthy, loving relationship. She really does need to know.
Throughout the story, she believes in him, then she doesnt, then she does, and her waffling on this question may be realistic, or merely convenient, for her and the plot. Vivians uppermost concern is the safety of her children, especially as Yury circles nearer. Perhaps Cleveland occasionally overdoes Vivians mounting anxiety, but you can understand the confusion she is thrown into and how she naturally does return again and again to her touchstone: keeping the kids safe when she cannot trust anyone.
The tension is definitely there in this thriller, ratcheting up with each action Vivian doesor does nottake. The most engaging part of the story is her relationship with Matt, as each new event causes her to reevaluate everything that has gone on before and whether she can ever trust him againa plot question I found rather easier to answer than Vivian did.

29368,890,2769,"A woman with a drinking problem sees something she shouldn't have and no one believes her, but she just has to get to the bottom of it. Stop me if you've heard this one before. Admittedly, I wasn't ecstatic about reading this book. The plot didn't grab me - I thought it sounded too similar to ""The Girl on a Train"" - and yes, it had ""woman"" in the title. There are too many books out there with ""woman"" or ""girl"" in the title for me, all with similar plot lines.

In ""The Woman in the Window,"" Anna Fox is a child psychologist turned recluse after a traumatic event involving her husband and young daughter about ten months ago. She spends her days indoors, spying on her neighbors, taking photos of them, and watching old noir thrillers. Her days also consist of mixing prescription pills with copious amounts of wine, something I found tiresome after a while. It was mentioned one or two times on every page, and I didn't need the repetition.

One day, the Russell's move in next door. Alistair and Jane Russell with Ethan, their teenage son. To the outside, they look like a picturesque family. One evening, as Anna watches them, she sees something she is not meant to see, setting off a chain of events? Did she really see what she thought she did? Or was it a figment of her imagination?

It took me a while to get into this book. I kept powering through because everyone I know insisted that it was a great read. I feel like it wasn't until page 300 that I became to feel invested in it. I didn't feel much for the characters and Anna was, well, she was annoying.

29369,3287,356,"I love historical fiction. Its one of my favorite genres. It has been ever since the eighth grade, when my history teacher gave me a book about Dolly Madison. This was an interesting book. Its told from the perspective of Thomas Jeffersons oldest daughter. I debated a lot about the number of stars I think probably I shouldve been somewhere between three and four stars but in the end I gave it the benefit of the doubt and gave the full four.  It took me a while to finish this book because it was so much going on.  This book made it seem like Thomas Jefferson was actually fairly frail person mentally after the death of his wife, which is a little hard for me to swallow considering all the wonderful things that he actually did after that point. In this book, basically his daughter was involved in every significant decision that he ever made, and I think that that is a stretch at best But then I guess thats where the fiction part comes in. If you finish the book and read the notes at the end it you can clearly see that its fairly accurate historically in the various timelines, its always the conversations and how decisions were made is where the fiction part happens. I think I am just a little disappointed that Jefferson was not a stronger character in this book, which actually may be true...I just don't know. But the book did remind me of some of the incredible things that were going on during this time period, and the people involved and how they interacted.  I think now I will have to read the actual Thomas Jefferson biography and make up my mind from there.

29371,31,997,"Ash is convinced no woman will ever want him or love him, who wants to be intimate with a monster? He has convinced himself that his physical scars will repulse everyone, especially any potential love interests. Emma sees the man behind the horrific scars and finds herself falling for the stubborn aristocrat.
Emotional attachment isn't part of the deal though. Not according to the deal the two of them have agreed to. It includes an heir to the dukedom, a lot of teasing, and definitely under no circumstances shall there be any kissing. Not an easy task when you're in the throes of passion.
The Duchess Deal has an equal amount of passion and playfulness, including a house full of scheming staff invested in Emma and Ash, and their very peculiar relationship. At the same time the read is hotter than a chilli pepper. An excellent balancing act of charm, wit and desire.

Lovers of Regency romances want to experience the moments of illicit passion, the moments when there is a sharp intake of a breath just before the feisty beautiful woman is kissed passionately by the debonair gentleman. There are some authors who also manage to infuse the wicked and the saucy with a sense of humour, and that is the core essence of a standout Regency novel. Tessa Dare certainly knows how to combine the hot and heavy horizontal tango with a quick witted humorous dialogue.
Instead of relying on all of the usual clichs and the sometimes stuffy repertoire of this genre, the author has fun with the characters and the plot. This sense of adventure and joie de vivre can be felt throughout the book. Tessa Dare elicits amused snorts and accelerated heartbeats in equal measure.

29380,723,3655,"Lisa Gardner never disapoints. I love D.D. Warren, who investigates the murder of a family of five-shot in cold blood, while the sixteen year old daughter disappears with the family dogs. Did Roxy kill her whole family after they had only just been reunited, after being separated because fo their mother's alcoholism? The tension never lets up as Gardner gives us reason to believe all the characters might have done it--while giving enough clues to make it obvious when she finally reveals the killer.
Lisa Gardner is a great researcher which makes me shutter when her characters become wards of the state and are placed in a foster home that is too horrible to believe. I hope this opens the eyes of those in charge of such institutions which is what good fiction has to ability to do, and I'm glad Gardner is giving us a peek into that that world--though she does it without blame, or preaching--all the while giving us a great story to get lost in.

29381,412,1233,"The title and epigraph for Maggie OFarrells memoir is from Sylvia Plaths THE BELL JAR: I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart: I am. I am. I am. OFarrell embraces Plaths confidence, real or imagined, as she recounts 16 moments in her life when she escaped death. Daughter (The Present Day), the 17th and final story, is part miracle and part agony, in the description of her daughters birth and then the disfiguring eczema that enveloped the baby. Her accounts are deeply personal, and she creates an exquisitely detailed picture of the strong, vibrant leading woman she is today, along with the many supporting members of the cast.

OFarrells descriptions of the pain she felt when she first contracted encephalitis at age eight are fierce and original: so severe, so pure, that it was as if someone was sounding a high soprano chord somewhere behind my eyes. my skull was a balloon overfilled with water. This is the next-to-last piece in the memoir, and she explains that the time she spent in the hospital is the hinge on which my childhood swung. She was one child before and quite another afterward. She overheard a nurse explaining in a too-loud voice outside her room that she was the little girl who was dying, and she recounts those moments in one of her novels. She learned to listen, as well as read the looks among the adults peering at her --- over her bed, beside her in the car, at dinner tables.

Almost all of the chapters are titled by part of the anatomy, including Lungs and Circulatory System. However, the first piece, Neck, is not really about OFarrells neck; it is about the violence she feels in a fellow traveler on an isolated path. She senses the planning that is occurring in the mans mind as he glances at her legs and arms. She is surprised by the familiar act of his putting the strap of his binoculars around her neck, but then he shows her the ducks on the pond. She chatters her way away. However, she reports him to the local police who hold their laughter but not their disdain: Sounds terrifying. Terrible. She is unhappily vindicated about the dangers of this man after a few weeks. Years later, she makes an unspoken promise to her young daughter that she will find the words to tell her that some people want to hurt her.

OFarrell identifies some saviors, seraphs in disguise, who remain unnamed, but who stand on the periphery of her life, generally in hospital rooms, but in waiting rooms and airports as well. She senses rather than knows that she has been protected. In the case of one television personality who visited her when she was very small, she learns years later that the celebritys visits were not innocent. He was a predator, but one of the nurses who kept her hair in a tidy brown bun stayed her watch and did not leave when he asked her. She was the knight in a white dress and hat.

Abdomen chronicles the botched C-section of her first baby and how the arrogance of Mr. C nearly killed her. Intestines is a gripping story of an incredibly resilient parasite she contracted in China, and how her cache of American dollars moved her to the head of the line for care. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, the care was medication usually prescribed for horses. She survived.

OFarrell explains to an early boyfriend why she does what she does --- what happened to her as a child --- and he parroted what most people do: You were so unlucky. She surprises him. Not true. She did not die, she writes and walks and swims, she is wheelchair-free, she attended normal public schools. The limitations that might have been her life are replaced by glowing independence, endurance and creativity. She has found a crock of gold at every rainbows end.

29383,3116,626,"Ive just finished reading this, and feel as though Ive just emerged from the past with two extraordinary women as guides. Although it is fiction, it is based on extensive research, including over three thousand letters, so I felt confident that the relationship between these two prominent women, Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok, was well portrayed.  Most of the major events of this time are well documented, so I allowed myself to more fully accept that what I was reading was mostly accurate, and happily immersed myself in this era, the 1930s until the 1960s.
Lorena Hickok, aka Hick, was a prominent journalist. At that time, being  a woman in this field, especially a highly successful one, required being a very tough cookie, and Hick was definitely that, and more. Described through her eyes, this tumultuous time in history, as well as her deep love and devotion to Eleanor Roosevelt, is fascinating. Her voice is quirky and spunky, which added to my enjoyment of the book. I found myself smiling often at her clever and insightful words.
While covering the beginnings of FDRs presidency for the Associated Press, Hick met Eleanor Roosevelt and began a friendship that grew into a lifelong love between them. This love eventually became romantic and they became inseparable, with Hick even living at the White House for a time. Because of FDRs continuous philandering, Eleanor was lonely and heartbroken, and readily embraced this relationship. FDRs was aware of the sexual nature of their relationship, and was content that his wife was finding a source of happiness elsewhere, while he spent time with his various mistresses. The sexuality is understated, tasteful, and very much an expression of their deep love. They remained devoted to each other for decades, until the end of Eleanors life.
Homosexuality being scandalous,and a serious crime at the time, great care was taken by those who knew of their secret romance to keep it secret. If this had become public knowledge, of course, the Roosevelt presidency,which lasted 12 years, would have been imperiled and many of the social protections we take for granted today might not have been enacted: Social Security, child labor laws, the forty-hour work week, Workers Compensation, disability insurance, and many others.
Hicks description of the time they had together is searingly honest and straightforward. Words like heartfelt, bittersweet, and poignant come to mind. It is a beautifully written love story of an deep and lasting relationship between two extraordinary women.
I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy well researched historical fiction with a heart.

29386,4378,1153,"Have you ever had to go to school everyday knowing there will always be someone staring at you or judging you? Well, Auggie Pullman had this experience. Auggie Pullman is a 10 year old boy who was born with a facial deformity. Therefore, because of all his surgeries, he has been home schooled up until fifth grade, but is going to a real school at Beecher Prep for the first time. He has trouble making friends, but luckily he makes some good ones along the way. He bravely faces bullying, mean notes, name calling, and other rude things.

The main characters who surround Auggie are Jack, Summer, Julian, Charlotte, Christopher, and Mr. Tushman.

The message of the book is to choose kind, which means to always be nice to people. This book teaches you that not only should you be kind to others, but you should never judge people by their appearance.

This is an outstanding book because it shows me how to choose kindness. I definitely recommend this book because it is heartwarming, sad, and happy all at the same time. This book is different from Wonder because it tells the story from other peoples perspectives. It tells more about the three narrators. The narrators are Julian, Pluto, and Shinaling. You will find out who each person is and what they have to do with Auggie. If you want to read about Auggies journey through middle school, then you should read this book.

29390,4378,2733,"REFUGEE is a great book for readers who like suspense, mysteries, and surprises. In REFUGEE, each chapter leaves off with twist. Then when you read the next chapter all your questions are answered. In the book, Josef, a Jewish boy living in 1930's Nazi Germany who is taking the journey to America with his sister Ruthie, and his mom, and dad. Isabel a Cuban girl in 1944, is going on a journey to Florida with her grandfather, father, mother, and her little brother, which is on the way, but shes also going on the journey with her best friend Ivan his mom and dad, his older brother, and his brothers girlfriend. Mahmoud, a Syrian boy in 2015 is taking his journey to Germany with his brother Waleed, his sister Hana, and his mom and dad. While reading this book, you can experience many feelings, such as sadness, happiness, and suspense for not knowing what could happen next to the characters. REFUGEE is a great book for anyone. I recommend this book for everyone who love to learn about events in history. I think this because while reading this book I was able to learn about things in the world that I didn't even know happened. The theme of the this story is that patience is key. For the three stories in REFUGEE each character has to wait before going to a land where they're free, and can enjoy the simple things in life without getting in trouble. The authors word play made me feel like I was sailing across the Gulf of Mexico, going on a long journey to Florida, traveling across the vast Atlantic ocean to get to America, and traveling across hot and dry deserts to get to Germany.

I think you should read this book if you are interested in WWII. It's all about how life was during the late 1930's and the early 1940's. It also goes deeply into how and why families were being torn apart by people getting put in concentration camps. All these kids were young. They also didn't have many friends. The story was based on how kids had to work harder and when they get older they get sent to a concentration camp. The kids go through many hardships with school and how Hitler is taking over. The Nazis are killing Jews and showing no mercy. However, it doesnt go in depth with informing you about what happened in the war. Its more focused on what the families were feeling during it. How mothers were left without some children and husbands. If you're a fan of the war and don't want it to be too violent Refugee is for you.

Wow! This was definitely an eye opening read. Not only was it very interesting, poignant and moving, it was based on a real tragedy. I had absolutely no idea that ""comfort women"" had existed. Estimates of over 200,000 women were kidnapped from their homes & families and brought to brothels where they were brutalized, humiliated and made to service soldiers. Sometimes, 15 to 20 men a day. Estimates are many of these women were never seen again.

My heart ached for Hana and Emiko. The atrocities they suffered were severe and totally animal like.

The author did a great job in portraying these women. I enjoyed my time with them, meanwhile, my heart going out to them.

A beautifully written story about a horrible, horrible atrocity.

29396,1216,1233,"Maggie O'Farrell is lucky to be alive. In her latest book, a memoir this time, she shares with us seventeen brushes with death and her thoughts and feelings having survived a multitude of illnesses and close calls. A novelist best known for books like This Must Be the Place and Instructions for a Heatwave, O'Farrell's gift for words is obvious in her non-fiction as well as her novels.

I Am, I Am, I Am is a life story in vignettes, from her teenaged self diving into too-deep waters to her childhood struggle with encephalitis that let her with long lasting neurological issues. There are narrow escapes from a threatening robber and budding serial killer as well as heart-breaking problems with pregnancy and childbirth. The chapters take us back and forth through time, to feel her pain and frustration at loss, her hope and joyous celebration at survival, and the lessons she learns throughout.

With more than a dash of stories from her world travels, a bit of her struggles as a young writer, more than a couple stories of the hair-pulling frustration and elation of parenting, and the heartbreak of relationships, O'Farrell shares some of her most intimate memorieswith a searing honesty and self-aware irony that keeps her grounded.

Personally. I love Maggie O'Farrell's novels, and I loved this book as well. While the chapters weren't always easy to read--some were downright harrowing--I felt like I got to spend time listening to a good and trusted friend talk about life. It's tough to read, and keep those tissues at hand for some chapters, but I do not regret a single moment I spent with this book.

I started this by saying that Maggie O'Farrell is lucky to be alive, but the truth is, we are all lucky that Maggie O'Farrell is alive, and doubly so that she is writing. And so I read, I read, I read.

29397,1004,3126,"Thank you to Viking for generously supplying me with a review copy of How to Stop Time by Matt Haig. I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.

How to Stop Time spans the ages, literally because Tom Hazard was born centuries ago. Don't think vampire or time traveler but rather a rare case of growing old at an extremely slow rate. Due to Tom's regressed aging, those around him become very suspicious of the boy who never grows older. After a tragic event, Tom escapes his home and attempts to rebuild his life in London. He hopes that by choosing the bustling city of London during the time of Shakespeare he can stay under the radar and blend in. This book is told from Tom's perspective as he restarts his life in Shakespearian London and present-day London. Tom must start his life over again every eight years because that is the amount of time that the organization that protects him has deemed is the right amount for someone with his condition. Before Tom can move onto his new life he is given a job by the Albatross Society that he must complete before he can enter his new life with papers and money to live on. As Tom tries to figure out his new life in present-day London he needs to make some huge decisions about what his very long future will look like. Should he continue on a path that makes him miserable or begins making choices in his life that could leave him in the hands of the wrong people?

I enjoyed How to Stop Time, but was left feeling a bit disappointed by a few major things that happened in the book. I was honestly jumping into this book hoping for more of a love story, and that section of the book came up lacking to me. I got frustrated with Tom and his inability to ask questions and attempt to figure out some things on his own because I definitely knew a few things that he was too naive to notice. Matt Haig definitely has a way with words though, and I loved sitting with my highlighter and journal as I read this book.

Here are a few of my favorite quotes in the book-

""The first rule is that you don't fall in love,' he said....'There are other rules too, but that is the main one. No falling in love.""

""You can love the sight of waterfalls and the smell of old books, but the love of people is off limits."" page 1

""Humans beings, as a rule, simply don't accept things that don't fit their worldview"" Page 7

""One thing that has remained constant across four centuries has been the desire for a British person to fill a silence with talk of weather, and whenever I have lived there I was no exception to this rule"" page 34

""If you live long enough you realize that every proven fact is later disproved and then proven again."" page 37

This book was a very easy read and might make a good choice to pick up in between heavier reads.  I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy the writing style of Deborah Harkness.",1520812800,2,thank vike gener suppli review copi stop time matt haig receiv book free exchang honest review thought opinion stop time span age liter tom hazard born centuri ago dont think vampir time travel rather rare case grow old extrem slow rate due tom regress age around becom suspici boy never grow older tragic event tom escap home attempt rebuild life london hope choos bustl citi london time shakespear stay radar blend book told tom perspect restart life shakespearian london presentday london tom must start life everi eight year amount time organ protect deem right amount someon condit tom move onto new life given job albatross societi must complet enter new life paper money live tom tri figur new life presentday london need make huge decis long futur look like continu path make miser begin make choic life could leav hand wrong peopl enjoy stop time left feel bit disappoint major thing happen book honestli
29398,412,3126,"Matt Haig is a flat-out wonderful writer. I fell in love with his intelligent and humorous novel, THE HUMANS, a few years ago. His latest release isn't so much a novel as it is an experience. It is slotted amidst the Fiction bestsellers but easily could be filed under Fantasy, Science Fiction and, yes, even Romance. Its early in the year, but HOW TO STOP TIME most definitely will be near the top of my Best of 2018 list.

I love books about time travel; Dr. Who is one of my all-time favorite TV shows. Vampire novels are also a draw for me. However, it wasn't until Anne Rice brought us her own unique take on vampires that we recognized the downside of being immortal. Its the simple fact that not only do you never die, but everyone you ever meet will die before you. This makes it difficult to strike up any meaningful friendships --- and it makes falling in love all but out of the question.

These are the themes that Haig focuses on in HOW TO STOP TIME. Tom Hazard --- the name the lead character is going by in the present --- has a rare condition called anageria, which makes it nearly impossible for him to die. He also ages at an extremely slow rate, so it isn't easy for him to settle in one place for periods of time. Any longer than, say, eight years and people might begin to notice the lack of wrinkles or gray hairs --- beyond what you can purchase at the corner drugstore to make yourself look younger.

Tom is not a time traveler in that he cannot jump from one age to another. However, he does travel through time merely by existing for several centuries and seeing history up close. This is why his latest guise, as a history teacher, is the perfect ruse for someone with firsthand knowledge of the people and places he is telling his students about. Tom was born on the third of March in the year 1581. His mother did not have the same condition as he did. During a time when having anything different about you could get you killed, this meant that she was taken and drowned before young Tom's eyes since the ignorant townspeople thought she was a witch.

It took a few centuries, but Tom finally found a way to live safely. A man named Hendrich has formed an international society that works to create new bios and safe careers for people with Tom's affliction. The only conditions are that he must keep changing his name and location of his home base every eight years to avoid suspicion. Also, and most importantly, he must never fall in love.

Tom enjoys his new role as a history teacher at the Oakfield School in London. The only problem is that the young French teacher is showing more than a passing interest in Tom. Camille also catches Tom's fancy, and he begins to experience feelings he swore never to have again. Especially after he lost his one and only wife, Rose, many years earlier. The other sore spot for Tom is that he and the only woman he would call his wife had a child --- a young girl named Marion. She was born with the same affliction as her father, and he has been trying to find her for what seems like ages.

Tom has to be lectured by Hendrich and other handlers that the world has changed and now has many ways to find him out. The witch hunts may be over, but in their place are scientists --- the new witchfinders. Hendrich doesn't want Tom going off looking for his daughter because it might reveal what they really are and threaten to expose all of their kind. Tom has to keep his plight private, just as he must hide his burgeoning feelings for Camille.

HOW TO STOP TIME takes us back and forth across the ages, and it is spectacular to watch Tom as he is employed by a young William Shakespeare to be one of the musicians working at his new Globe Theatre. We also get to see Tom interact with F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, and shrewd readers will love the impact he has on Fitzgerald's writing.

The problem is that Camille is no fool, and Tom sometimes gets paranoid around her as if she might be on to him. One night, during a dinner date, Camille confesses that she fell in love with a famous picture of the great nightclub jazz singer, Josephine Baker. She was always drawn to the young man playing the piano for Baker in that photo, and he bears a striking resemblance to Tom.

HOW TO STOP TIME is full of pitfalls, suspense and wonder at every turn. I literally wished I could stop time to keep this fantastic story from ending. Highly recommended as a novel that defies description and characterization, and is impossibly addictive in the process.

29399,1331,656,"I absolutely loved this book, and quite literally couldn't put it down. I loved the concept of Mercy being different than a werewolf, which put her outside of normal werewolf laws...and the pack leaders who enforce them. The mystery was fantastic, and the plot never drug once. This really is a urban fantasy first, and a romance second, and I guess that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because first off, I really struggle extensively with love triangles, and second, because the romance really does move SO slow. It took all the way to the end before I'd even guessed which direction it was going to go, and even then wasn't sure.

I definitely hate insta-loves, don't get me wrong. I guess I'm usually just a sucker for love/hate or hate/hate ""relationships"" that may or may not sizzle. So 4 stars for me specifically, and 5 stars for the author's skill.

29400,3441,3080,"This was a bit of a roller-coaster rating wise. It started as a 2, took a steep nosedive into a 1, but the last half of the book pulled it together to round it out to a decent 3. I enjoyed the last half of the book enough that I'm willing to round it all up to a 3.

This book reminds me of when TV shows try to mess with the formula (think The Office when Michael quits to start up a rival paper company). They go way off in left field, ultimately destroying every that was likable about the series, and then decide to back to the original formula, basically ignoring that the flub ever happened. The last couple books in the series have been the New Coke fiasco of the Dresden Files. Okay, so I'm mixing metaphors, but the point is that this book is right back to the original formula again.

Sure, Harry is still struggling with the whole ""I'm the Winter Knight monster!"" thing. Over and over and over and over. Even his internal battle with Lasciel didn't take this much whining and inner angst and that was a freakin' Fallen Angel in his head. But mostly, it's back to normal in almost every other aspect of the plot.

So, it was okay. There are some dumb things in the book and some good things.

I'm a little tired of the characters being painted as selfless heroes when they're willing to do bad things to save the people they love. Call me crazy, but just because you're doing something for good reasons doesn't justify doing something bad...I think there's a quote out there somewhere about that. ;)  But several of the ""heroes"" (I'm looking at you Dresden and Karrin) are willing to fight tooth and nail to save everyone, but the minute someone they really love is in trouble, they will throw out all their morals and values and do anything to save that person. Dresden even admits that though a lot of innocent people were killed by his stunt with the Red Court, he doesn't care because his daughter was in trouble. Sure, you can argue that killing off the Court saved a lot of lives, but that's not what Dresden cares about. His daughter was in trouble, so he didn't care who he had to hurt or kill everyone to save her. Not heroic. At all. Of course, those people he didn't slit their throat, so it's not a big deal. He's still crying about his hand in Susan's death, but all the other faceless people he killed indirectly don't matter. Yay for moral fluidity!

However, there is something about the series that has kept me going through it. I don't usually power through a bunch of 3-star books, but Butcher has managed to put together a cast of characters that were interesting enough to keep my curiosity peaked about what comes next. I wanted to see where things were headed for the characters. That said, I am not dying for the next book and probably won't bother picking it up when it finally comes out. I will put this book down, delete the series from my Kindle, and will likely never think about it again.

It's not a bad series, but I do not understand the massive cult-like appeal for a lot of people. The plots are formulaic. The writing is fine, but not stand out other than the narrator's voice is engaging. The main character has no personal development. At all. As far as I can tell, he's the same character as he was in the 1st book. Sure, he's learned some cool new tricks, but he doesn't seem to change at all. Unless you count getting moodier. The side characters get some personal development, but for most of them it's not for the better.

Overall, a 3 star series. I'm not sad I read the books. I'm glad I gave them a chance and stuck with it (though it was hit and miss at times), but I probably won't read any of the future books when they eventually come out.",1520812800,3,bit rollercoast rate wise start 2 took steep nosed 1 last half book pull togeth round decent 3 enjoy last half book enough im will round 3 book remind tv show tri mess formula think offic michael quit start rival paper compani go way left field ultim destroy everi likabl seri decid back origin formula basic ignor flub ever happen last coupl book seri new coke fiasco dresden file okay im mix metaphor point book right back origin formula sure harri still struggl whole im winter knight monster thing even intern battl lasciel didnt take much whine inner angst freakin fallen angel head mostli back normal almost everi aspect plot okay dumb thing book good thing im littl tire charact paint selfless hero theyr will bad thing save peopl love call crazi your someth good reason doesnt justifi someth badi think there quot somewher sever hero im look dresden karrin will fight tooth nail
29401,4885,3840,"My thoughts on BURN BRIGHT in ten points:

1. I love Anna and Charles so much. Their bond makes me so happy. And I love seeing them work together through this series.

2. I swooned every time Brother Wolf told Charles that Anna was made for them.

3. Despite the intensity of the mystery, I laughed several times while reading this book, and all the small character and relational moments make this series for me.

4. I enjoyed spending this book back in Aspen Creek with the pack.

5. I did not guess the traitor.

6. I ended this book feeling more positive towards Leah than I ever felt possible.

7. I also love Asil. He is an interesting mix of charming and caring and brutal.

8. The second half got a little bogged down for me in some backstories. Though ultimately they all made sense and were important.

9. Still, I was completely into this story and kept wanting to get back to it.

10. I generally fatigue reading a series around 5 books or so, but I'm pretty sure I could read about Anna and Charles forever.

>I am an independent reviewer. This book is the 1st book in the Torpedo Ink series and ends in an HEA. Eighteen survivors from a horrific school in Russia come to America and form a family, an MC. A lot of these survivors have paranormal tendencies, honed since birth. Torpedo Ink uses their skill as trained assassins, along with their paranormal skills to track down anyone hurting women or children. They are the ultimate gang of rogues who will do anything to save the helpless.
>Reaper has been especially abused. He fights an attraction to the new bartender. He is afraid he may accidentally kill her if he lets go around her. The relationship between Reaper and Anya seems so real. She sees his need for therapy and how limited his options are and attempts to help him any way she can. The MC was raised together and tortured together. They have skewed real world reasoning skills, but try their best.
>The scene with Reaper and Tawny almost brought tears to my eyes. Anya suffers from the poor decision making of the MC, yet loves Reaper so much, she sticks with them. This book is appropriate for an adult audience. I am giving this story 5 stars. There are a lot of triggers in this story, but they are needed to show the extreme abuse the Russians had to survive.

29416,113,20,"Set in affluent Shaker Heights, Ohio before the millennium, Little Fires Everywhere is Celeste Ng doing what she does best.  Like her wonderful debut book Everything I Never Told You, Little Fires is a deep dive into family relationships, suburban racism, family expectations, and difficult choices.  Each book starts with a catastrophic event.

The Richardson family seems perfect on the outside.  Dad is an attorney and mom is a journalist for the local paper.  They have four children, perfectly spaced apart, and all in high school.  Lexie is a senior; pretty, smart and Yale bound.  Trip is a junior and is the athletic one.  Moody is smart but geeky while Izzy is a hot mess and always in trouble.  Mrs. Richardson rents out a duplex to Mia and Pearl who are new to town.  Mia is an artist, as unconventional and vagabond as Mrs. Richardson is proper and rigid.  Pearl is Mias daughter who is sweet and smart, but has never bothered to make friends or a good impression as they move frequently.  Mia promises Pearl that Shaker Heights will be their home.  Pearl is essentially adopted by the Richardsons, who she envies for their easy wealth and welcoming ways.  Mia ends up adopting Izzy and later Lexie, as she offers the girls things that their mother cannot.  Another affluent family, good friends of the Richardsons, are in the process of adopting a Chinese baby who was abandoned at a fire station.  Mia immediately knows who gave birth to the baby and sets in motion a chain of events that upends the town.  Mrs. Richardson, in retaliation, digs into Mias complicated past and things spiral more out of control.

This is an excellent story that will leave you with a lot to think about.  It is a great pick for book clubs, as it is for my book club this month.  There are the issues of what defines a family and of race and culture.  There are characters you will root for and root against, though which is which will depend on your perspective.  I gave this four stars because I thought that the book really dragged in places.  I typically enjoy reading a characters backstory, but some of it was just too much.  This was particularly true of Mias backstory.  I also did not care for the ending.  After so much build up, the ending was very vague with no questions answered.  And this criticism is from a woman who hates neat and tidy happily ever afters!

The black and whites, the police dressed in protective garb, along with Milo asking questions of the family members - the victim had been brutalised and the initial thought was what a struggle it would be to identify the man.

As days turned into a week, then two and the answers were still a long way off, Milo and Alex persevered. The strangeness of the case, the twisted and emotionless family they encountered - would they solve this one? Or would it drift into an unsolved case; a cold case?

29429,412,3869,"At the opening of his new novel, CENSUS, Jesse Ball includes an authors note that immediately raises the stakes of the narrative that follows. He dedicates the book to his older brother Adam, who, he recounts, had Down syndrome and died in his mid-20s. Ball writes of his tangled memories of his brother, and of his childhood conviction that he would some day be responsible for his older brother, even though the burden of that responsibility never truly came to fruition. Continuing to imagine that now-impossible future, Ball writes, was the genesis of CENSUS.

The books unnamed narrator is an older man, a widower and successful surgeon whose professional colleague breaks the news that he has a terminal heart condition. Knowing that his time is finite, the narrator quits his job and instead signs on as a census taker, driving north with his developmentally disabled son through a series of towns named after letters and arranged alphabetically. When he reaches Z, the narrator knows his life will be over, and he has arranged for his son to travel back south, to be cared for by a family friend now that both of his parents are deceased.

The towns and landscapes through which the narrator and his son drive in their aged car are dramatic and, at times, hostile. One town boasts a huge rope factory whose workers suffer multiple serious accidents --- sometimes fatal --- daily. Another has been shuttered following a mine disaster. Between towns are marshes and mountains, forests and fields --- strange and sparsely populated territory studded with these small and sometimes unfriendly settlements.

The census itself bears little resemblance to the standard questionnaires with which we might be familiar. Its purpose is unclear, and the census taker is required to tattoo or brand every inhabitant as a way of marking their participation, their very existence. Some, as you might imagine, are fearful or reluctant, while others greet the narrator and his son with hospitality.

As for the census taker, he views his new profession as an opportunity to practice the kind of awareness and observation that was a hallmark of his late wifes personality. She was a performance artist, an unconventional kind of clown, trained at an equally unconventional school --- and upon the birth of their unconventional son, she made it her lifes work to make his life as bearable, as meaningful, even as joyful as possible. I here and now give you permission to live an examined life, the census trainer tells the narrator about the importance of the work he undertakes, beginning now with this moment in which I ask you a question and you, poor soul, may examine your life in the light that it sheds.

CENSUS is a book that resists easy categorization. Its dramatic design and modern, sparse layout seem, at times, at odds with the almost fable- or fairy tale-like quality of its prose. But, in the end, the novel transcends both, becoming an elegiac yet ultimately hopeful story about a mans intentions for his final days and about his wishes and dreams for his son following his death. The sons limitations, the cruelties with which the world has at times pummeled him, make this narrative even more poignant than it would be otherwise. But even though these particulars (heightened by Balls opening story and the family photographs that are included at the end of the book) intensify the emotion, in the end the story told here is a universal one --- about parents and children and families, and finding ones purpose in the wide, at times unforgiving or uncaring world.

My wife and I always spoke of making a trip together to show our son the country, but it never came. For one reason or another, it never came, and so I felt when my wife passed, when the idea rose in me about the census, I felt finally it was time to take out the Stafford, to drive the roads north. In her death, I felt a sure beginning of my own end  I felt I could certainly not last much longer, and so, as life is vested in variety, so we, my son, myself, we had to prolong what life we had by seeing every last thing we could put our eyes upon.

Census is the seventh novel by American poet and author, Jesse Ball. In his introduction, he explains the dedication to his older brother, Abram Ball, who had Down syndrome and died, aged twenty-four, in 1998. The surgeon and his son travel north in their (unnamed) country from City A to the town of Z in their Stafford Carriagecar, taking the Census.

In that role, they meet a large number of people, many of whom are welcoming and hospitable, whilst some others are quite the opposite. The surgeon asks his questions and hears many stories, some first-hand, others more removed. Most are kind to his son but: It is easy for humans to be cruel, and they leap t it. They love to do it. It is an exercise of all their laughable powers.

The father notes that his sons behaviour is not always easily explicable, but I have never sought to change what is essentially to my eyes, a basic resourcefulness that finds at any moment something profound. My wife was of the same opinion, but surely we did suffer for it. The long apologies we would have to give to the legions of helpers. But strangely, no one was ever angry about it. People became fond of him very quickly, and that has always helped.

A couple with a now-deceased Down syndrome daughter told him: There is a kind of understanding that can grow in a place, and then everyone, every last person can be a sort of protector for them. This is a thing she can confer on others  a kind of momentary vocation, and that is a real gift Some people were cruel to her, but here, something grew. It was a fine place for her to live, and when she died, she was missed

There are no quotation marks for speech, which may annoy some readers, although any speech is usually apparent from the context. Similarly, for almost three quarters of the book, characters are not given names, and are distinguished only by descriptors: my wife, my son, a boy, the man, the doctor, an old man. In a way, it reflects on the anonymity of the census and is partly explained by the fathers musings on our desire to name things.

Where Ball has the father saying we felt lucky to have had him, and lucky to become the ones who were continually with him, caring for him it could not be clearer that this is what he and his family felt for his brother.

29433,1234,3826,"Love the title tie-in to this story. It can be spun in so many different ways -- all of them connecting in a profound way as characters discover the meaning of self-worth and sacrifice. Shelley Shepard Gray knows how to create a page-turning read. This time it is delivered in a delicious suspense/Amish blend and I do so love that combination!

Calvin is so...burdened. He has fought his way up from the devastating results of a tragic childhood but he feels like he's lost himself somewhere along the way. He doesn't know how to be anyone but the undercover gang member he portrays. Until Alice.

Smothered by family love, Alice has lived a sheltered life, despite a challenging rumspringa. She's all sweetness and light with a surprising flash of fire and grit. Cal's intrigued. So is Alice. He reminds her of her rebellious teen years though she thought that she buried that part of her after a fateful night when she was seventeen. But, somehow, she can't help being drawn to the complicated ex-Amish man.

Two secondary characters captured my heart as well. Their lives mesh with Alice's and Cal's as the plot twists and turns to a crescendo of an exciting climax. Another stunning addition to The Amish of Hart County series.

29434,855,3786,"When introduced to Sophie, life as she knew it is changing, dramatically. Granddaughter of a Viscount, she is being left at a school as he wants nothing to do with her, but family obligations require him, as her guardian, to see to her. Having spent all of her life to this point with her parents and hearing only negative things about her fathers family after his marriage for love to the French opera singer, shes seeing the worst of her fears come to light in her grandfathers anger, brusque nature and dismissive treatment.  The school did, however, bring her two friends who hold her secrets closely, support one another, and meet regularly for tea and catching up. In fact, it was one of her friends connections that found her a position as a companion right out of school, and a small bequest from that lady allowed her to set her plan for self-support and independence in action.  Now, some 12 or 15 years later, Sophie is making her living from gambling: carefully calculating odds, using her skills to quietly build toward a nest egg that will allow her an annuity or an enticing dowry.

Jack, Duke of Ware inherited the title at just twenty-four, and felt the weight of expectation, his mothers censure and his brother Phillips intractability since the beginning. Measured, near anti-social, and wholly consumed with the responsibilities and requirements of his position, yet another debt that Phillip incurred and cant pay while gambling at Vegas, a private club known for members discretion and the surety of debt repayment.  Since Jack won't allow the censure or talk, he pays off Phillips debt, and demands he not return to gamble.  But, Phillip isn't about to be told, and his fascination with Sophie brings him back  demanding she pay attention to him and gamble against him. Finding Phillip satisfactory as a friend, but wholly unsuited as more, including a gambler with his reckless disregard of skill and odds, no one is more shocked (or frankly, threatened) by Wares outrageous demand: a five thousand pound wager if she wins, a week with Ware should she lose.  Of course, shock, anger and the little devil on her shoulder tweak her into taking the bet, and soon she is being whisked out of the club with the Duke, and driven out of London with nary a word.

Oh these two are lovely! Wares first love used and abused him badly, so hes convinced that while marriage is necessary, his will be one well-made with all thoughts to convention and a proper Duchess, not entertaining thoughts of love.  Sophie has kept her ties to the Makepeace name a secret: her parents married for love, but shes hoping for esteem, stability and security: she wants to marry but those concerns come first.  Shes never thought of herself as desirable to a Duke or other member of the ton, in fact a solid middle-class opportunity would suit her perfectly.  But the chemistry between them sparks something between them: soon Jack is seeing the world through her eyes: her quick wit, her intelligence and her pointed questions all have him reeling. More importantly, hes unable to not wonder about her, think about her.
Together, the two are electric, and moments between them shine until the return to London with a vow to never see one another again.

Sure enough, not a full week has passed before the temptation is too great: neither was happy alone, and while Sophie doesnt believe that this affair will lead to more than her broken heart, the comfort, excitement and enjoyment in her time with Jack (and his with her) have them spending more time together.  Surely when Sophie reveals (to one of her best friends) her love for him, and his meddling mother again tries to bend him to her will, the heartbreak is eminent..

A wonderful start to a new series, with a lovely tease for the next title that features one of Sophies best friends.  Love, obligation, choices and family lost and found all play in nicely with a moment where Sophies reactions come solely from her hurt and heartbreak, nearly tearing the two apart forevermore.  The growth of Ware from the tamped-down unemotional man wholly consumed with his responsibilities and title to his emotional awakening and recognition of the need for balance (and Sophie) in his life is wonderful, even when he missteps, his willingness to take a chance, seek advice and ignore his pleading and meddlesome mother are brilliantly shown and made this a read in one sitting title that has me anxious for the next.

>I am an independent reviewer. This book is a standalone work of fiction with beautiful prose and set in Russia. Count Alexander is accused of writing a seditious poem and sentenced to life in a luxury hotel in Moscow. The story drags in the beginning, describing the Counts life and how it changed after his sentencing. Each scene is written in so much detail that all 5 senses must be used in order to truly enjoy this book.
>The plot moves along more in the second half of the book. The Count has befriended a precocious young girl, who grows up to have a young girl of her own. The twists and turns of the Russian government and all of the internal spying are on display. The story mainly revolves around the Count, the MaitreD, the chef, the young girl and the actress.
>The ending is up for debate, with the characters and plot line deliberately vague, as one must be in Moscow at that period of time.  A few questions such as how did the count support himself for his lifetime are never answered. The time period in Russian history is one of constant fear. In one enjoyable scene, the 3 men spend quite a bit of time gathering supplies. The reader is unsure as to the reason why, until the big reveal shows the chef preparing an authentic bouillabaisse using outlawed ingredients.

If you like Greek mythology, The Lightning Thief is an amazing book written by the #1 New York Times bestselling author Rick Riordan and is based on Greek mythology. Percy is a twelve-year-old boy who has dyslexia, ADHD, and is a troublemaker. However, he imagines a lot of things. For example, he imagined his pre-algebra teacher, Ms. Dodds, when there is no teacher that has that name. Another key event is when Percys mom takes him to the same beach where his parents met, and something bad happens. A strong storms comes, and the Minotaur takes Percys mom. Percy has to try saving his mom, and killing the monster by going into the water, and using the lightning bolt. The problem is that he is by himself trying to fight the monster. The moral of this story is that with every choice you make, you become more like yourself. According to the text, it says three days later, he wakes up in the infirmary of Camp Half-Blood, where Grover and Mr. Brunner tell him that he is a demigod, half-mortal and half-god. I think this book is an excellent and interesting book to read. I think that because there is a lot of descriptive details and fascinating information that makes you read on. I would recommend it.

 This book is about Karana who is part of this indian tribe on the island of the blue dolphins. Some of the characters are Karana (main character), Ramo (Karanas little brother), Ulape (Karanas and Ramos older sister), Chief Chowing (Ulapes, Karanas and Ramos dad), Captain Orlov (person from the ship), people from the tribe, and people from the ship, and many more people or animals.  This book is very interesting because so many challenges are happening in this book. Like when she is trying to get a pet to keep her company when there is nobody but her on the island.  For her to survive on this island she has to do everything on her own but you are going to have to find out what happens to see if she survived on her own.

29450,4393,25,"This is my first Margaret Atwood book. For how short it is, it took me a long time to read, but with this book, I think its better that way. Its provocative and thought-provoking, and I know the messages in this book will stay in my mind for years to come.

In short, this novel follows Offred, a handmaid to a Commander in the Republic of Gilead. Her role is to bear the Commanders child for him and his wife, for if she cant, she will become an Unwoman. Handmaids are not allowed any freedoms once embraced by women: they are not allowed to have families, jobs, money of their own; they are only permitted to wear red dress; they cannot talk amongst other handmaids or secure friendships; they are not allowed to read or write; and it is forbidden even to think for themselves. The Republic of Gilead spawned from a world that used to be our world when the government tried to eliminate all of the immoral and sacrilegious acts from society, but the ramifications of that action were the abolition of many liberties that currently go unappreciated, including the independence of women.

I didn't have any idea what this book was about before I started it. I chose it at random from a list of all my unread books, and to be honest, I was a bit hesitant to read it at first. Literary fiction isn't usually my thing, and I struggle with books that are supposed to be read in school. This is one of those books that is rich with meaning. I do wish I could attend some kind of seminar that discusses this book in complex detail so I could delve further into its meaning and purpose because I want to know more about the concept behind this novel. I loved this book, and I want to share my ideas on it with others. I don't think Ive ever wanted to discuss a literary work more than I do with this book. My copy is pre-owned, and it came with highlighted passages in it, but no handwritten notes. I kept finding myself wondering why its previous owner highlighted some of these phrases, and what secrets do they hold that Im not able to see. I highlighted some passages of my own, but Im still curious what treasures this books previous reader found that I wasn't able to see.

Something I did notice was the significance of the colour of clothing. All the handmaids wear red, a colour of blood, of sin, of lust. All the Wives wear blue, a colour of elegance and status. All the Aunts wear brown, a colour of wisdom and maturity. All the daughters wear white, a colour of purity and innocence. All the Marthas wear green, a colour of subservience and cleanliness. And all the Econowives wear stripes because they have to fulfill the roles of Wife, Martha, and handmaid.

When I read a dystopian, the most important thing to me is to learn how and why the world got that way. I cannot read a dystopian and believe that a world without government or with a heavily corrupt government just happened. At the start of this book, I was worried because I was particularly interested in the why of this story, why the world was how it was, but I didn't think any of it would be explained in this short novel. I was wrong. Snippets here, pieces there, and by the end we have the whole backstory, the how and why of this society. I like how Atwood drops bits at a time, not info-dumping all at the beginning, still leaving the reader wondering from chapter to chapter. Another critical element of dystopian novels is that the how and why have to be plausible; I have to really believe that X, Y, and Z could happen to create this kind of society. And in The Handmaids Tale, the backstory is believable enough. I think its a solid and well-thought-out reason for 1985, when the book was published, but looking at it in 2018, it feels a little bit less reasonable, but just a little. With the progress weve made today as far as gender equality and equality in the workforce, Id really be surprised to see something like this happen. But I guess thats the point of a dystopian world, that its surprising and unexpected nonetheless. I did really like the reasons provided in this book, though, and they did help me to understand the world better.

Atwoods writing is very distinctive, probably indicative of her specific style, but I haven't read any of her other books to note the similarities. She has a way of capturing the nuances of the world, details that most people overlook but are a part of everyday life, and I love the way it almost slows down her storytelling, adding in extra bits of information that only add to the imagery of her novel, making the reader focus on specific items and memories. And her writing is in a stream of consciousness style. I don't know that Ive read too many books written like that, but I like it. My mind jumps around a lot, and I can appreciate the quickness that this stylistic choice gives the story, almost like an impatience to say everything on Offreds mind before its too late.

Something interesting is that much of the story is written without quotation marks. It seems like this dialogue is what Offred is thinking in her mind, or what happened in the past, and then when actual quotation marks are used, thats whats actually happening in the present. I wish I knew why Atwood chose to write like this because its a unique choice. I feel like not many authors could pull it off so effectively, so grippingly. Ive read one or two books before that don't use quotation marks, and I just get irritated that I cant tell who is talking and when. The Bible does that too, omitting quotation marks. I just don't like feeling confused about when dialogue is taking place, but in The Handmaids Tale, its evocative; it works without being confusing.

There are also countless comma splices in this book. I don't know how she was able to get all those misused commas past an editor, but somehow I think each incident was deliberate, a point of style. This technique almost never works without creating deep agitation within me, but here I liked it. Margaret Atwood is a writer unlike most, able to make stylistic decisions that other authors wouldnt dare try for fear of seeming unintelligent or uneducated. I don't know how she pulls it off so well.

The Handmaids Tale reminds me a lot of Orwells 1984, which I loved, and I think thats one of the reasons I enjoyed this book so well. I like the premise of a futuristic depressed utopian society thats controlled by the government, even down to peoples thoughts. Its as if the government is a cult. Its terrifying to think about, but thats what makes it so interesting to read about.

I would be petrified to live in this world, especially since I take a lot of pride in my virtue. I would be one of the women to prefer death to this lifestyle. I find it intriguing that all the ways for one to commit suicide have been eliminated in this society, yet the threat of death hangs over the citizens heads with every action. You cant kill yourself, but you can commit some crime and find yourself dead just the same. I love how Offreds every thought ultimately leads to suicide. Everyone is fooled by happiness in this world.

Hes said a forbidden word. Sterile. There is no such thing as a sterile man anymore, not officially. There are only women who are fruitful and women who are barren, thats the law.

This book made me angry, but not necessarily in a bad way. More like an angry that pushes people to take action. How can women be treated this way, perceived as naught but for bearing children, worthless, submissive, two-legged wombs, thats all? This book turns readers into feminists. How can it not? When you're forced to come face to face with the darkest issues that plague your society, you are forced to have an opinion on them. And any person who understands the value in all human beings will see how screwed up the world is in The Handmaids Tale, but they will also see how much it parallels our own world, even thirty years after its publication.

One of the best parts of this book was its ending, more specifically its historical notes post-ending. After the actual ending was left somewhat open-ended and left me wanting more, I read the historical notes on The Handmaids Tale. This fictional symposium transcript illuminated a lot of answers and details on the story, and it put the events directly happening to Offred in a bigger light spanning centuries. Readers were able to see the effects of this society on a later generation, and, most importantly, the events that led to the corrupted government rule present in this book. What was the most astonishing to me were the events listed that forced this society into creating the Republic of Gilead are events happening right now in our world. I cannot explain it even close to the way Atwood portrays it in her book, but the last ten pages of the novel were definitely the most eye-opening for me, and they gave the entire story a whole new meaning.

I cant wait to watch the movie and the new tv series. I hope they just expand on this world in a deeper way. I also am looking forward to reading more books by Margaret Atwood, who may be a newfound favourite author of mine. Im very curious to see how her writing compares across all her works because the writing was my favourite part of this book.

29454,412,3632,"Elizabeth J. Church has a real talent for developing memorable female protagonists, whose personal journeys of transformation and self-discovery play out against vivid historical backgrounds. In her first novel, THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF LOVE, she depicted an aspiring scientist whose career aspirations are stifled by her husbands work at Los Alamos during the era of developing the nuclear bomb. In her second book, ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, Church again brings to life the American Southwest in the middle of the 20th century. This time, however, the backdrop is not the isolated canyons and secret labs of Los Alamos, but the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas in its heyday.

Churchs protagonist is Lily Decker, who, when readers first meet her, is a child growing up in Salinas, Kansas. Following the horrific death of her parents and sister in a car accident (from which Lily walked away unscathed), shes being brought up by her emotionally withholding aunt and her sexually abusive uncle. Lilys only trusted adult is, surprisingly, the man who killed her family, a military pilot she calls simply the Aviator. He fosters Lilys love for books and, especially, her passion for dance, at which she excels. As high school graduation approaches, Lilys dance teacher supports her decision to forego college in favor of a dance career, and she advises Lily to bypass New York or Hollywood and head straight to where the action is: Las Vegas.

Its 1967, and Las Vegass glamour and bright lights offer ordinary folks an escape from the mounting tensions of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. At first, Lily is entranced by Vegas, but she soon grows disillusioned when her first two auditions result in a quick dismissal. One producer pulls her aside for some advice: with her looks and voluptuous figure, a career as a showgirl, not a jazz dancer, will be the road to success for her.

Lily soon overcomes her reluctance to dance topless, especially when she starts collecting her generous paychecks, not to mention the gifts from admirers. But even surrounded by friends and showered with money and adoration, Lily (now known as Ruby Wilde) feels like something is missing --- like her childhood has irreparably damaged her in ways she cant even fully articulate or comprehend.

ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is a novel that is sexy and enticing, with its lush descriptions of Rubys showgirl lifestyle and its celebrity cameos, but it also is full of issues to discuss and think deeply about. Vegass glittery faade masks so much, not least the significant historical events happening elsewhere in the country and in the world. The rift between fantasy and reality --- and how that divide affects Ruby --- is one underlying theme, as is the complicated relationship of women to their bodies and the tendency of abuse to resurface and recapitulate in various ways.

In the end, though, Churchs novel is uplifting, especially as it subverts expectations and shows that there is still, for Ruby/Lily, a chance for recovery and an opportunity to celebrate different kinds of love and different sorts of families. ALL THE BEAUTIFUL GIRLS sheds a different kind of light on a young woman whose value and purpose go far beyond her pretty face.

29455,354,3632,"When I first started reading this book, I thought it was more historical fiction, like Ruby Wilde was real. Especially what with all the name dropping, the mention of timely events and what Ruby was doing during them and all the Vegas hotspots.

It took a while into it before I realized it was just ""true fiction"". That word ""just"" in no way is meant to take away from this story.

I followed Ruby's (Lily's) journey through her highs and lows and had a great time! Well, I still want to kick that Spaniard's A double S though. What an A$$hole!! I think I just seethed up again at the mention of him. Grrr!

29459,412,3499,"About three-quarters of the way through THE SANDMAN, there is a wondrous passage (in a book full of them) that uses trap nets and lobster pots as a metaphor for bad decisions leading irrevocably to disastrous actions. As much as I wanted to gallop through the last hundred pages in the same manner as I had the previous 300, I had to stop and dwell for a few minutes on the perfection of it and what had gone before. It was stunning, as is the plot and prose of this unforgettable thriller.

THE SANDMAN is the fourth installment in Lars Keplers series featuring Joona Linna, the taciturn Stockholm detective inspector. Many of you (but, I dare say, perhaps not enough of you) are familiar with the first three volumes: THE HYPNOTIST, THE NIGHTMARE and THE FIRE WITNESS. This trio will be republished over the next year or so with new translations (thanks to the extraordinary efforts of Neil Smith). But please do not wait to read this latest offering. Kepler does an excellent job of bringing newcomers into the tent while refreshing fans recollections. In any event, you don't want to delay or deny yourself one of the best reading experiences of 2018.

The novel commences in the middle of a precipitous railroad bridge during a nighttime snowstorm. It is there that a young man named Mikael Kohler-Frost is found, wandering and hysterical. The discovery would be unusual enough, but is made more so by the fact that Mikael and his sister, Felicia, had been missing for 13 years and was declared dead. Mikael, who is in the throes of delirium and is all but incoherent, insists that his sister is still alive and is being held captive by someone called the Sandman. Mikaels allegations are of particular interest to Joona. It was he who, years ago after making a major personal sacrifice, caught Jurek Walter, Swedens most notorious serial killer. Jurek, who is permanently ensconced in a maximum security psychiatric hospital, was thought to have numbered Mikael and Felicia among his many victims. Linna was sure that Jurek had an accomplice in his dastardly work, but was never able to prove it.

Mikaels reappearance changes everything. Linna is more certain than ever that Jurek had help, and that if Felicia is ever to be rescued, Jurek has to be persuaded --- or tricked --- into revealing her whereabouts and that of his accomplice. Linna concocts a daring plan to insert an undercover agent into the psychiatric ward where Jurek is imprisoned and to somehow gain his trust. It is the execution of this plan and its aftermath that unfolds during most of the books second half, and the suspense is nothing less than excruciating. The agent selected is Saga Bauer, a quietly damaged inspector who is tapped for the job --- and accepts it --- at the worst possible time for her. She finds herself under siege on the ward from adversaries expected and otherwise.

The most dangerous, of course, is Jurek, who is as frightening and nightmarish a character as you are likely to encounter in a book in quite a while. On the one hand, he is almost too much to take. On the other, it is nearly impossible to stop reading THE SANDMAN at any particular point. Its not that theres no good place to set aside the novel; its that there is practically no way to do that. Kepler keeps things moving with short chapters and frequent changes in points of view. As a result, the reader isn't drawn into the story so much as given to running into it, voluntarily and with abandon. There are many ticking clocks, as Linna and his team set out to rescue Felicia, Bauer tries to save herself, and Jurek does what Jurek does best. Remember the trap nets and lobster pots I mentioned at the beginning of this review? Anyone who starts reading the book will identify with the lobster, particularly during the multiple conclusions that speed the reader toward the final paragraphs.

Ah, those final paragraphs. THE SANDMAN is complete in itself, but anyone who reads it will be sitting on tenterhooks, waiting for the next installment (which already has been published in Sweden). Get the first three books in their new editions and read them while you are waiting. It won't pass the time entirely, but it will help.

29461,4378,444,"Do you have a creative mind? Does your imagination loves to just go out of control and be free? Then A Wrinkle in Time is the right book for you. Its filled with creativity and mystery all around.

A Wrinkle in Time starts off with an odd girl named Meg. Meg is failing school, and uses her father's disappearance as an excuse. While Meg is mourning her fathers disappearance, her brother, Charles Wallace, finds 3 odd women named Mrs. Who, Which, and Whatsit. Meg doesnt think they are normal but Charles doesnt seem to be bothered. However, one day Mrs. Whatsit says she can help find Megs father. Meg and Charles seem suspicious until they tell them they have magic. Calvin, a tall 7th grade boy is a friend of Meg and is summoned by Mrs. Whatsit to take care of Meg while they go on their journey. Meg reluctantly accepts along with Calvin and Charles to go with Mrs. Whatsit to find their father, and so their quest begins. Will they survive and find father, or will they all perish to a close person. Get A Wrinkle in Time to find out.

Overall this book teaches me that even if you don't feel you're a great person, that doesnt mean you cant change it. For example, Meg goes from being like an odd, quirky girl, to a brave heroine risking her life to try to save her father. I feel this book is great and I love how creative, emotional, and lively it is. I hope the movie is, too.

If you are imaginative and love to be creative, Id recommend A Wrinkle in Time to you. Even if its not your genre of choice, this book is still a classic! The perfection this book has mystery, creativity, and all the qualities for a great book.

29463,882,25,"I love dystopian future novels and this fits the mold.  What I really liked about it is that it didn't seem that wildly out there.  Pollution has made fertility rates go down?  Check, that is already happening.  Environmental disasters have made certain parts of the US unlivable?  That has happened to.  The government is overthrown by a conservative religious group that forces woman into subservient roles based on their uses to society?  It hasn't happened yet, but it eerily feels like it could.  The book seemed like it could happen any day, unfortunately even more now so in our current political climate.

This book provided a lot of discussion at book club and even better, most members actually read it this month! What I thought made the novel was the historical note at the end that discusses that the entire book were tapes that were found a couple hundred years in the future and give slight details to think about what could have happened after Offred is lead away at the end of the book.  Im usually not a fan of ambiguous ending, but the historical note really made the novel for me.

We also talked about how easy it would be to take away womens access to their finances and jobs these days, even more so than when the novel was written in the 1980s.  We also talked about how women were banned from reading and the Bible was locked up.  Its easy to take things out of context and force it on people when they are not allowed to read and think for themselves.
I thought it was very interesting that the wife in the situation,  Serena Joy,  was a very vocal advocate of conservative values that were adopted by the new regime.  Offred wonders how Serena now feels living by these traditional values and not allowed to go out and live life in the world like she used to.  Its an interesting thought  telling others to do something and then having to live it yourself are two very different things.

My husband and I started the Hulu series The Handmaids Tale and are about half way through it.  We have limited time watching TV with no kids around so we are very slow at making our way through adult programming.  From what weve seen the show follows the book very well and is very well done.  Any show watchers out there?  What are your thoughts?

I also liked the new forward by the author.  It gave great insight into the novel and also how it is still very relevant in todays society.

Favorite Quotes:

The street is almost like a museum, or a street in a model town constructed to show the way people used to live.  As in those pictures, those museums, those model towns, there are now children.

If its a story Im telling, then I have control over the ending.  Then there will be an ending, to the story, and real life will come after it.  I can pick up where I left off.  It isn't a story Im telling.

They show us only victories, never defeats.  Who wants bad news?

But who can remember pain, once its over?

Overall, The Handmaids Tale is a book that I will be thinking about for years to come.  It is a haunting look at a possible future that I hope we never see.  Its also a great book to use for discussion at a book club.

29464,325,444,"So the story is about brother and sister duo, Charles Wallace and Margaret ""Meg"" trying to find their father. The world in which the story began was lost on me; I didn't know what time it occurred, but it didn't really matter, since they traveled through time. So I  then received a lesson on the fifth dimension. Linear views or folding of time - Oh no, this was something totally different and long winded!

The thing is, the story was not really about finding their father, but more so about  preventing world domination by a giant *****! Uh-oh... sorry, no SPOILERS! The story shared the importance of individuality, equality, love, and faith in Jesus Christ. Now I'm a Christian - you know me - but this book preached! I don't know about you, but I don't like my fiction this religious! Well, not like this. I felt let down by the way it all unfolded.

Lastly, the main characters, excluding the father, was a big, fat whiner! I detest whining. And the narrator made it worse by properly carrying out the perfect voice for whining! I couldn't take it to the point, I cried tears of joy when the book finally ended. It set me in mind of an Einstein-ish Never Ending Story. Yeah, that sounds about right. to me, it's not a children's book- it's YA.

Since I listened to the audiobook, which makes book one of my novel collection, I haven't pressed through the stories (A Wind In The Door & A Swiftly Tilting Planet). I kid you not, I don't think I ever will. If the other two books are anything like this - I submit. I give, Game Over, man! Game Over!

I'll review the movie after I've seen it. (I set it on the back burner)

29468,1197,1172,"Not too good. Pretty boring, actually. The book consists of six completely unrelated short stories, each one jarringly different in tone and substance. The six stories are loosely tied together through the McGuffin of the Shrike and Hyperion.

The whole Shrike thing, while interesting, never pays off. A lot happens, but it never means anything or amounts to much. It looks like you have to read the next three books to understand what is happening. Based on what Ive read here, Im not sure I will bother.

The first of the short stories was the best. Its the one with a missionary stranded in an alien society. But again, its just a sci fi story that has no need of the Shrike or Hyperion for it to work. Those items are just boilerplated on at the end in a ham-fisted way to somehow make this Shrike thing relevant enough to tie all the other stories together. That technique works better with some of these stories than others. But some of the stories were just nonsensical to me.

I had started reading this about twenty years ago, and couldn't remember how it finished. Well I remember now, because it looks like I quit about two thirds of the way through. Now I finally finished it, but Im not sure it was worth it. Not only does the whole Shrike thing not make sense, but the slow, plodding pace of this book is aggravating.

29477,1769,1962,"With the Ministry forced to accept that Voldemort is back, the attacks start becoming more and more public. Fudge is removed from his position replaced by the head of Aurors. Harry is struggling to deal with this and the death of someone he has grown to care about. Going into his sixth year, he discovers that he will be taking private lessons with Dumbledore. Lessons that will help him with the prophecy.

There were many parts of this book that I sped read through because they were just so difficult. I will not say what and when because I don't want to spoil things. I do feel that this book is one of the darker books in the series. It definitely hit me in the feels many times over.

I love the plot of this book. I've loved the plot of the entire series. I feel like as the series has progressed the mood has gotten darker. I often wondered why it didn't start that way. I think I somewhat get it now. She wanted to get us submerged into the world and used to it. She highlighted the dark undertones and then brought them out more as you were familiar with the world.

The characters are amazing. I love them all. I wish certain characters had had a bigger part in this book because I've grown so attached to them. I'm sure it would have interrupted the flow of the story though. I'm glad they have had parts at all. They definitely added character to the story.

Like the first five books, I give this book a full five-star rating. This is and will always be one of my favorite series of all times. I get so into this world it's insane. I am sure this will not be the last time I read this book. It wasn't my first.

  Ready Player One takes place in a future world that has went down the drain.  The world is horrible a living dystopia really and the main way of life is virtual reality the utopia known as the OASIS.  Worlds upon worlds exist within this space and you can do anything and be anyone you want.  Most people spend more time in the OASIS than in the real world, even more since the creators death that launched the hunt.  Upon his death all of his wealth including control over the OASIS is on hold for whoever finds his hidden Easter egg.  He has hidden keys throughout the game and you must get all three and pass through their challenges to move on but the winner will find the ultimate prize.  The creator was obsessed with 80s life from games and pop culture and lived for this world.  Now the race is on and everyone is searching for the egg some willing to kill to control the OASIS and if they do life as it is known will end in the utopia world you can create.

  So Im not a big gamer.  I enjoy playing some games for sure but mostly with others.  Still I can see the appeal just as I would rather spend hours reading/listening to my book hold up somewhere in my own little world I can see how others find the same in games.  I also suck at most games which is probably why I never got really into them. Still the world that is built is amazing.  The OASIS is amazing.  This whole virtual world that basically turns to raising people in it from education, work, and so on.  I understand it right away and was pulled in.  Wade is one of those kids he makes his own way in this harsh world and has dedicated years of his life to solving this puzzle.  He clearly loves the hunt and research for it logging in every show/movie/music/game/etc from the 80s he is an encyclopedia of knowledge and can site most of it off the cuff.  He is doing what he can to search but traveling in the OASIS costs money and he doesnt have any hence the copious amounts of research.

For a bunch of hairless apes, weve actually managed to invent some pretty incredible things.

  The search had gone so long without the first key being found that many had given up the hunt.  Still as a discovery is made the hunt has a huge resurgence and things get a whole lot more interesting.  Wade is suddenly a OASIS celebrity and everyone is trying to find out who he really is (because no one uses their real data online when you can be anyone/anything you want to be) and the information he found.  Soon the game is a foot yet again and the stakes become even higher as a cooperation reaches out and makes an offer for his assistance making the consequences clear if he chooses not to take the offer.  Danger is real and not just in the virtual world.  This is pretty great since the majority of the story takes place in VR making the consequences seem less than dire but really it never occurred to me.  I always felt the stakes were high for sure.  If you die in VR you start from scratch including everything you had earned which when you are in a race that would be a hard blow.

Youd be amazed how much research you can get done when you have no life whatsoever.

  Cline also has a way of writing that makes the VR world seem as vital as the real world.  It is in many ways given the importance and prevalence of it in the world.  The world is full of fantastic characters that you want to know more about, moral dilemmas, and questions about life all on top of this epic journey full of 80s nostalgia and some of the best lines and quips around.  I fell in love with this book and the writing.  Some parts made me cringe, laugh, gasp and more.  It was a thrill ride from start to finish and I couldn't wait to see how it all played out in the end.  For a book wrote several years ago it was shockingly on point and I loved every moment of it.  It has also given me this urge to check out some classic/older games and some of the older more obscure movies referenced in the book I had never heard of before.  The only down side is having read it so close to the movie release now when I see a trailer I see differences and I just hope the movie is even half as good as the book because Im stoked to see it.  And I will see it the earliest time its available!

That was when I realizes, as terrifying and painful as reality can be, its also the only place where you can find true happiness.

29479,1935,3865,"Post-apocalypse stories have come in and out of fashion over the years, but its hard to think of a more popular one thats gained as much traction as The Walking Dead. (I know this seems like a tangent, but bear with me.) And with my love of horror, people always get a bit surprised when I told them that I quit The Walking Dead about two seasons in, and never regretted it for a moment. The reason, though, is simple: I realized early on that, as was evidenced in both Kirkmans source material and the TV series, the series was little more than misery porn, devoted to breaking its characters and rubbing our faces in the worst of humanity. And look  Im a horror junkie. Ive seen some twisted films, met some insane villains. But the thing about horror novels and films is that they're finite; they tell a story, and then they end. Meanwhile, I realized that The Walking Dead was intended to be unending, which meant that it would just be a constant succession of horrors, all constantly trying to outdo the last, leaving the viewer in an arms race of misery and horror. And honestly, thats the last thing I need in my life.

So what, you're asking, does any of that have to do with The Dog Stars?

Like The Walking Dead, The Dog Stars is a post-apocalyptic story, although one without zombies. No, this is closer to Stephen Kings The Stand, where a disease has wiped out much of the population of the planet. And as youd imagine, survival has become difficult. Luckily, Hellers protagonist  a pilot named Hig  has teamed up with a survivalist named Bingley, the sort of person who spent his entire life planning for just something like this, and knows exactly what he needs to do. Bingley is the sort of person who would thrive in Kirkmans zombie apocalypse: hes careful, thoughtful, proactive, shoots first and asks questions later. Hes armed to the teeth, self-sufficient, and trusts no one but Hig  and even that is only because the two men can help each other.

But heres what separates The Dog Stars from The Walking Dead, and why I loved it so much: this isn't Bingleys story. Instead, its Higsand Hig doesnt want to live in the same world that Bingley does. I don't mean that hes suicidal, although you could forgive him for being so; it won't take long for you to realize how much Hig lost when the world fell apart, and to say that he doesnt exactly love Bingley is an understatement. (He does have his dog, though, and its not hard to see his dog as the band-aid that hes using to cope with things  something Hig himself admits as well.)

No, what I mean is that Hig fundamentally cant  and doesnt want to  be Bingley. Hes an optimist at heart, someone who wants to help people, who hopes that Bingleys armaments and defenses are for naught, that you can trust the people you meet. Thats not to say that Hig is an idiot or naive. Hes not, and Heller makes that distinction clear quickly. But hes not a bleak survivalist, either; he wants to give the world a chance, to do more than just survive and stay alive  he wants to find something more to live for than just living for its own sake.

And if that was all The Dog Stars was  the conflict between Bingley and Hig to see which point of view was right  that, in of itself, could be fascinating. But it doesnt take long for us to begin to see that Heller has more on his mind, as Hig shows himself capable of ruthless behavior, and Bingley becomes more than just a violent boor. And that takes Hellers world up a notch, as we embrace both the complexity of their new lives and the nuances of their characterand just when we have a handle on that, a lot of things change, and the book evolves into something else again.

I don't love the way The Dog Stars is written  the conceit is that Hig suffered from a massive fever that damaged his brain a little, and his writing can be a little unfocused as a result  and for a bit, I wasn't keen on continuing. But as I went, and got more used to Higs voice, I started warming to the book, which may end up being the warmest, most hopeful apocalypse book Ive read in some time. Make no mistake: The Dog Stars never gets absurdly cheery or strains credulity, but it also tries to find a place for hope, human connections, and kindness, even in the face of massive destruction. And its hard not to love a book that does that, especially when so much fiction defaults nowadays to bleakness and grim outcomes. (Again, I don't mind it in some books; what I mind is the ubiquity of it.) More than that, though, The Dog Stars works because it lets its characters live and breathe, defying easy categorization and summary. Its not a book that gives us easy heroes or villains; sure, some of us (particularly in these politicized times) might be closer to the hopefulness and generosity of Hig, while others are the stern, safe Bingleybut maybe theres something necessary in each of us. And thats a nice message to find in a book, even before it creates a rich world, interesting characters, and tells a great story.

I cant recommend this one enough; yes, you may think you're tired of post-apocalyptic tales, but maybe thats because you haven't read one that looks at the apocalypse as less of an ending, and more of a chance for a second start.",1520812800,5,postapocalyps stori come fashion year hard think popular one that gain much traction walk dead know seem like tangent bear love horror peopl alway get bit surpris told quit walk dead two season never regret moment reason though simpl realiz earli evidenc kirkman sourc materi tv seri seri littl miseri porn devot break charact rub face worst human look im horror junki ive seen twist film met insan villain thing horror novel film theyr finit tell stori end meanwhil realiz walk dead intend unend meant would constant success horror constantli tri outdo last leav viewer arm race miseri horror honestli that last thing need life your ask dog star like walk dead dog star postapocalypt stori although one without zombi closer stephen king stand diseas wipe much popul planet youd imagin surviv becom difficult luckili heller protagonist pilot name hig team survivalist name bingley sort person spent entir life plan someth like know exactli

29482,384,1859,"It was my goal to read all five of the fiction finalist nominees for the National Book Critics Circle Awards. I almost made it. This, the fourth out of five I'd read, was as far as I got. And this was a rather phenomenal novel, unlike anything else I've ever read.

Nadia and Saeed meet and stumble uncertainly into a relationship in an unnamed country in which civil war has begun, quietly, sneakily, with factions of differing political and religious beliefs at odds, intolerance and massacre of ""others"" becoming the terrorific norm --- not unlike many countries all over the world, now, and a horrific harbinger of what could well bloom from the seeds planted here which have already wrought 45 and his gop/jackbooted cronies and deplorables.

Rumors are whispered about mysterious doors through which one can step from this unnamed war-torn country into safer, named other locations --- Greece, United States, London --- but refugees, those migrating, are not always welcome and those caught trying to escape are slaughtered. However, Nadia and Saeed manage to make it, exiting from more than one place to another, in transplantations that are the stuff of magical realism but made to seem perfectly normal by Moshin Hamid's adept and adroit prose styling.

This is a novel that defies genre, in which are explored the global refugee crisis, religious fanaticism, gender norms --- Nadia wears a long black robe, obscuring her shape, priestess-like, not because she is religious, but because she wishes to be protected from the presumptions of men,  and the dynamics of natives versus transplants in a world with fewer and fewer borders yet more and more division.

It is not one of the avalanche of dystopian novels; there is, in fact, a certain foundation of hope in the narrative, a not unhappy ending. It is artful, it is fresh, it is full of fine, accomplished writing, and it is thought-provoking. Too, I imagine that nearly every reader will identify with the protagonists, and, too, in this world now, wonder what they would do if (or, more and more likely, WHEN) they find themselves in the same situation as Nadia and Saeed. Is there any among us since November 2016 who hasn't wondered when it is we might need to flee?

29484,3487,3748,"This latest in the Gray Man series is lacking some of the zest that was in the two previous books in the series.  This author started out with pure action - as I wrote in a previous review of those earlier works - think Mack Bolan from the 1970's - this author evolved into something much better - however, he has slipped just a bit with this book, Agent in Place.

Also, he barely mentions the gear that the characters in the book use, which he had done a masterful job of in his prior books in this series.  Always nice to know what gear is getting the nod from the action boys, that Greaney interviews.

In this novel, our Gray Man, has no romantic involvements and his two women from the prior book are mentioned only in passing.

To me the plot was a little thin, but with action novels one does not expect a lot, but I had gotten used to more in the last few books in this series.

The plot is pretty straight forward - the Gray Man is hired to ""rescue"" the mistress of the leader of a Middle-Eastern country, so, she can be used to help bring about regime change - which of course goes totally sideways and ends up with ""our hero"" having to travel to the Middle-East on another rescue missing, plus more.

The Gray Man is as close as we can currently get to a real ""Matt Helm"" type of character, but still it was bothersome for the Gray Man to be moralizing about the tactics used by some of the military contractors.

29487,4378,1721,"Have you ever solved a mystery or have been a detective for a day? Nancy Drew is a detective in her small town of River Heights. She solves common mysteries as an 18 year old girl. Nancy and her father, Carson Drew, usually work together because he is a lawyer in River Heights. Nancy Drews personality is very positive and determined. Through any difficult or confusing mystery, Nancy Drew will never give up.
Nancy Drew can solve many mysteries and challenging situations. She is very clever and outgoing because she has many strategies that lead her to solving the mystery.  Her father supports his detective daughter by helping the citizens of River Heights. In this interesting book, there are many ups and downs. In the story, Nancy realizes that Josiah Crowley, a man who doesnt keep his promises, dies. He promised his family and friends a great amount of money in his will. Unfortunately, he didn't tell the people where to find the will. Nancy Drew is very concerned about this and wonders where it is or if it exists. Do you think Nancy will solve the mystery of the missing will? To find out, read The Secret Of the Old Clock by Carolyn Keene.

In this interesting story, the theme would be to never give up and to always help people in need. I think this, because in the story Nancy faces challenging situations that were very hard for her to solve. I think this book was very good and interesting to read. If you like a mystery book you would love to read this story about the fortune of Josiah Crowley. I would recommend this book to younger readers because it has a moral to learn and it teaches you how to never give up.

But I have always had intentions to read it.  Well then two of me crew in rather quick succession wrote their thoughts about it and solidified me desire to read it.  And so I have.

For such a short book, it took me a rather long time to read because I had to savor it in delightful little bits.  This novel truly deserves the designation of a classic.  The story is silly and seemingly simple but oh what delightful use of language.  I loved the evocative illustrations by Jules Feiffer and how even the type on the page helps to tell the story.  It is the kind of book with clever layers that make it a lovely read for people of all ages.

A favourite quote:

Do all those words mean the same thing? gasped Milo. Of course. Certainly. Precisely. Exactly. Yes, they replied in order. Well, then, said Milo, not understanding why each one said the same thing in a slightly different way, wouldnt it be simpler to use just one? It would certainly make more sense. Nonsense. Ridiculous. Fantastic. Absurd. Bosh, they chorused again, and continued. Were not interested in making sense; its not our job, scolded the first. Besides, explained the second, one word is as good as anotherso why not use them all?

29508,666,3852,"High Voltage by Karen Marie Moning is the 10th book in her Fever series.  I am a fan of Moning and her fantastic Fever series.  We have been waiting a long time for Danis story, and I for one could not wait to get my hands on High Voltage.

Background: Dani OMalley has been one of my all time favorites, and when we met her at the start, she was a precocious 14 year old girl, who became Macs (Fever heroine) best friend, and together they fought off the enemies that haunted them all.  Dani had a terrible childhood, being caged by her mother, until she escaped and became one of the youngest sidhe-seers at the abbey.  Rowena was the leader of the girls in the abbey, and we learned over time, that she changed Dani into a fierce warrior, and also a killer.  It pained me to see that Dani and Macs friendship ended when Mac found out who killed her sister.  When Dani spent over 5 years in the Silvers (Fae ), she changed into Jada, a polished and grown woman, who returned to the abbey to be the powerful leader of the of sidhe-seers.  Ryodan, our hero, has known forever that Dani/Jada was destined for him, but he had to wait for this young girl to grow up into a woman. In Feversong, it was great to see Dani and Mac resume their deep friendship to help bring peace in Ireland.

In High Voltage, the story revolves around Dani and Ryodan and war that is on the horizon between the Fae, Gods and humans.  Dani is a very confident young woman, knowing how powerful she has become, as well as being fearless.  Its been two years since Ryodan left saying he had to go away, and would be back.  She resents that he has not called or left a message in those two years.  Dani finds herself in serious situations, one from a soul stealer that she manages to escape.  Shortly thereafter, Ryodan returns and Dani gives him the cold shoulder.  We have known for many books that Ryodan is the man for Dani, but we also knew she had to grow up.  Now this is their time, and their lust for each other was hotter than hell.  But Ryodan was holding back, making sure Dani was really ready for him, and had the same feelings.  Moning did this perfectly, and when we get nearer to the end, we will have our wishes granted.

But first Dani must survive what is happening to her, as well as those trying to kill her.  Slowly, Dani finds her body turning black, which started after she killed a hunter (dragon).  She works with Kat (another regular who runs the Abbey), and the sidhe-seers to stop the villain, who is killing many people. We also get to see Christian and Sean again, one ready to fight and the other unable to control his darkness.  We also got to see the Nine help Dani and Ryodan fight off attacks from the Faes.

What follows is an ultra exciting story that puts Dani and everyone in danger.  But the best part of this story was  the romance between Ryodan and Dani that we have waited forever.  Ryodan is tough, intense and violent, but Dani makes him feel again, and his love for her was beautiful to see.  Dani knows she loves Ryodan, and as she continues to gain more power, she is ready to act on her love.  As her body changes each day, she becomes a dangerous tool that could help fight the enemy, but will  ruin everything else by her inability to touch anyone.

I will not give spoilers, but the last third of the book, was very emotional  in so many levels. the powerful love of Dani and Ryodan; her love for her Hel-Cat Shazam was fun; and when she meet YRill and learns what she has become.  OMGKaren  that was so awesome.  I had smiles on my face a long time after I finished the book, making me completely happy.

It is a great way to get out and learn the area where you live or wherever you may go.

I listened to the audio version of Warcross. I liked Emika (Emi) who is totally relatable: She is a regular girl with real struggles we all face.  She does what she has to do to survive.  Shes a bounty hunter too!

Warcross is a beyond popular game worldwide and people live for this game.  It is all some people live and breathe.  There is a Hunger Games-ish feel to it with the popularity of Warcross.  To summarize the description Emi finds herself in Tokyo with the creator of Warcross. She is offered a job that will be a lot of money, more than enough to take care of herself.  Emi finds herself in the games final tournament and things change as she makes discoveries: Things are not what they seem.

There is a romantic subplot that occurs that I cannot go into details about, but I felt it was inappropriate. But for the YA audience that this novel is geared towards, it was hot!

As I am not a gamer, I did find myself losing interest in the novel when Emi was playing Warcross. Everything else had me pulled in!  I wanted to know what was going to happen next! I did figure out the twist as to who the villain was: To me it was obvious. But then Lu had that final twist that I did NOT see coming!  OMG, I need the next book now!!!!  Warcross could be read as a standalone and it makes you wonder if our world is heading toward this as reality: Will the virtual world become more important than the real world?  It seems like we are heading that way as we are all attached semi permanently to our phones.

Warcross is very highly recommended and I am very much anticipating the sequel!",1520812800,5,would never pick warcross im gamer game recent play mobil game call ingres locat base augment realiti game play husband great way get learn area live wherev may go listen audio version warcross like emika emi total relat regular girl real struggl face surviv she bounti hunter warcross beyond popular game worldwid peopl live game peopl live breath hunger gamesish feel popular warcross summar descript emi find tokyo creator warcross offer job lot money enough take care emi find game final tournament thing chang make discoveri thing seem romant subplot occur cannot go detail felt inappropri ya audienc novel gear toward hot gamer find lose interest novel emi play warcross everyth el pull want know go happen next figur twist villain obviou lu final twist see come omg need next book warcross

Would You Rather? is a lovely memoir about a woman who grew up in a sheltered, moderately conservative area coming to terms with her sexuality. The reason this is so revolutionary is because, as Katie herself says, there are so few widespread stories about adults realizing they're gay. So many people say that they always knew, it leaves little room in the narrative for people like Katie, who didn't always know. Overall, it was an enjoyable read that Im glad I picked up!

29515,84,1173,"The Dial Press and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of My Name is Venus Black.  I was under no obligation to review this book and my opinion is freely given.

A straight-A student with a bright future, 13 year old Venus Black commits a shocking crime that tears her family apart.  Because she refuses to explain her actions, Venus is convicted and sent to juvenile prison for five years.  Her autistic brother Leo goes missing while Venus is incarcerated and, despite the efforts of the police and volunteers, no trace of him can be found.  After her release, Venus assumes a new name and attempts to start her life again.  Will Venus be able to escape her past or will it have a way of finding her?  Will she ever get the closure she needs to move forward?

My Name is Venus Black is a character driven novel with a good premise and well paced plot.  It was so easy to become engrossed in this book, with the compelling story of a young girl who had to face unthinkable circumstances.  As she tries to move forward with her life, Venus faces very realistic struggles.  I really liked how the author treated the very sensitive subject matter and went into just enough detail to make the story complete.

  --Thoughts from Dr. William Stipp

Winter Sisters is the poignant story of two young girls and their struggle to survive after being caught in a snow storm and disappearing. In March of 1879 a raging blizzard hit Albany, New York leaving Emma and Claire ODonnell stranded outside their school. The young girls, seven and ten years old, were picked up by a stranger offering to help them make it home. Little did the girls know that they were not headed home nor would they ever see their parents again.

The ODonnell sisters story sadly unfolds as Mary Sutter Stipp and her husband, William, begin their search for the lost girls. The story of their kidnapping and subsequent time in captivity is one of absolute horror for any parent to imagine. The details are disclosed as the novel tells the tale of the girls release and their life following these difficult events. Three families lives are entwined in this novel; the Sutter-Stipps, the Van der Veers, and the ODonnells.  The weaving of their stories and the complexities engages the reader from the very beginning of the novel.

This book will appeal to readers of historical fiction. It is a very deep and not very happy story.  The historical detail is interesting and the characters are extremely complex. I enjoyed meeting characters from Ms. Oliveiras previous novel, My Name is Mary Sutter.  In spite of the subject, the novel is an excellent, well told story. The subject is handled with honesty and dignity. I highly recommend the book.

29528,2628,3846,"Olivia Brownlow spent a portion of her childhood living on the street pretending to be a boy while stealing on the streets of London in order to survive.  When one of her thefts goes bad and she is caught, she lucks out by her uncle taking her in and treating her how to be a lady in high society.  Unfortunately, it is hard to leave behind the only life she has ever known.  Just when she thinks she has turned a corner, a face from the past comes back into her life.  Jack MacCarron has become the adopted nephew of one of Londons riches families.  Jack used to be on the street as well and was known as the Artful Dodger.  His new aunt is using him and his skills to gain enough wealth to stay in high standing.  When Jack finds out that Olivia is using her skills as well to help the local orphans, he decides that together they may be able to do enough good to outweigh the bad of their pasts.

I so enjoyed the last book Langdon wrote and was really looking forward to this retelling.  It has been several years since the last time I read Oliver Twist so this seemed like an entirely new story to me.  In fact, after I read this, I had to go back and read Oliver Twist again to see what the similarities were, which happened to be more of a slight alternation rather than full retelling.  The dynamic between Olivia and Jack was played out really well, along with that of Olivia and most of those she interacted with.  The romance played out really well and didn't seem forced, which is always a nice today in todays novels.  The writing was very well done and told in an exciting way, but it may not click for all audiences (what book ever does).  I think many people will enjoy Olivia Twist, especially those that are fans of the original Dickens novel.  I recommend this for fans of the original and anyone who enjoys a good historical fiction novel.

29534,412,3652,"In 1918, Philadelphia overflowed with the promise of an exciting and progressive urban environment. Although the Great War took away some of its youngest and bravest,  opportunities could be found on every corner, every cobblestone street. Pauline Bright and her husband came to this busy city filled with the hope that they would offer their three daughters --- Evelyn, Maggie and Willa --- a much better life than they had had growing up.

However, within months of settling in, the Spanish Flu attacks the United States. As the pandemic claims more than 12,000 Philadelphians, the Brights are left with a world that looks nothing like the one in which they had found so much excitement. Loss and fear find them, but amidst the tragedy and challenges, they decide to take in a new family member, an orphaned baby. And, with that new life, the Brights find the real opportunity for happiness for which they came to Philadelphia in the first place.

Author Susan Meissner weaves a tale that explores a difficult time in American history told through the very real, emotionally resonant endurance and bravery of beautifully drawn characters. Pauline and her daughters allow Meissner a chance to look at what really ties mothers and daughters together --- how one generation learns from and enriches another, old to young and vice versa. The lessons that the baby forces the Bright family to learn give Meissner a nuanced palate on which to draw a compelling and memorable dramatic journey for her readers.

I had no idea the gap between earth and heaven is narrow, no wider than a jump over a brook. Id always thought heaven was so far from the living, no one could measure its distance from earth. Even the wisest person ever born couldn't look up at the night sky through the most powerful telescope and catch a glimpse of heaven --- it was that far off. Paulines introspection and her fearlessness in the face of so much turmoil is a heart-stirring portrait of a mother who must suffer loss in order to grasp fully what love really means. In her life as a woman in a changing time, during a tragic period of history, Paulines stoic heart gives the book a depth that makes it a searing picture of all womens journeys in the 20th century. So much outward change could not diminish the love and bravery of American women like Pauline.

In these times, when the world feels as if it is turning everyone on their heads and back again in the blink of an eye, AS BRIGHT AS HEAVEN stands out as a compelling story of a mother and her daughters who maintain resolve and face life like Wonder Women. When the reader feels as if the world outside is too much, Pauline and her daughters can provide an emotional kick that reminds us all that we are stronger than our circumstances and that the American woman has been always a resilient and unstoppable force.

29535,2082,3652,"Overall I enjoyed this book. If I were rating the first two-thirds of the book I would have given 5 stars easily, but the last third of the book dragged on and felt too contrived. As Bright as Heaven was the very personal story of one family during the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918.  The Bright family had a unique relationship with death. After their new born son dies, they move from the country into Philadelphia to live with their uncle who owns a funeral parlor.  They are literally surrounded by death, so when people around them begin to die from the Spanish flu they have a unique perspective on the epidemic.  When the flu strikes in their own family it consequences are severe, but a chance encounter leads them to find a small infant who needs their help.  This child helps them deal with the death that surrounds them. The story is told through multiple perspectives, and the grief and loss of this family felt raw and real. The epidemic left almost no one untouched and this story did a fantastic job of showcasing the enormity of the epidemic.  The characters were beautifully developed, and the details of the flu and the war added depth to the story, but it felt like the part of the story that came after the flu epidemic was forced.  While the author did try to address some of the loose ends, she chose to over simplify a case of PTSD for the sake of a 'happy ending' and introduced extremely unrealistic elements like a child working in a speakeasy, and a female psychiatrist that falls in love with a patient's husband, which all felt artificial and took away from the genuine quality of the earlier chapters.

29536,412,1173,"From debut author Heather Lloyd comes MY NAME IS VENUS BLACK, a page-turning journey through murder, tragedy and all the woes of coming of age, and learning that there is a huge gray area between right and wrong.

Venus Black is an ambitious, straight-A student whose interests include astronomy and caring for her developmentally challenged younger brother, Leo. She is also a murderer. When we first meet Venus, few details about her life are revealed to us except that she has just killed her stepfather, and no one, not even she, is sure why. She will not speak to police, media reporters or therapists, except to blame her mother, Inez, who she calls by her first name.

In a cadenced and generously hopeful style, readers watch as a 13-year-old girl is run through the gauntlet that is the United States judicial system. Her shock at having done something so terrible is only outweighed by her horror at having to serve time for her crime. She knows she has done something wrong, but given her previously spotless record, the notion of punishment is foreign to her. In alternating chapters, readers meet Leo, who is on the spectrum. In the days following Venus arrest, Leo goes to stay with a friend of his mothers. In brisk but highly descriptive vignettes, we see the world through Leos eyes --- how some shirts can be the wrong blue and how a simple brush of the arm can be overwhelmingly horrifying.

Then the unimaginable happens: Leo is kidnapped. Forced to grapple with the news behind bars, Venus becomes distraught and buckles down, ready to get through her sentence as quickly and quietly as possible so that she may find Leo again.

More than five years later, Venus is released, now a woman of 19. She remains estranged from Inez and is desperate to avoid journalists who have been gearing up for her release for years. Using a fake identity, Venus gets a fresh start in Seattle, where she begins to form connections with new people, including Piper, a young girl who seems to reflect the childhood Venus gave up so many years ago. As Venus starts to put down roots, old traumas quickly resurface, drawing up new questions about right and wrong, and forgiveness and redemption. Unfortunately for her, it seems that the only way to truly bury the past is to work through it, and that means confronting the reasons for her crime.

Although Leo has been kidnapped, Lloyd does not let him drop from the narrative, and we continue to see the world through his eyes --- including the identity of his kidnapper and the kind souls he encounters through them. Lloyd does a stellar job of writing through Leos eyes without ever seeming voyeuristic or gratuitous. She respects Leos views and celebrates them while still providing soft humor in the moments that his understanding of events does not match our own.

It is in these chapters that another character, Tessa, is introduced. In many ways, she is the mirror image of Venus, sans the criminal activity. Tessa was one of my favorite parts of MY NAME IS VENUS BLACK, and her love of Leo, which sprang not from blood but from an inherent sense of compassion, brought me to tears on multiple occasions. Tessa provides some much-needed lightness to the narrative, and I believe many readers will be drawn to her instantly.

As Venus attempts to work through her trauma, she also comes closer than ever to finding Leo --- and reconciling with Inez. But how can you reconcile with a mother you still blame for your years behind bars? And what really happened on the night that Venus stepfather was murdered? Lloyd maintains a perfect level of suspense throughout the book, and trust me when I say that youll definitely want to read along to find out the truth.

In stories involving children and complicated scenarios, it is often the children who have the most clear-cut version of events --- and the most heartbreakingly obvious realizations about what has happened and what must happen. MY NAME IS VENUS BLACK displays this theme perfectly through the eyes of Venus, Leo, Piper and Tessa. It is Venus story, true, but Lloyd treats her other characters with a great deal of respect and a generous, but not overbearing, sense of hope. While this story alone may not appeal to all readers, I trust that everyone will find something to love in Lloyds compassionate attention to detail when it comes to her characters and their actions. This is the sort of book that you will want to discuss for days after reading it, and it will inspire some terrific conversations about parental responsibility, the judicial system and the rights of families.

Readers of INFINITE HOME and KITCHENS OF THE GREAT MIDWEST will love this timely novel about survivors whose lives were ripped apart by secrecy and violence and the ragtag cast of characters they encounter as they heal and grow. Lloyd is an imaginative, risk-taking storyteller, and I look forward to meeting the characters she introduces in her next book.

29537,4378,1104,"You better be home before dark, or the Gobblers will get you! says every parent in Lyras town. Lyra is a young, brave, and  outgoing girl living at Jordan College. She and her friend Roger, who is just like Lyra, spend day after day having fun climbing rooftops and having mudball fights. Roger is always by Lyras side... until he went missing. Lyra thinks that it is the work of a Gobbler, and she and her dmon, Pan, are worried. She wants to tell her uncle, Lord Asriel, a half-cruel-half-nice type of guy, but then Lyra remembers that he is off in the North where he has explorations.

 Later in the day, the Master, an old, frail guy who runs the place when Lord Asriel isn't there, invites scholars from the Womens College. Lyra has to come and thinks that she won't have a fun time, but she was wrong. One of the scholars that the Master has invited was a beautiful, young, smart women with her dmon in the shape of a golden monkey, Mrs. Coulter. Lyra talks and talks with her explaining how she spends her days. In the evening, the Master invites Lyra to talk in the Retiring Room where he tells her that she is becoming too old to stay in Jordan College. She needs to go to school or the Womens College. She is upset and mad, but before she gets a word out, the Master says that Mrs. Coulter can be her guardian. He hands her the alethiometer, a device that tells you the truth. She has to figure out how to read it on her own.

The theme of the book is to never let your friends down. No matter what, Lyra always stuck by her friends side, and went to go get Roger in the North. The friends you pick could be the people that you are with for the rest of your life. If you let them down, you won't have that.

Philip Pullman the Golden Compass was a good book. Out of five stars, Id rate 4 stars because it had a very good story line, but it was sometimes jumbled.

29542,503,3845,"In the third and final novel, audiences get a thrilling conclusion to the characters of Casey Cox, Dylan Roberts, and Detective Keegan just to name a few.  Casey has been running for a long time to avoid being arrested for a series of crimes.  Dylan has been hired by the parents of Brent Pace to apprehend her for his murder and other infractions of the law.  However, since the first book, Casey has amassed a lot of evidence to prove who the real culprits are behind Brents murder and others as well.
The hard part is that while Casey has been on the run and while Dylan is trying to clear her name, those who committed the murders are also closing in on Casey.  Caseys character is one of not just surviving but also seeing that justice is done.  What Casey is learning is the difference between obtaining justice her way or letting go to let God do it His way, as well as take care of her.  Dylan has been praying for Casey to come to faith because he knows that without the Lord she will never know true peace.

Identical twins, Harper and Tabitha, inseparable in childhood, have a falling out when their parents divorce and they are forced to choose which one will live with which parent. It causes a rift which is exacerbated years later by the death of Tabitha's infant son for which she blames Harper. When their father, Billy, with whom Harper has long lived, dies, Tabitha and her mother, Eleanor, come to the service Harper has planned, where Tabitha is mistaken for Harper and attacked by the wife of the married man with whom Harper has been dallying.

In short (well, not that short, it could have happened way sooner I think) the two have traded islands -- Nantucket for Martha's Vineyard, and the Vineyard for Nantucket, and, to some degree, lives, being mistaken for each other, gaining insight into the other's life, and, eventually, having to face their pasts, and decide about their futures.

29549,1404,987,"The Boy on the Bridge by author M.R. Carey is a prequel/sidequal to his zombie apocalypse tale, The Girl With All the Gifts. The first book tells the reader about the disease that caused the apocalypse, the hungries as the zombies are called for their insatiable appetite for fresh protein, and the efforts to find a cure. It includes the manning of the Rosalind Franklin (Rosie), an armoured mobile science lab, by a crew including a young Hungry named Melanie. This second book tells us what happened to Rosies original crew.

This earlier crew includes an uneasy mix of military and scientists who have undertaken a journey to try to uncover caches of hungry tissue samples that were buried in a variety of locations by an earlier expedition that has since disappeared. The hope is to discover an ecosystem in which the fungus cannot survive. Among the crew is a fifteen-year-old scientific genius named Stephen Greaves. Whether he is on the autism spectrum or suffers from PTSD due to early trauma, Stephen has trouble dealing with others. It is this inability to communicate that pushes much of the story forward. It is also my biggest problem with this book  - he makes an important discovery but, despite putting himself and everyone else in danger for it, he refuses to tell anyone including Dr Samrina Khan, a scientist who has been like a mother to him.

Despite this criticism, The Boy on the Bridge is a very compelling read. Although the story is told in a third person narrative, it provides various points of view giving an interesting insight into how different people respond to the disaster differently from those who sincerely want to find a cure to those who see it as a means to advance themselves even as the world collapses around them. It has interesting characters especially Rina and Stephen and plenty of tension as well as action. It is also almost unremittingly bleak. If you have read the first book, you will know not to expect a happy ending here  where The Girl With All the Gifts was, at heart, a dystopian thriller, The Boy on the Bridge is a tragedy.

29552,4754,435,"Following department policy of teaming the most experienced detective working the cold case files with the youngest and least experienced, Harry Bosch finds himself with a new partnerLucia Sotoin this far-ranging tale of mistaken murder, high stakes robbery of a cash-checking business on Mothers Day, the day the welfare or Medicare payments arrive in Moms mailbox and an act of arson that leads to the death of two dozen children. Lucia has a personal interest in the arson case because, unknown to her LAPD superiors, she was a survivor of that long-ago fire, an event which led her years later to abandon her dream of becoming a lawyer and enter the police academy hoping to one day find those responsible for the deaths of her childhood friends and teachers.

Did a bullet meant for another member of a mariachi band lodge in the spine of the musician standing next to him? When the wounded man dies nine years after the shooting, Harry and Lucia began their task of unraveling old clues and conflicting testimony. Suspicious that Lucia spends some many hours in the old files, Harry discovers that she is putting in as much time on the arson case as she is on the one assigned to them: the murdered mariachi.

Several crimes interweave through this engrossing addition to the Harry Bosch series and Connelly holds us in suspense until the last moment on many of them. As usual Bosch is just trying to survive his latest delayed retirement from LAPD, but no deference is paid to his decades on the force or his dedication to the job. Because one of the suspects in the mariachi case is linked to a highly regarded ex-mayor of Los Angeles who is now seeking to become the next governor of California, the supervisors of the cold case section ride Harry from sunup to sundown.

29554,4378,1707,"A lot of interesting things happen in a gorillas lifetime.  You would usually hear about this in a third person point of view, but what if you read an autobiography of a gorilla in first person?
The One and Only Ivan is a story about a gorilla named Ivan, that lives in an animal exhibit at a mall.  Off of exit I95.  He lives with his friends Stella the elephant and Bob the dog.  You would see what the life is like through a gorillas eyes.
  Ivan the gorilla, the main character, is not your usual gorilla. He loves to paint, draw, and sometimes, he even tries to write.  Stella the elephant is Ivans neighbor and is a kind, wise, and gentle character.  Bob is a terrier who is very impatient and sometimes unkind, he doesnt care for small talk, acts like he is too good for anybody, and usually doesnt care or listen to your problems.
  The main moral of the story is to be aware of what other people and even animals could be going through.  Even though you don't know them, that doesnt mean that you know what their past was like, or that you can just judge them based on the way they look.
I would recommend this story to anyone who likes a heartfelt and emotional story of a domesticated animal.  Overall this book had its ups and downs of emotional twist and turns, it equally distributed the uplifting and depressing parts throughout the chapters.  The parts of the story that I have presented to you are just snippets of an extraordinary book.

As Christian parents, we were intentional about teaching our kids the love the Lord and the Bible.  We made our Christian principles an important part of our live and exposed our children to all aspects.  For parents today who want some guidance in this area, this new book is wonderful.

The Comers share from their own experience of parenting their children.  In addition, they have some specific and attainable guidelines to apply to all ages of child rearing.  Together, these make it understandable and doable for all parents today.

My favorite parts are the personal examples which make the guidelines seem attainable.  This would make a wonderful book to include in a baby gift at the next baby shower.

Problems with this book:

The character development.......wait sorry, there wasn't any.

Unpredictable.....nope totally knew from ninth chapter what was going to happen.

Throne of Glass meets Game of Thrones; with the dull characters of Twilight and a pathetic attempt at X-Men origins. To the authors credit, she created a female main character no one will like. I found myself rooting against Mave and here brooding.

I found Prince Joffrey and Robb Stark have a lot in common with Maven and Cal. Bella and Mave have a lot of personalitytraits. Both plain and brooding. At least Hunger Games, Luna Chronicles, Throne of Glass series,  Shatter Me, Carnival and City of Bones have likeable female characters.

I enjoyed the concept and build up. But, I refuse to read another book in this series. If Victoria Aveyard ran with her story instead, it'd be worth the extra read. This book left me frustrated and annoyed.

29583,2259,115,"This book will be added to my all time favorite WWII list of books. Extremely well done. The setting is the small village of Vergers on the Normandy Coast of France. The story leads up to D-Day, June 5, 1944. The story seems so simple on the surface, but it is well crafted and deceptively profound. We meet the villagers all beaten down, suffering, and barely getting by under Nazi Occupation. The protagonist, Emma becomes the town baker when the Jewish man who was her boss, is hauled away to a concentration camp. She lives with her grandmother, Meme, who seems to be getting a bit senile. Goat is the name a man who Emma attended school with who now she can't seem to stand, though she allows him to live in her pig shed. Pierre is a farmer with the last few cows left in the village. Fleur and her mother are what's left of the veterinarian's family after the Nazis killed him as the village looked on. There are so many more villagers, the Argents and their baby Gabrielle (wealthy Parisians who own a large villa on the coast) Monkey Boy (who seems like a simpleton, but might be autistic) Odette (owner of the village restaurant stuck catering to the Nazis), Margeurite (owner of the tobacco shop), Maria (who might be the village tart giving favors to the Nazis) and the Monsignor (trying to save the souls of the villagers). They are all tied together by what they all have to offer and what they all need.

29591,843,3786,"I seem to be swimming against the tide again in my reaction to another new HR release. I thought to try out Linden's new series, even though her previous Scandals books did not appeal to me. But this one goes into the same file as Kleypas' and Campbell's latest novels. It's competently written but Linden and the other two are not one third the wordsmiths of a Meredith Duran, Jayne Fresina, Elizabeth Kingston, Sherry Thomas, or Courtney Milan. Linden tells stories, but the way she writes never blows me away with its cleverness, lyrical prose, or great dialogue. And the plot of this one is predictable and derivative, with uninspired characters from Central Casting.

As heroine we have poor orphaned Sophie Graham, who has to struggle to make it on her own in the world, since her parents are both deceased and her grandfather agreed only to pay her education and after that she was not to count on him for anything. Fortunately, she learned her way around cards and gaming from her father (disowned by her grandfather because of his mesalliance with a French opera singer) and knows how to count cards and other card sharp tricks. With a goal of accumulating enough funds to retire within six years, Sophie frequents Vega Club, one of the few gambling clubs open to women gamblers.

Our hero is Jack Lindeville, Duke of Ware. Jack is fully cognizant of his duties and responsibilities as a peer of the realm and is a sober, reliable, perhaps slightly stick-up-his-patootie person. But there's a thorn in his side: irresponsible younger brother Philip, who has taken to losing scads of money gambling inexpertly at that Vega Club frequented by Sophie.

When Jack goes to the club to pay off Philip's debts, who should he find there but Philip, flirting with a lovely woman gambler. Jack is peeved, to say the least. First, Philip was not supposed to gamble any more and second, it appears that that hussy is encouraging him to lose more money. To discourage this, Jack makes a bet with her: 5000 pounds of his against her spending one week with him. She accepts. And loses. And that's pretty much the story. They go off together to one of Jack's lesser estates and are appropriately trapped there by heavy rains, impassable roads, and a broken carriage axle.

Naturally they have the hots for each other. Naturally they both know nothing can really come of it. She wants respectability and marriage. He wants her in his bed but knows she's not respectable enough to be his wife. But, of course, they cannot deny their great sexual attraction and continue their clandestine affair once they have returned to London. Then comes that predictable quandary: marriage or mistress.

There's also a minor snafu with a supposed longstanding betrothal of Jack to another young woman, something that did not need to be there except, I guess, because otherwise there would not have been enough pages in the book.

What little plot there was here did not entertain me. It was too been-there, done-that. And I had so many problems with the actions of these characters.

(1) Why on earth did Sophie agree to that wager? How could she possibly think that this would stay in the club and not get out into the gossiping ton? This wasn't Vegas, where what happens there, stays there. For a woman who needed to stay respectable, she wasn't very smart.

(2) Why did Sophie start out as such a strong female and then turn into a silly puddle around Jack? I dislike women who become weak around a handsome man. He wasn't even all that pleasant to her when she first felt this attraction.

(3) Why did the author feel the need to add in the plot line with Jack's longtime implied engagement? It was needless filler that produced a Trite Misunderstanding that added nothing to the plot but annoyed the heck out of me. And more to the point: Why didn't Sophie go to Jack to get this clarified instead of talking to that idiot Philip?

(4) Why was Jack so ineffectual in his dealings with his brother? How could he be so poor at controlling his gambling? And his plan to follow Philip around Vega Club was ridiculous.

(5) Why did we have that predictable bit at the end with Sophie meeting up with the new Viscount Makepeace? That watered down the whole ""I'm going to marry you no matter who you are"" from Jack.

And, as long as I am being such an annoying gritch here, I've got a couple lesser things to complain about: (1) Why not ""vingt-et-un""? Isn't that more correct than ""vingt-un""? and (2) Why would a duke use a hackney to get home from Vega Club? Wouldn't that be too vulgar and common? Shouldn't a duke move around in his own ducal carriage?

Okay. I'm done venting.

I was totally mesmerized by the story of Florrie and her little sister Rosie, poor orphaned flower sellers in London's Covent Garden in 1912. What a dreadful life those poor girls led. I enjoyed learning about Tilly Harper, the young girl who came down from the Lake District to work in the home/orphanage for the flower girls started by the benevolent Mr. Shaw to help the flower girls live a decent, productive life. I found myself fully transported to another time and place with Ms. Gaynor's wonderfully, luscious, descriptive writing.

29595,3535,3003,"All major research studies of worker satisfaction indicate that feeling that they and their work are appreciated is ranked among at or near the top of what is most important to them. What about compensation? It is ranked between #9 and #12, depending on which study is involved. Of course, there are also bills to be paid so what people earn is a reasonable consideration.

This is whatLeah Weiss has in mind in this passage: ""What many people don't realize is that two goals -- a paycheck and a sense of purpose -- need not be mutually exclusive. And yet many if us 'are not engaged' or worse -- truly suffering. The paradox is that being mindful of our experience of work, even to our dissatisfaction, disengagement, and ambivalence, is the first step toward turning it around. Indeed, paying attention to our feelings is the very definition of mindfulness.""

She then observes: ""Prototype, experimentation, and informed redesign -- the contemporary Western system for innovative thinking known as 'design thinking' that is de rigueur all over Silicon Valley -- has a surprising analog in a two-thousand-year-old Tibetan system called darma sum. Literally, and rather poetically,darma sum means 'good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end.' This three-part mindfulness training instruction applies to everything we do or want to do. Not coincidentally, I think, both design thinking anddarma sum trace the basic structure of another famous learning strategy: the hypothesis, experimentation, and conclusion of the scientific method.""

As I think about all this, I am again reminded of how the mind (what the brain does) can be developed -- over time -- to integrate reason, intuition, and emotion with the five senses in ways and to an extent that artificial intelligence cannot equal, much less surpass.

These are among the dozens of other passages that also caught my eye, shared to suggest the scope of Weiss's coverage:

o Skills: Soft vs. Hard (Pages 29-33)
o Three Kinds of Mindfulness (42-61)
o Meta-Cognition (52-59)
o Purpose Makes Your Job More Satisfying (66-70)
o Purpose Makes Us Healthier (71-75)
o Articulating Your Purpose (82-87)
o Radical Prioritization (90-94)
o What Is Compassion? (99-110)
o Connecting across Differences (116-121)
o What Is Self-Compassion? (125-140)
o Self-Compassion and Self-Esteem (143-146)
o Managing Emotions: What Doesn't Work (152-159)
o Mindfulness Strategies for Emotional Regulation (162-166)
o What Is Reflection? (179-1870
o Elements of Courage (204-215)
o Managerial Moral Courage (216-222)
o Leader-Initiated Approaches (227-252)

I am also commend Weiss on her skillful use of Mini-Commentaries as well as ""Accomplish This"" interactive exercises throughout include:

o Define Your Purpose (Page 70)
o Practicing Compassion Toward Others (108-109)
o Accelerator Moment (136-137)
o Self-Compassion (142-143)
o Identify the Ladder of Inference (161-162)
o Walking Meditation (166-167)
o Quick Ways to Access Mindfulness at Work (171-172)
o Change Your Interpretation (180-181)
o Applying Reflection Practices (197-198)
o Taking Inventory of Fear (207-208
o Staying on Track (214-215)
o Motivating with Purpose (219)
o Cultivating Responsibility (223)

At one point, Weiss observes: ""Prototype, experimentation, and informed redesign -- the contemporary Western system for innovative thinking known as 'design thinking' that is de rigueur all over Silicon Valley -- has a surprising analog in a two-thousand-year-old Tibetan system called darma sum. Literally, and rather poetically,darma sum means 'good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end.'

It would be an excellent idea to have a lined notebook near at hand while reading this book in order to record questions, comments, and page references as well as completing various exercises. Doing this will facilitate, indeed expedite frequent review of key material later.

Obviously, no brief commentary such as mine could possibly do full justice to the abundance of information, insights, and counsel that is provided in this book. However, I hope I have at least indicated why I think so highly of Leah Weiss and her work. I agree with her: ""The path to productivity and success is not to change jobs, to compartmentalize our feelings, or to create a false 'professional' identity but rathe to listen to the wisdom of our feelings offer.""",1520899200,5,major research studi worker satisfact indic feel work appreci rank among near top import compens rank 9 12 depend studi involv cours also bill paid peopl earn reason consider whatleah wei mind passag mani peopl dont realiz two goal paycheck sen purpos need mutual exclus yet mani u engag wors truli suffer paradox mind experi work even dissatisfact disengag ambival first step toward turn around inde pay attent feel definit mind observ prototyp experiment inform redesign contemporari western system innov think known design think de rigueur silicon valley surpris analog twothousandyearold tibetan system call darma sum liter rather poeticallydarma sum mean good begin good middl good end threepart mind train instruct appli everyth want coincident think design think anddarma sum trace basic structur anoth famou learn strategi hypothesi experiment conclus scientif method think remind mind brain develop time integr reason intuit emot five sen way extent artifici intellig cannot equal much le surpass among dozen passag
29596,2233,3830,"I read Ms. Mackintoshs book I Let You Go  and enjoyed it. I was looking forward to another great read in Let Me Lie. Although some reviewers seem to be disappointed in this book I liked it. Heres why:

The story is told from multiple points of view which is always interesting and since one of the narrators is not identified I found it that much more enticing.

The writing is very good. It flowed well and kept me reading. It had plenty of twists and lots of lies, lots and lots of lies!  The main character, Anna Johnson, is well described. She is a young woman dealing with the deaths of both of her parents, a new baby and a still developing relationship with the babys father. I may have wanted her to handle some of the situations differently but, hey, this is a story. She is just beginning to heal when she receives an anonymous note which suggests that perhaps her parents deaths were not by suicide, as they had been ruled by the police investigation but something else.

When Anna calls the police it is an answered by a retired police detective, Murray, who still works at the station at the desk for incoming calls, etc. Though he is no longer licensed to take on a case he has a suspicion about this one and decides that he can at least get some information to pass along to the detectives. He gets more and more involved and we learn a lot about his character and his own family life. His wife has been battling mental illness all of her life and has been in and out of hospital and psych wards throughout their marriage, he never gives up on her. I couldn't help but love this character who, in spite of his own pressing problems, continues to try to help Anna.

There are other characters as well who could possibly be involved in a cover up, or a part of a crime committed. There is her partner, Mark, a psychologist, who appears loving and cares about Anna and baby Ella and wants to marry her but how much does she really know about him? There is her uncle Billy who, along with Anna, inherited the auto business that her parents started. She has a very good friend named Laura who also lost her mother a few years back. Dr. Drake is a next door neighbor who always seems to be a bit too interested in what is going on at the Johnson house.

I liked the book and the notes from the author afterward. She wanted not only to write a thriller but to also convey a message about suicides. She states According to the charity MIND, 1 in 4 of us will experience mental health problems this year and more than 25% of us admit to having had suicidal thoughts at some point in our lives. I don't know how much more research backs up these numbers but I know that there are lots of suicides committed every year and perhaps some may have been prevented if someone noticed the signs of depression or mental illness in their loved ones, friends or family and reached out a helping hand. I applaud her in trying to bring awareness to this subject.

I received an ARC from the publisher through NetGalley, thank you.",1520899200,4,read m mackintosh book let go enjoy look forward anoth great read let lie although review seem disappoint book like here stori told multipl point view alway interest sinc one narrat identifi found much entic write good flow well kept read plenti twist lot lie lot lot lie main charact anna johnson well describ young woman deal death parent new babi still develop relationship babi father may want handl situat differ hey stori begin heal receiv anonym note suggest perhap parent death suicid rule polic investig someth el anna call polic answer retir polic detect murray still work station desk incom call etc though longer licens take case suspicion one decid least get inform pas along detect get involv learn lot charact famili life wife battl mental ill life hospit psych ward throughout marriag never give couldnt help love charact
29597,950,3830,"Anna Johnson is still reeling from the suicide of her father, Tom, when her mother, Caroline, dies as well, in a suicide that copies that of Tom's. A year later, Anna is grief-stricken, parenting a young baby, and trying to put together the pieces of her life. She lives in her parents' old home, surrounded by memories of their life together. On the anniversary of her mother's death, Anna receives a suspicious note that prompts her to dig into her parents' past and their deaths. She quickly discovers that nothing is as it seems--not their suicides, nor the happy childhood memories she holds so dear.

I really love Clare Mackintosh; her first novel, I Let You Go, is one of my favorites, and she's one of those authors I follow on Twitter and find very relatable. So I was very excited to finally get a chance to read this one. I'm still in awe of Mackintosh--who spent twelve years in the police force--and her writing talent. She has such a talent for creating some of her characters. And boy, can she really shock you with a plot twist.

I must first preface that if you have issues or triggers with suicide, this might be one to skip. Having lost a loved one to suicide, I can tell you that this can be a little hard to read. But Mackintosh treats the subject very delicately; she also presents us with a character with BPD, and I thought her treatment of mental illness was very well-done.

The novel is told mainly from Anna's point of view and that of a former police detective, Murray, who gets involved with her case. We do get snippets from someone else--we are left to imagine to try to figure out who it is, when they are speaking, and what has happened to them. Once Anna receives the note questioning her mother's suicide, she takes it to the police, where Murray--an investigator/detective now relegated to desk duty post-retirement--starts looking into it, which is a bit against the rules. This doesn't matter to us, because unless you have no heart, you'll immediately love Murray. He was the star of the story, to me, and I immediately adored him. He's also a great detective and a wonderful force in the book. (Can we have another story with Murray, please, Ms. Mackintosh?)

The book is ominous, creepy, and and tense, as the story slowly builds to its conclusion. It's not a fast-paced thriller, per se, but I was definitely fascinated in what had happened to Anna's parents. I was kept guessing for good chunks of the book, which I certainly appreciated. There are a bunch of twists and turns, several of which had me quite surprised. I just love how Mackintosh can throw you off track and then shock you quite convincingly.

For me, part of this book was a little far-fetched, and I thought Anna acted a little odd at times -- though in her defense, the poor girl is put through a lot. The book is best if you roll with the surprises and just enjoy them. Even better, you have Murray, who offers a touching character (his interactions with his wife are beyond lovely and show a deftness in writing that is quite impressive) as well as superbly-written detective. The book was compelling; nearing the end, I kept going ""what? what did he find? who?!"" so I know it was effective in creating suspense. It's also creepy at times and surprising until the end. Well-done. 4+ stars.

""We hunt one another. But don't let the media fool you. Were no worse than anywhere else. Like everywhere, like everyone, we simply want to be happy. This is our truth. We hunt for hope. Dont you?""

You know those books you think you'll like but your also not really sure about them? That's what this book was for me. I was hoping to like it but wasn't really sure because I hadn't been hearing much about it.
As I started reading Nothing Left to Burn I immediately started loving it and new it was going to be nothing like a sweet little contemporary book that has a girl escaping from a fire like the cover leads you to believe.
This book is so much more than that. Audrey is a sixteen-year-old young woman who is an ex-ballerina in a relationship with an older boy (Brooks), and has a young sister who has beat lymphoma twice!

""My dancing was the levity. I was the healthy daughter, the strength. It was essential that I succeed. If Maya couldn't dance, I would dance for her.""

The sister is now the one doing ballet and is following in Audrey's footsteps before she stopped dancing. Dancing is kind of what held them all together all these years and is now a bit of a tension in the family for Audrey.
That's not what this book is about though, this book is about Audrey and Brooks and fire.
Brook while being older is also very mysterious in a darkish way. Despite these two being together for a few months, they don't really know a lot about each other's past. Which is kind of a good thing, and a bad thing as we find out things with Audrey.

This book jumps around from the past few months and present time and what Audrey is doing when it comes to getting away from the fire.

Overall I really did love this book. At times it was a little hard to read because of the things happening and how Audrey was feeling about them. Which is something I love about this book because we do see what Audrey's feeling and she admit's to not liking things and feel uncomfortable doing certain things. This was so nice to see mentioned in a YA book especially one that deals with relationships and figuring out who you are and what you want to do with the rest of your life. I love Audrey's friends and how supportive of her they were and how they didn't let a certain someone stop them from hanging out still.

I just really loved this book and I don't want to say too much and take away from you enjoying it and loving it.

29600,3564,3870,"Sixteen year old Audrey Harper is forced to evacuate her family's home after a wildfire in Orange County, California threatens to spread into her gated Coto de Coza neighborhood. While awaiting word whether or not her family's home will be safe, Audrey looks back on her relationship with Brooks, a troubled volunteer firefighter. While she feels a strong connection with him that she has never experienced before she can't help but wonder if there is more to Brooks' past. With the fire threatening to destroy so much already, will her relationship with Brooks be able to withstand the intensity?

This book was certainly intense and definitely shows that even teenagers in high school deal with real issues and high school relationships can be just as meaningful as the ones you have later in life. I liked the alternating timelines and enjoyed reading about how the things in the past led to what was happening in the present time.

29601,2033,3830,"Thank you to Netgalley and Sphere for a copy of the eARC in exchange for a fair review.

Anna is still reeling from the grief, her father committed suicide and then seven months later her mother did as well. Anna met Mark, her husband at a grief counseling session. Now they are together and living in her parents old house. She has a baby and all is well except she just can't understand why her parents killed themselves.

Then Anna recieves an odd postcard in the mail, it says Suicide? Think again! She knows something is going on and so she goes into the police station and talks to the desk sgt. Murray listens to what she asks, and decides to look into the case and find evidence of the murders Anna believes happened before he takes it to CID.

Anna is consumed by finding the answers until the day she finds a brick thrown into the window of her daughter's room telling her no police leave it alone. She wonders what is really going on and if the people who killed her parents are after her.

Sadly I must leave it at there because spoilers. Whew what a book, Clare Mackintosh is becoming a go to author for me. I have read all three of her books and I love them. She is so masterful in her twists. This one I thought I was on top of it when I guessed a couple of them before they happened, but the rest of that I did not see coming. Like I want to rave about some things, but I can't because spoilers.

I hate that I want too, no I need to talk about this book and get all of my thoughts and feelings out. Needless to say that Anna wasn't surrounded by the best people.

29602,1467,3870,"What a gorgeous, frightening, beautifully spun story. The title is perfect: the fire metaphor ends up playing a huge part in the story, and not just because a Southern California wildfire is advancing toward Audrey's home (the story begins with the firemen pounding on her door, telling her she has to evacuate). Ezell cranks up the heat in other, more subtle ways: there is something so compelling about the instant attraction between her and Brooks, yet something dangerous about it, too. Kind of like staring at a campfire, being mesmerized by its beauty... but when you reach out to touch the orange flame, it burns.

The writing is luscious, the characters are richly drawn (I was a huge fan of Maya, Audrey's younger sister), and the plotting is tight: as the fire grew closer and closer, Audrey gets closer and closer to the truth, and I found myself unable to put the book down for the second half. The themes Ezell explores are complex and interesting. Do we ever really know the people we fall in love with? Can something that once lit us up destroy us in the end?

29610,4582,3830,"I have a very short list of must-read mystery/thriller-suspense authors, but I would say Mackintosh is at the top. She made me a fan with I Let You Go, and her two follow ups have solidified my fangirl status.

As with Mackintosh's previous works, I found myself fully engrossed in the story, and was pleasantly surprised by some really great twists. However, this one was a little different in that it elicited tears from me. These were not tears due to fear, but honest to goodness sad tears. I think it had a lot to due with the author delving into a lot of relationship issues, as well as mental health issues.

Mackintosh also made me fall in love with one of the characters - Murray. Murray was just the sweetest, most big-hearted guy. I am getting tears in my eyes just thinking about what a beautiful person he was. The way he loved his wife was very special. I sort of wish Mackintosh would have given him a little better ending, because I just adored him.

I am a fan of Mackintosh's writing and her storytelling. This book had a bunch of really great plot twists, and the ending!!! I just love it when something comes out of nowhere like that. Another thing I really thought was well done, was the use of a third POV. I wasn't sure who it belonged to. I thought I knew, but I wasn't sure. What I will say is that it added some extra tension and mystery to the story, and kept me wondering, which is alway fun when it comes to this type of story. This story starts really strong, but then builds slowly from there. My patience had a big payoff though, and some of those reveals were well worth the wait.

Overall: Another solid suspense-thriller from Mackintosh, which was packed with some gasp-worthy twists, some heart pounding events, and heart-tugging moments.",1520899200,4,short list mustread mysterythrillersuspens author would say mackintosh top made fan let go two follow up solidifi fangirl statu mackintosh previou work found fulli engross stori pleasantli surpris realli great twist howev one littl differ elicit tear tear due fear honest good sad tear think lot due author delv lot relationship issu well mental health issu mackintosh also made fall love one charact murray murray sweetest bigheart guy get tear eye think beauti person way love wife special sort wish mackintosh would given littl better end ador fan mackintosh write storytel book bunch realli great plot twist end love someth come nowher like anoth thing realli thought well done use third pov wasnt sure belong thought knew wasnt sure say ad extra tension mysteri stori kept wonder alway fun come type stori stori start realli strong build slowli patienc big payoff though reveal well worth
29611,368,3830,"Clare Mackintosh, you have officially given me my first Book Hangover of 2018!

Last year I enjoyed Mackintosh's suspense read, I See You. So, last week, when the publisher sent me surprise book mail with this title, I jumped at the chance to dig into it before its publication date (my reaction 'may have' included a happy dance).

The overall feeling of this book is a slow, tantalizing building of tension and intrigue with twists thrown in to keep readers on their toes. Mackintosh provides many viable culprits and an overall story arc that slowly takes hold of the reader until they're sneaking off for 'just one more chapter'. I had several hypotheses about what was going on but the only thing I suspected correctly was that Mackintosh would pull the rug out from under me with a few final twists.

The story is told using multiple points of view and this approach worked well to build the tension and give readers insight into characters' motivations. Both the main and secondary characters have enough depth and backstory to keep things interesting and I couldn't help but have a soft spot for the investigating officer, Murray McKenzie, and his complicated relationship with his wife.

Mackintosh has 12 years experience on a British police force, including time in the Criminal Investigation Department, and this experience shows in the details. She also examines some big issues with sensitivity while blending these issues deftly within her overall plot.

This gripping, psychological thriller is a complex, intriguing web of lies and deceit that will lead readers on a wild path and keep them reading well past their bedtimes. You've simply got to read this book.

29614,834,3830,"My Review of ""Let Me Lie"" by Clare Mackintosh

Kudos to Clare Mackintosh, Author of ""Let Me Lie"" for writing such a captivating and intense psychological thriller. The author describes her characters as complex and complicated. There are dark deep secrets, betrayals, and lies, pathological lies.  The only thing is, that you won't see them coming. There are twists and turns. There are characters that you know are suspect of something, or not.

Anna Johnson, has just given birth to an infant baby girl. It is now the Anniversary of her  Parent's deaths. It is an extremely anxious, depressing and emotional time for Anna.

The Blurb from NetGalley says:

""The Police say it was suicide.  Anna says is was murder. They're both wrong""

As a new mother, Anna wants to know the truth about  what really happened to her parents. Or does she?  Mysterious things start to happen as a warning to STOP. These are dangerous things. Someone or Someones want things to just stay as they are............ or else!!!!

I was close to half-way through when I thought I might give up on Let Me Lie, but she pulled out the big guns and I had to see Anna's story through to the end. It's not that the story was boring, or the characters non-relatable, there just wasn't anything that drew me in until a big plot twist happened and I had no choice but to keep going. This is one suspense where I didn't see the surprises coming and I thought I had it all figured out. There wasn't anything to give away the ending and I love that Clare Mackintosh pulls the hood over my eyes before shattering my assumptions. I enjoyed reading Let Me Lie, but overall I'd have to say that it wasn't as consuming as I See You and seems less like a thriller and more of a suspenseful mystery.

29616,666,3830,"Let Me Lie by Clare Mackintosh is a standalone thriller, which the author has become known for after her successful debut with I Let You Go.

Let Me Lie revolves around Anna Johnson, who lives with her partner, Mark and their baby, Ella.  Anna is still grieving over the death by suicide of her mother, which was a year ago. Her father also killed himself around 7 months prior to her mothers death.  Anna just cant get past the fact that both of her parents died the same way.  On the day of the anniversary of her mothers death, she receives an anonymous note questioning that their deaths were suicide, which convinces Anna that both of them were murdered.

She goes to the police with the note, and a retired cop, who works at the police desk takes the note and says he will look into it.  Besides Anna, we also get the Pov of the cop, Murray, who upon researching the case, begins to believe she is right, that her parents were murdered.  Murray was a good cop, and we also get to see him with his wife, who fights off mental illness.  On her good days, she helps discuss the case with him, and this was a nice element to the story and investigation.

As Anna is determined to find the truth, she will receive a shock that will change the game.  To say too much more would be spoilers, and throughout the book, there are so many twists and surprises that will further change everything.  There are a number of other characters who are part of Annas life; Mark, her partner, who wants to marry her; Laura, who is a friend to the family; Billy, her uncle from her fathers side.  Who can Anna trust?

What follows is an exciting and intense story that bordered a bit on the wild side with all those twists and turns. Anna, the main character all the way through, was in the middle of every revelation, that by the end, her own life was very much in danger.  At the same time, the story took a bit of an unrealistic feel, though it was very much a thriller.

Let Me Lie was a dark thriller, lots of excitement, action  and game changers that made you constantly guess wrong, especially since for the most part, the other characters could not really be trusted.

29617,2147,3830,"Let Me Lie by Clare Mackintosh is a suspenseful mystery about a young woman who begins to suspect her parents suicides may have been murder.

Anna Johnson is living in her family home with her partner Mark Hemmings and their two month old daughter, Ella.  On the one year anniversary of her mother Carolines suicide, she receives a card that makes her think her parents deaths might be murder instead of suicide. Taking her suspicions to the local police, retired CID officer Murray Mackenzie who is now a civilian desk clerk, decides to re-examine the closed cases on his own. When Annas family is threatened and she makes a shocking discovery, she tries to convince Murray to end his investigation, but he has uncovered information that might support her murder theory.

In her mid-twenties, Anna is trying to move on from her parents deaths and she is coping well enough until the one year anniversary of her mums suicide. She was quite close to her parents, only leaving home long enough to go to university. She is also close to her uncle Billy and her mums goddaughter Laura. Annas pregnancy was unintended but she is embracing motherhood although she is reluctant to say yes to Marks marriage proposals.

Murray truly enjoyed his career but he wanted to retire on his own terms. He is married to his beloved wife Sarah whose lifelong struggle with mental illness has also included numerous inpatient stays in psychiatric facilities. With Sarah currently in hospital, Murray quietly looks into Tom and Carolines suicides and he is puzzled by a few details from the original investigations.  Since he is a civilian employee now, he must rely on his instincts and good old fashioned detective work to examine the cases. Murray still has a few friends on the force who are willing to do him a few favors when he needs a little extra help.  Murray quickly concludes that Annas parents deaths are most likely foul play, but he is puzzled by her insistence he end his investigation.

Unfolding from Annas, Murrays and an unknown persons perspectives,  Let Me Lie is an engrossing mystery.  The characters are engaging and well-developed although some are more likable than others. It is virtually impossible to guess the unknown narrators identity and this persons passages are a little dark and somewhat chilling. The novel is divided into three parts and each of them have plenty of twists and turns.  Clare Mackintosh brings the novel to a breathless, action packed conclusion that wraps up all of the various threads and with one final, jaw-dropping revelation, the story comes to a stunning  finale.

Happy Publishing Day to Let Me Lie!

Going into this book I had seen some reviews, mostly positive and some say this book may not be as good as Mackintosh's other ones. However, this was my first one by her and it did not disappoint.

We meet Anna and learn that her parents have committed suicide within a year of each other. She can't figure out why. They seemed happy. They were a happy family...right? Anna is also a mother to a young child and is in a relationship with her previous therapist. She's sad because neither of her parents are with her to help her raise her newborn child or even to meet the child. She has her uncle, her friend Laura and Mark but it can be hard losing your parents and having it be unknown. Anna starts to get threats and this is where the story starts to take off..

On the other end we meet Detective Mackenzie. Usually detectives don't have a large story line but I emotionally connected with Murray Mackenzie on many levels. He loved his job, he loved his wife (she had a lot of her own problems) and he had a police force that loved him so. The ending for him was such a roller coaster but in my opinion he was the real MVP of this book.

Man does this book unfold. After reading so many mysteries and thrillers I've learned to suspect everyone who you met in a book because more often then not it's some you least expect. I really thought I had this one figured out and I ended up being so wrong but it such a good way.

This book started out at a gallop, then slowed to a trot and finally ended with a sprint to the finish.

Clara Mayfield is desperate, after helping her sister elope and dragging her family into scandal, she has finishing the season with no prospects until the vile Baron Rutherford asks for her hand. Clara would rather be a spinster than marry the Baron, but her nouveau riche parents long to be accepted by the ton and will not listen to her protests, leaving her no choice but to run away.

With the help of her maid she finds a position in the home of the reclusive William Halstead, the Earl of Ashworth. William has sequestered himself away in the county since the death of his father, older brother and brother in law. He suffers from flashbacks and panic attacks since the accident that claimed his loved ones and has no desire to be part of society. But when he meets Clara, while saving her life, he feels alive for the first time in almost two years. He walks away from her and is shocked and disappointed when she is at his home applying for a position in his under staffed household. At first he refuses to hire her, but finally agrees to a probationary period, he asks her name and she tells him her name is Helen.

For me the story really slowed down at this point, there is not a lot of interaction with Clara/Helen and William, it is mostly Helen the housemaid trying to fit in with the ""below stairs"" employees and her relationship with his niece, Rosa. While the scenes with William are sparse and fleeting, there is an undeniable attraction between them, but they never spent enough time together for me to believe there was any real connection between them.

The story progresses slowly and there are a lot of characters to keep track of, but when the author begins to wrap up the story, it gains a second wind and takes off like a rocket. And when Clara's past finally catches up with her, will William be able to forgive her deceit?

I thought this was a decent debut, the writing is a bit on the wordy side and the relationship between William and Clara could have used a bit more development, there were also some inconsistencies and one glaring title error (which is not that bad considering there were several titled characters in the book). But overall, the story was good and I think with time this author will be a strong voice in the HR genre.

I liked the kids in the story (although the bully was truly awful - not for what he did so much as what he BELIEVED and how that made him treat others).

29631,2592,3790,"Historical Romance is often a genre I forget that I absolutely adore until Ive jumped back in, and Hello Stranger was just the one to remind me of that. Both smartly written and tightly structured, it had the perfect blend of charmingly witty characters to keep it interesting and light while maintaining a forward-moving plot of steamy romance and cloak-and-dagger intrigue.

Garrett was a strong-willed heroine possessing the brains and unshakable gumption of a woman not of her century, and she truly came alive on the pages. I admired her mind and force of will to be a physician in a time when men didn't allow it, and how she managed to still have the ability and strength to show vulnerability to those closest to her. But it wasn't just that; it was that stubborn fire in her that refused to be cowed even when confronted with opposition. Her connection with Ethan was fed from that part of her, and watching him fall for that fire was magnificent. He was a rare man for that timehis openness of his attraction to her and his need to protect and not stifle just to name a fewand his want for her to succeed made it so easy to fall for him. Kleypas portrayal of the her medical professiondepicted brilliantly and effortlesslyencapsulated the reader into Garretts world and her everyday life with aplomb. It was so seamlessly woven into her character that I was ravenous to follow along and watch her work. I daresay that Garrett was a rare heroine to come across and I couldn't help but love every bit of how she was written.

Im embarrassed to admit this was my first Lisa Kleypas book (even though I own many of her books), and Ive come to realize that Ive been missing out on a fantastic writer and storyteller. Hello Strangers boldly beautiful romance and enigmatic suspense had me glued to its pages, and I didn't want it to end. Though it stands on its own, I look forward to reading the ones before it and continuing on with this series. This is a writer and story not to miss.

29638,1969,3830,"How far should you trust your own judgment? You sense things, you see things, they call it a post-bereavement hallucinatory experience.  Logically you know what you are experiencing cannot be true since your parents are dead, that it is not rational to see your mothers ghost standing across the street or to smell her perfume in your kitchen.  So why is this all happening now, a year later, when it did not happen immediately after their deaths?

Annas father jumped off the cliff at Beachy Head, seven months later, in apparent desperation, her mother copied her husbands suicide.  Now on the first anniversary of her mothers death, someone is playing a cruel joke and has sent Anna a note, Suicide? Think again.  Is it possible the one or both of them had been murdered?

Annas partner, and once her therapist, Mark Hemmings is trying to convince her that it is just a hoax, but Anna isn't so sure.  Between her own emotions and the sleep deprivation that their daughter is causing, Annas head is swimming with possibilities, and fears, since she cannot get anyone to believe her, and the strange goings on, that confront her at every turn.  This is where retired detective Murray Mackenzie steps in and takes it upon himself to unofficially investigate.  With his wife in and out of a mental institution and her surprising insight on the case, Murray connects the dots in a way that has the reader scratching their head and thinking  that just might work.

As you read this book, you are certain how it is going to end.  Psychology thrillers tend to lead you down a path that shifts and veers, but there are always truths that remain.

29640,132,1884,"Africa is a continent with a long, troubled history of violence, apartheid, colonialism, and poverty... and sadly, it's a history many outside Africa are all too willing to ignore or forget.  The Western world has not been kind to Africa, to put it lightly, and the countries and territories of this beautiful but treacherous land will bear the scars of occupation and exploitation for a long time to come.  Barbara Kingsolver's novel, ""The Poisonwood Bible,"" pulls few punches in describing just how Western interference has upset the lives of the people of the Congo (now two separate countries, one briefly bearing the name of Zaire for a time), and its characters come to Africa with the hopes of ""bettering"" the lives of the people... only to be taught harsh lessons along the way.  It's a powerful, gut-wrenching read, and one I'm glad I read even if it was horrifying at times.

""The Poisonwood Bible"" follows the Price family as the travel to the Belgium-occupied Congo in the early '60s to do missionary work.  Baptist preacher Nathan Price rules his wife and four daughters with an iron fist and expects to bring salvation and enlightenment to the village where he has been assigned... but Africa has harsh lessons in store for him and his family.  As the Prices face starvation, wild animals, the mistrust of their neighbors, and the sudden independence of the Congo that will plunge the newfound country into decades of violence and political upheaval, the quiet but determined Orleanna Price and her four daughters -- vain and sophisticated Rachel, devoted but studious Leah, physically handicapped but mentally gifted Adah, and young and curious Ruth May -- find themselves being deeply changed by the very country they've set out to civilize and tame.  But whether the changes are for the better or the worse -- and whether any of them will leave Africa alive, let alone unscathed -- remains to be seen...

Barbara Kingsolver tells a fascinating tale that weaves together five distinct different voices -- no small feat for a writer.  Every female member of the Price family has sections narrated from their point of view, and it's fascinating to see all their different takes on the events of the novel.  And while some characters are definitely more likable than others (Rachel comes across as a spoiled brat, while Adah's fatalistic, cynical outlook can wear down the reader), they all have their own unique outlooks on Africa and its people, as well as the trials they undergo.  And all five women are complex characters in their own right, flawed but with their own strengths that will ultimately determine whether they make it or not in this dangerous new land.  It might have been interesting to see a few sections narrated by the father of the family, as he comes across as a relatively shallow character by comparison, but then, it might have been difficult to fit in any more character viewpoints.

The book itself is set during actual historical events, and even if most of these happen in the background, they still ultimately impact the novel in powerful ways.  This book is not only a tale of struggling to survive and adapt in an unforgiving new world, but of the dangers of meddling in the affairs of another culture, and in trying to force our ways on a country and a people not suited to them.  It's a very anti-colonialism novel, and while that is bound to upset some people, one can't deny that they'll come away from this novel with some inkling of the damages the Western world has inflicted on Africa in the name of progress, and wondering if said damages were worth the outcome.

This novel left me angry at times, and saddened me... but ultimately it told a story I needed to hear.  And not only does it carry a strong message that needed to be told, it gave a compelling story about how one family undergoes dramatic and heartwrenching changes in a land on the cusp of a political and cultural revolution.

29646,2147,844,"Weaving back and forth between the present, the recent past and diary entries from 1991, Sometimes I Lie by Alice Feeney is a twist-turny, suspenseful novel that is absolutely riveting.

Amber Reynolds is in a coma yet she is aware of what is occurring around her. What she is unclear about is the sequence of events that led up to the coma. As memories begin to come back to her, she is afraid of her husband, Paul, uneasy about her sister Claires presence and terrified of the stranger who keeps showing up in her hospital room. Unable to make sense of these confusing facts, Amber continues to try to remember what happened to her and who is responsible for the accident that left her in a coma.

In the present, Amber tries to piece together the wispy memories and her discordant emotions in an attempt to figure out how she ended up in a coma.  A variety of events taking place around her don't jibe with the facts she remembers so she is extremely puzzled about various happenings.  Her marriage to Paul is a bit strained so is that the reason she is afraid he had something to do with the accident? Claire and Paul do not like one another, so why are they spending so much time together in her hospital room? And even more troubling, why are they actually getting along? But most important, who is the stranger who keeps showing up in her room? Why is Amber so frightened by what he is saying and doing while he is with her?

In the week leading up to the accident, Amber is on the cusp of losing her job at a local radio station. Her relationship with co-worker and popular radio host Madeline Frost is fraught with tension. Luckily for Amber, her good friend Jo helps her devise a plan to tarnish Madelines reputation in order to prevent the disagreeable radio personality from making the threat of job loss a reality.

Already stressed over her job situation, Amber also notices a few inconsistencies with Paul that her make her very suspicious that he might not love her anymore. She is also rather troubled by a few discoveries that make her question whether or not Claire is up to something nefarious but Amber is uncertain whether or not her sister would do something to deliberately hurt her.

The diary entries are written from an eleven year old girls point of view. The young girls family moved around quite a bit but they recently located to help her grandmother who recently passed away. Her home life is quite unhappy due to her parents constant arguing and their excessive drinking. A bright spot in her situation is her recent friendship with a classmate but there are disturbing elements to their friendship that will definitely give readers pause.

Sometimes I Lie is an absolutely spellbinding and suspense-laden mystery that raises many intriguing questions. Is Amber a reliable narrator? As she lies in a coma, can she trust her memories? Can she trust Paul? Have Paul and Claire resolved their longstanding differences and if so, why? Who is the stranger who keeps visiting her and is she right to fear for her safety? As Alice Feeney brings this novel to a jaw-dropping and stunning conclusion, readers will be left wondering whether or not they can trust anyone in this twist-filled page-turner.

Even someone with just a smattering of science and math can appreciate this Nobel Prize winning,  bongo drum playing,  safe cracking denizen of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos.  Here was a man of superior intellect who could yet relate to the world around him and who had a curious interest in many facets of human endeavor.  That is coupled with obvious tenderness toward his first wife,  who dies of TB during the Manhattan Project.

29652,2721,3272,"While at first glance Hollys inclusion as the first female member of her order showed promise for a favorable interpretation of women, the novel sort of undid this work the deeper it went. Hollys superior was tough on her because she was a woman, but she accepted that his unfair treatment of her was just because he wanted her to be great - but this arrangement still resulted in belittling and unfair treatment, instead of the two of them working as allies to overcome a sexist situation.

Then, Juliet Butler was described as attractive... a cook... obsessed with boys and her nails... and unexpectedly good at combat if not for her heritage. No reason was given for her being this way other than her being a girl - and she is depicted also as a character who is incompetent and in need of protecting. In this way she resembled a caricature of a female stereotype more so than an actual developed character with a personality.

By contrast, the most prominent male characters are conniving, aggressive, powerful, and all in some way in charge of the women. It was a really dissatisfying portrayal of women, and to a reader without a critical eye, I think this would reinforce an unfair and unequal concept of women.

Then, the holes.... how could a rough computer translation of an unfamiliar language come out with rhymes? If humans are so much worse at getting along with each other than fairies, why are fairies so often aggressive, rude, and at war?

Despite these critiques, I found the depiction of fairies unique and fun to explore, and the plot kept me reading.

29659,4378,1042,"This book is my favorite from Rick Riordan. It is gripping from the start. The setting stays in the outskirts of New York. The Greek god, Apollo, loses his powers and falls to earth as a puny, 16 year old human.  He immediately comes into trouble because two thugs corner him in an alley. However, a girl named Meg saves him from the thieves trying to take his money.

From that moment, Apollo knew she was special and probably the  daughter of a god. So Apollo takes Meg and brings her to Camp Halfblood, with the help of Percy Jackson. The Jacksons kindly take them, they fall into many  troubles and fights, like with Karpos, and maybe even Megs father! This book flows well into the next one and the Percy Jackson series. I cant wait for you to read this book because, Ive been on the edge of my seat all of winter.

29667,834,844,"My Review of ""Sometimes I Lie"" by Alice Feeney

WOW! Kudos to Alice Feeney , Author of ""Sometimes I Lie"", for the riveting, captivating, intense Psychological Thriller. The timeline of the story deals with mostly the present and the past, and leaves one wondering about the future. Alice Feeney describes her characters as complex and complicated. Some are pathological, and even the narration is told in possibly  unreliable voices.

Amber Reynolds is in a coma in a hospital and tells you three things from the get-go.

""1. I'm in a coma"". 2. My husband doesn't love me anymore. 3. Sometimes I lie.""

The author goes to the past, and brings in diaries of  younger lives, and as we are in the present, we are with Amber as she hears the voices around her, not being able to do anything. How did she get here? Who's was she with? Why did this happen?

As the story progresses, so does the intensity. All of the characters seem to have secrets, and seem to be suspect. There are many twists and turns, and what you think, is questionable. From the beginning to the end, there is tremendous anxiety and tension.

Of course, at the end, I will just say, I said ""OMG!!!!!""  I would highly recommend this book for readers who enjoy a face paced exciting, thrilling, psychological mystery that is hauntingly very  engrossing. I received this Advanced Reading ARC for my honest review.

First person narratives are not my favorite, plus this book jumped around a lot. There was suspense and twists in the book but I just couldn't connect with any of the characters.

29669,229,844,"This book has such good buzz that I was worried I might be disappointed. No need to worry: it is just as good as promised. This is the story of Amber, who wakes up in a coma. We see her life in the past and the present and the way the plot fits together, like a set of Russian dolls, is impressive. There are small clues throughout the novel that plant little seeds for what comes next. Once I read the whole story, it re-wrote itself in my head. The author played with my expectations and subverted everything. Since Amber is in a coma, she must be a clueless victim, right? Well, not to give anything away, but she may be hiding some secrets. Her husband Paul seems way too perfect, he must be a psycho, right? Again, I don't think I even imagined what was going to happen. All the characters break the usual mold of the psychological novels and surprise even the more jaded reader. This is an excellent, tight, well-built and perfectly paced novel.

Amber Reynolds tells her story from her hospital bed where shes in a coma. She can hear the voices of nurses, her husband, and her sister, but she cant react to them in any way. She shares her tale of what happened in the few days leading up to the coma and in the past.

Because she has partial amnesia and is high on drugs, she makes for the ultimate unreliable narrator so you cant figure out what is real and what is scrambled. Once you make it to the end and all the deceptions are unraveled, it makes for an extremely satisfying story.

If you've read the synopsis of this book I'm betting that you're already intrigued. The main character is in a coma, her husband doesn't love her, and we may not be able to trust her! The excitement starts there, but it continues through this whole story. This is a must read for fans of thrillers, and twists.

I really had trouble figuring out the ending and all of the unexpected revelations of this story - and that was a treat! This had short chapters that made the story fly by. It bounced between Amber, our main character, being in a coma but experiencing locked-in syndrome, her life leading up to the coma, and diary entries. This was put together really well.

I didn't know who or what to trust during this story, but it was a great time trying to figure it out. There were lots of layers, but not so many that a reader would have trouble following the story.

29673,4109,844,"Did. Not. See. That. Coming. Wow, talk about being blindsided! I love thrillers and this one hooks you from the beginning as on page one we know the protagonist, Amber is in a coma, believes her husband doesn't love her, and admits to sometimes lying. Told in alternating chapters from ""then,"" ""now"" and often ""before diary entries,""  the novel increases in suspense as Amber tries to piece together the events that led to her hospitalization; we witness her frustration as she is paralyzed, and can't open her eyes or remember much, but is aware of what is going on in the room as she hears her husband and sister talking about her. Feeney deftly weaves together the story of Amber, her family and co-workers and manipulates the reader like putty. I love a good twist, but my head was spinning so much I felt like I was in the Exorcist! Two days later I'm still reeling from the ending! This is a must-read for thriller fans.

There is a pivotal moment where The Big Reveal happens and it STUNNED me. It changed my entire perspective after I had a chance to get over the shock. It's rare that a book does this to me. But The Big Reveal made sense, tied everything together, and quickly moved the story forward.

Amber is an excellent narrator. She likes to tell her stories using three things. This is brilliant. It's easy to remember and sets up the theme of the scenes. The author's writing is very engaging and descriptive. I felt like I was there in the hospital room, hearing Amber's ventilator and the beeping monitors. The dream sequences were so vivid that I could picture them happening, and it felt like I was watching a movie through words.

29677,422,844,"I really enjoyed this book.  I am actually a little surprised by how much I ended up liking it.  I decided to read this book because I was intrigued by the description.  It was that same description that had me worried that this book may not work for me.  I love the idea of unreliable narrators but I have had mixed luck with them.  Let me just say that this book worked very well for me on all levels.  I read almost the whole book in a single day and could seem to stop turning pages.  I am so glad that I decided to give this book a try.

This is Amber's story.  Amber is in a coma and can hear what is going on around her but can't respond.  I was immediately drawn into the story because I felt like I needed to know how Amber ended up in that coma.  I wouldn't really say that I liked Amber or any of the other characters in the story but I didn't dislike them either.  I had no idea who to trust at any point in the story.

The dual timelines in this book worked well.  Piece by piece, we learn the details of what events led up to her hospitalization as well as everything happening around her while she is in the coma.  I was really equally interesting in both timelines and thought that the story switched from then to now at just the right moments to keep the story moving forward.

This book was full of twists and turns.  It is really best to go into this book as blindly as possible which I was thankfully able to do.  As I read the book I quickly discovered that everything that I thought I knew about the story was completely wrong.  I was taken by surprise many times over the course of the story and sometimes had to take a short break just to process what I had just learned.  I quickly began to expect the unexpected and I still found that I was shocked by some of the twists along the way.

I would recommend this book to others.  I loved how this book kept me guessing until the very end.  I am really impressed with Alice Feeney's style of writing and hope to read more of her work in the future.

29678,615,844,"I'm on a real mystery/thriller kick right now and, I am delighted to say, there are a surprising number of highly anticipated books like this coming out this year. It's only March and this is my fourth such book so far...and I've got a toppling stack more to read. And so far they've all had that delicious ""unreliable narrator' that is so popular right now and I, for one, cannot get enough! Sometimes I Lie is a great example of this suspenseful and page-turning sort of novel, while also turning the genre on its head and making it wholly original and all its own.

 The story is told in three alternating timelines: ""Now"": Amber in a coma in the hospital but not remembering what brought her there; ""Then"": Amber talking about issues at her job and in her personal life, starting about a week before her coma and leading up to what happened; and ""Then"": diary entries from the 1990s that bring interesting insight into the terror and confusion unfolding in the present time. Through much of the beginning of the story the author keeps everything somewhat vague, with Amber talking about being an outsider at work, not having a lot of friends, and being somewhat invisible to everyone, including her family. Being that the synopsis plainly states that Amber lies I tried to take everything I read with a grain of salt while trying to figure out exactly where this story was headed. Being someone who is usually pretty good at figuring twists out I am so happy to state that I was completely thrown by the many (and I mean many!) twists this story took as the myriad of tangled truths and lies finally started to fall into place. At every turn I thought I was on to something and then was completely thrown off course by the truth. And the final pages...I had read in other reviews that they hold a shocking twist and that statement is completely true. I am still trying to wrap my head around it all!

 I can't really say too much more about the plot without giving something away, but I will say that the vast majority of the main characters introduced are hiding things from the reader and that all the various connections, half-truths and straight lies do come out into the light by the last page, which I appreciate as I hate when the dots aren't connected by the end. I will also say that my favorite parts of the story took place within Amber's mind while she was in a coma as these parts were so very creepy for a few different reasons. I have a tendency to get claustrophobic, so reading things about small spaces or someone being trapped tend to make me feel anxious, which makes even more of an impression for this sort of story. The sections of the story where Amber was able to hear and feel things happening around and to her made me so tense, especially when she's let us know some of her secrets but she can't communicate with the other characters to let them know. Add on to this some horrific nightmares she has that involve a little girl with no face who creepy-sings nursery rhymes to her and I was both completely horrified and completely hooked.

Sometimes I Lie is a wonderful example of the current trend in psychological thrillers where you can't trust anyone or even your own interpretation of what you're reading. Every twist has a turn and every character has a lie on their lips.

Even though the unreliable narrator is made clear from the very start, I still had a very difficult time piecing together what was true and what wasnt. Ambers character is extremely compelling and its difficult not to trust her.

The novel is split up by time periods: the coma, the week before the coma, and childhood. The chapters are carefully crafted so that just enough anticipation builds up before the time period changes and the reader is left wondering what happened. This method really works with the story, allowing us to piece together just enough for the plot to move forward while still wanting more.

There were so many twists that I felt were truly surprising, I had a couple of literal jaw-dropping moments while reading.

29688,2571,844,"By now, anyone who reads has seen the blurb. . .
My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:
1. I'm in a coma.
2. My husband doesn't love me anymore.
3. Sometimes I lie.

. . . and the description:
Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can't move. She can't speak. She can't open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn't remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it's the truth?

This is one of those books that is so compelling you want to stop everyone you meet and tell them about it.  But you can't, because this story is so complex and has so many twists and turns that everything you say will be gibberish unless you explain it all - and that would spoil it.

This is the ultimate unreliable narrator, and the Liar's Paradox:  If I say, 'I always tell lies', am I telling the truth?

Amber's life just seems sad.  She's thirty-five years old, married but doesn't think her husband loves her, struggles on the job, appears to have obsessive-compulsive disorder, takes medication.  There's a fairly large cast of characters - husband Paul, Mum & Dad, sister Claire, Nana, friend Jo, friend Taylor and Taylor's parents, co-worker Madeline, ex-boyfriend Edward - and three time periods - Now in the coma, Then just before the accident, and Before through a child's diary entries - and even with all those people and through all that time, she never seems to be quite happy or loved or successful.  She says at one point, ""I am liquid mercury trapped inside a maze.  No matter what I do, I can't seem to flow in the right direction."" and that kind of describes what we know of her whole life.

But what do we really know of Amber's life except what we see through her eyes?  When she says, ""I play the caring wife he needs me to be . . . .  There is no time for me to practice my lines so I'm forced to improvise.  It's not an award-winning performance, but enough to satisfy the audience of one,"" or ""I always get the impression that she (her husband Paul's mother) sees straight through me and doesn't like the view,"" a little of our sympathy for Amber ebbs away.  But then she says, ""Funny how something so small can do so much damage and still look the same,"" and has nightmares about a little girl in a pink dressing gown we are a bit apprehensive for Amber.  And when she says, ""I can convince myself for a few seconds that I'm at the hairdresser's, that life has been restored to my version of normal."" it feels like we have come full circle back to the sometime-liar - MY version of normal.

I read a lot of thrillers and mysteries and like to look for clues, and often solve the mystery before the end of the book.  But I was surprised so many times I think I lost count.  I would think oh, so that's it, and then wow, so that's it, but then it was no, it's THAT?  Over and over, right up until the very end.  Sometimes I Lie is dark, disturbing, relentless and just plain scary.  One of the quotes on the book jacket says you'll be guessing until the very end, and you will.  And you still won't have figured it out and will likely have to go back and re-read that last chapter to be sure you got it right.  Once you pick this book up you won't be able to put it down, and you'll love it.

Thanks to Flatiron Books for giving me an ARC of this compelling and thoroughly enjoyable book.",1520899200,5,anyon read seen blurb name amber reynold three thing know 1 im coma 2 husband doesnt love anymor 3 sometim lie descript amber wake hospit cant move cant speak cant open eye hear everyon around idea amber doesnt rememb happen suspicion husband someth altern paralyz present week accid seri childhood diari twenti year ago brilliant psycholog thriller ask someth realli lie believ truth one book compel want stop everyon meet tell cant stori complex mani twist turn everyth say gibberish unless explain would spoil ultim unreli narrat liar paradox say alway tell lie tell truth amber life seem sad she thirtyf year old marri doesnt think husband love struggl job appear obsessivecompuls disord take medic there fairli larg cast charact husband paul mum dad sister clair nana friend jo friend taylor taylor parent cowork madelin exboyfriend edward three time period coma accid child diari entri even peopl time never seem quit happi love success say one

29693,4378,1917,"Have you ever wondered how people survive in the big woods without a store right around the corner and having wildlife surround you?

The main characters of this story are a little girl named Laura, her sisters Mary and Carrie, and her mother and father. Laura is very happy and always has a positive attitude. Laura's family are pioneers, who live in a can in the big woods. Her family was part of the growing population of pioneers who at the time were beginning to explore and move to the west. Laura and Mary are very responsible because they help Ma with the daily chores. For example, they have to help make the beds or help set the table for dinner.

Their life can be very hard at times because they have to hunt and plant food. Pa goes out hunting at night, while Ma, Laura, and Mary clean up dinner and take a bath.  When Pa gets back from hunting, he plays his fiddle for Laura and Mary, or tells them a story, then they head off to bed. In the spring time, they make maple syrup and have dances at grandma and grandpa's house. They enjoy their life by spending time with their family and friends and by doing fun activities. Although, they enjoy their life they also wish they had a better life. They have to hunt for their own food and protect themselves from the wildlife. The message of the story is to not complain what you have, because others have worse. Don't complain because someone else has better.

My recommendation on this book is positive. I think it was in was interesting to read about how this family survives in the big woods, and still has fun with many fun activities. If you want to read more about how their lives, then read this book!

Tolkien, he created an entire fantasy universe all his own.  He liberally used rich Middle East imagery and terms for his desert planet Arrakis ('Dune').  The book contains royalty, races of superb fighters, sorcery, religions, monsters, space travel, futuristic weapons, and more.  Its message permits on multiple level at the same time (religion, philosophy, ecology, etc.)  It spawned a long series of novels which attracted legions of fans.

Well then let me tell you. In The Diary of the Wimpy Kid, a child named Greg Heffley is under a lot of heat. Greg is a lazy kid who would rather be concealed inside then be out and active. Greg Heffley is middle aged boy who loves games, but when his mother chooses to disconnect the electronics he rebels. But after said events he decides to go to a place called Hardscrabble Farms, a camp that his father went to. The reason he went was because he made a mistake at home and wanted to get away from his dad. While there, he learns the legend of Silas Scratch and the the story unfolds from there.

 The moral of the story  is: Appreciate what you have.  Greg takes the things he has for granted and doesnt appreciate the things his family does for him.  I like this moral since we think we need technology to live, at the same time I don't because technology makes our life 100 times easier. I would 8/10 recommend this book to your child or buy it for yourself. It is a good book for all ages to read.

29739,683,3837,"A BRUSH WITH SHADOWS is as captivating as the Moors in which it occurs.  This sixth book in the Lady Darby Mystery series is fabulous.  Full of austere beauty, a missing cousin, poison, rumors of a curse, and hints of witchcraft, A BRUSH WITH SHADOWS hits all the right notes making it one of my best reads of the year.

Gage and Kiera travel to Dartmoor, where Gage grew up and vowed never to return, after he receives a letter from his grandfather asking him to help in finding his cousin Alfred who has disappeared.  Despite his bad memories, Gage does not hesitate to lend his assistance.  They arrive to find the household little changed.  Gages grandfather is gravely ill, his cousin Rory civil, and Aunt Vanessa as pleasant as ever.  She quickly makes her disapproval of Kiera known, throwing verbal daggers to let Kiera know that she is aware of Kieras scandalous past.  Searching for Alfred fleshes out secrets that no one wants revealed, and each step closer to answers brings danger to Kiera.

I adore the Lady Darby series.  My favorite aspect is the masterful character development that author Anna Lee Huber achieves.  Each of the characters, main and secondary alike, are so detailed and feel like real people.  And the characters shine in A BRUSH WITH SHADOWS.  Intertwined with the mystery, the dialogue and character interaction is the main attraction.  Gage, who is always charming and so sure of himself is quite vulnerable here.  We learn a great deal about the experiences and treatment of a young Sebastian Gage that shape him into the man he is today.  This vulnerability allows for some of the most intimate moments between the newlyweds.  There is still romance within the pages of the book, but the focus is definitely on Gage and Kiera working together to solve the mystery.  The Moors take on a life of their own.  Hubers descriptions are atmospheric and evocative and will stay with you long after the final page is read.

The mystery takes second stage for me behind the characters, but it is still compelling with plenty of twists and second guessing who the bad guy is.  Truthfully, I did not see the responsible partys identity coming until almost the end.  The ending ties everything up a little too neatly, but it all makes sense and is fitting.

A BRUSH WITH SHADOWS is historical mystery storytelling at its best.  Highly recommended.

I must confess that this book was NOT anything like I expected!! Normally, with Sophie Kinsella book's, I expect them to just be funny. This book WAS funny - laugh out loud funny. I had to be careful when I read it in bed or I would wake up my husband!! It also had a twisting and turning plot about marriage which made me realize how lucky I am and so was the main character, Sylvia, to have the husbands that we have.

Alia, the Warbringer, a descendant of Helen of Troy, destined to wreak havoc and devastation to everything that crossed her path. The mortal Alia that Diana needed to remove from the island and must be sent to Greece, to saveThemyscira from destruction.

Together, Alia and Diana must unite and fight, hand in hand, stand side by side, to save both their worlds.

I super enjoyed reading this book. First, it's the story of Wonder Woman, girl power to he max. Nope, I haven't watched the movie itself, but I've read a lot of comics and graphic novels and there's really no reason not to love this heroine. Second, there's Helen of Troy's descendant, Alia. Helen, the face that launched a thousand ships, who apparently, also caused the Trojan War. I've grown up reading about these powerful women, and this book by Leigh Bardugo further intensified my love for them.

And yes, the other characters, Nim and Theo were awesome! They seriously made this whole book hysterically exciting and hilariously fun to read. Diana's innocence (or was it ignorance?) about the modern world and Alia's constant awestruck tendencies made me love them even more.

Leigh Bardugo writes beautifully, I can finally say that. I may have not read her other books, but after reading Wonder Woman, I know I need to get all her other masterpieces. Bardugo is an enigma.

29744,3769,3547,"To be honest, I almost didn't continue reading this book, but after glancing over the posted reviews, I was (thankfully) encouraged to continue... and I was NOT disappointed!!.
I am a VERY prolific reader so sequels are difficult for me to follow... I seem to forget the previous characters and stories before the next installment. I was finding it hard to ""place"" Louisa's cast of characters and frustrated with the entitled New Yorkers (particularly the daughter, Tabitha). However, I quickly discovered that JoJo Moyes did an exceptional job highlighting the backstory without interrupting the flow of the novel. And I adored Louisa's unique way of approaching situations. In fact, I think Louisa in general is an absolute delight... she has moxie and integrity. The supporting characters are equally engaging and well developed in this novel.
I agree with many others that this was as good as (if not better than) the first book.

29747,2162,3823,"I've been crushing on The Others series since Written in Red. While I was patiently waiting for another story about Simon Wolfguard and Meg Corbyn, Anne Bishop decided to introduce Vicki De Vine and a slew of new and interesting Others. I begrudgingly admit that Lake Silence pulled on my heartstrings a bit, and I'm dying for more!

Vicki is the new owner and caretaker of a bed and breakfast, called The Jumble, in a human town controlled by the Others. She doesn't know that there are evil, greedy forces waiting to pounce and take away everything she's worked for. Thankfully, her compassion for the young Aggie Crowe, and other Others she comes across, endear her to the terra indigene leaders and gains her some kind of protection from the Elders.

Yes, I was a little depressed to not get more of Meg and Simon, but Lake Silence has offered a different vibe that makes this story an asset. All the stories up to this point have touches of dark humor, but I found many more laugh out loud moments paired with the violence of life with man-eating creatures. Vicki may struggle with insecurity and anxiety, but her snark and sass come through loud and clear. She finds her voice by the end of the novel and I love her just as much as I love Meg! There are quite a few compelling human characters that also have backgrounds that make them different from the rest of the population. Events in the Lakeside Courtyard are creating a wave of change in the rest of the world and it's characters like Vicki, Officer Grimshaw, and Julian, who do what they can to keep the terra indigene from wiping out the entire population of humans.

I can safely say that I have no idea where this series is going, but I'm behind Anne Bishop 100%! With Lake Silence, she's opened up the world of the Others to our prying eyes and I can't wait to travel a bit further into this fantastical land!

29748,3460,3823,"I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest and voluntary review. I was in no way compensated for this review.

New York Times bestselling author, Anne Bishop returns to the world of The Others with her newest novel, Lake Silence that also starts off the new spinoff series. While our favorite characters are not in this book, they do get mentioned, we are able to meet a whole new cast of characters and I have to say, I liked them a lot! Theyre all so different from the characters weve met before, I think this series will turn out to be just as remarkable as its predecessor!

Vicki DeVine is a newly divorcee who has come into possession of a cabin resort near Lake Silence. She knows she only got it so her lowly ex, Yorick Dane and his new wife got to keep all the cooler toys they owned during their marriage, but Vicki was happy to have a place of her own and a way to continue on living her life with the money that would come in once the resort is up and running. Shes in Other territory, even has a Crow as her first resident, but she adjusts well to her new situation and is even starting to like being a business owner. Then one morning, she notices Aggie Crow trying to heat up an eyeball. Yes, an eyeball. This soon leads to the discovery of a dead body on her property and launches a full investigation into his death, but this is only the start of the chaos that Vicki will have to endure.

It seems that her ex-husband, Yorick, didn't realize a good thing when he had it. Namely that piece of property Vicki now calls him and he will do everything possible to get it back in his possession, not knowing that Vicki has gained herself quite the array of allies in town.

I had initially thought that this one would be a sort of murder mystery given the premise, but thats not the case. I cant say I was overly disappointed, because the story that began to unfold held my attention just as strongly as Annes previous books. As before, we get many points of view from the cast of characters. Even the notorious villains of the story who are only know as Them. It was interesting to get their perspective on things and kind of gave you the heads up for when something scandalous was about to happen.

In a way, Vicki was like Meg in some ways. Not that she was a blood prophet, but her insecurities over herself made her a relatable heroine. Like Meg, she was getting adjusted to a new way of life, though unlike Meg, she was used to the most basic of things and all that kind of jazz. But it felt like she shared an innocence that was similar to Megs.

As before, the pacing to this one wasn't as fast paced as I usually like. It had a more sedate pace, but one that still keeps you highly engaged with the story and wanting to know what happens next. This sort of pace usually wouldnt work for me, but for some reason, Anne does it in a way that keeps me hooked!

Theres not a whole lot of romance in this one either, but if Annes first series of The Others was anything to go by, I have full hope to see something happen eventually. There is already some things going into motion with Vicki and town resident, Julian whos also an Intuit. They are friends as it is, but it seems like theres a potential for more to come. Best thing about Julian? He runs the bookstore in town! Oh yeah!! Lol! And Vicki is a pretty big reader too, so theres more reason to love this heroine!

The ending to this one was packed with action! There was so much going on and I found myself really enjoying this part! Lets just say that the things that were happening with the villains of this story were served justice Other style and I couldn't help but love it. I might be harboring a dark side that enjoys a good dose of vengeance! Lol! Happily I found that there were no cliffhangers in this one! I don't know if Anne plans to stick with these characters for the future books to come or how this new series will play out, but I can say that I am eagerly looking forward to finding out!

You can easily read this book without needing to read the previous series, there are some occurrences that are mentioned in this book that played a role in the first series, but nothing that would lead to confusion and other than mentioning the first set of characters as well, there were no real cameo appearances, though I hope that might change in the future! Lake Silence was a most engaging read that I enjoyed to the fullest!

Living in a funeral parlor, near so many dead bodies and mourners, forever changed how this sweet and unassuming family viewed life and loss. I especially enjoyed Maggie's viewpoint as a 12-13 year old very curious about her new surroundings.

I found this setting especially fascinating since my own grandmother resided in her stepfather's funeral home around the same time period, and I'm guessing she would have been right around Maggie's age.

This story set among the flu epidemic and the tail end of WWI was full of love, loss, perseverance admidst tragedy, and hope, and I would highly recommend it. This was my first book by this author, and I look forward to more!

29757,1216,1173,"Young teenaged girl Venus Black is smart and strong and certain. And she's just seen her family implode. She picked up the gun and pointed it, but she let fate take care of the rest. Unfortunately for her, the bullet found its way into the head of her stepfather, who wasn't supposed to be in gun's trajectory. But he was, and she is immediately arrested. In trying to figure out how to piece her family back together, Venus' mother asks a friend to look after Venus' younger brother, Leo, whose autism makes communication difficult for him. But more devastation befalls the family when Leo goes missing and cannot be found.

More than five years pass as Venus does her time in a juvenile facility. When she finally gets out, she has little more than the clothes on her back, a stolen identity, a heavy burden of bitterness for her mother, and the strong desire to move away from Seattle and start over. She finds a job serving coffee in a diner and a small room to rent where she can save up to buy a car. But the room comes with a caveat--she has to help babysit the homeowner's niece, Piper, a bratty nine-year-old who makes an instant connection to Venus, even when Venus tries to discourage her.

As the weeks pass, Venus works, hangs out with Piper (who starts to grow on her),and tries not to flirt with the cute customer who keeps coming in the diner and sitting at her tables. She stays true to her plan to save for a car so she can move to California. With her new identity, she blends in, keeping her head down and her customers happy. But it's only so long before her past comes calling, and Venus has to face all the anger and bitterness, all the worry about her brother Leo, and all the guilt she feels for what happened to her family.

My Name Is Venus Black is a surprisingly heart-warming story of love, family, starting over, and making peace with your past. Venus is such a smart and amazing kid that you want to stick with her to the end, to find out what really happened that night and what her future holds. Although terrible things happened to this family, the years also brought love, friendship, faith, and healing. Venus and her mother have both found ways to move forward, and reading their story is a beautiful reminder of the capacity of the human spirit.

This debut novel from Heather Lloyd is set in the 1980s, which brings several fun surprises, and the beautiful writing just keeps the pages turning. What could be a maudlin, dark novel is instead a lovely experience of warmth, humanity, and compassion. I strongly recommend this one for adults and teens. It's definitely a keeper.

29758,2543,3508,"""The French Girl"" follows five friends as the body of the French girl they hung out with a decade earlier is discovered, and a French detective travels to England to interview them personally--eventually making it clear that he is confident that one of them is the murderer. The story is narrated by Kate--one of the friends--who is scraping by trying to make a living by founding a legal headhunting firm, as well as thinking of what could have been a decade ago, when she was in a romantic relationship with one of the other friends--Seb--which ultimately ended badly. Besides Kate and Seb, the rest of the friends include Tom (Seb's cousin and a friend of Kate's who's just canceled his long-time engagement to a girlfriend and whose current relationship with Kate is one step away from turning romantic), Lara (Kate's extremely attractive Swedish friend who had a fling with Tom around the time the French girl got killed, and is currently crushing on the French detective leading the investigation), Caro (short for ""Caroline,"" a rich snobby daughter of a lawyer who was a childhood friend of Tom and Seb, and with whom Kate has an up-and-down relationship with), and finally Theo (a sixth friend who's never really a participant of the story because he was killed in Afghanistan a while back--he was a family friend of the French girl and the one who brought her into the group's orbit).

I found the writing easy to read and the lead character to be sympathetic, though the plot stayed slow up until the last quarter of the book. I thought the story could have been better if it jumped back and forth between the time the actual murder of the French girl took place, and the present when the group of friends is being hounded by police rather than focusing exclusively on the present. That would have also allowed to build up two characters--namely the French girl and Theo--as live human beings, rather than purely as Kate's remembrances. There were also a few angles that could have been maximized more (the romantic relationship with the detective, the reason Kate's firm was given her first major contract, etc.) in terms of the reasons why they happened. Ultimately the villain wasn't a surprise (at least for me), but the reveal did make sense and the action in the last quarter of the book rose to the occasion.",1520899200,4,french girl follow five friend bodi french girl hung decad earlier discov french detect travel england interview personallyeventu make clear confid one murder stori narrat kateon friendswho scrape tri make live found legal headhunt firm well think could decad ago romant relationship one friendssebwhich ultim end badli besid kate seb rest friend includ tom seb cousin friend kate who cancel longtim engag girlfriend whose current relationship kate one step away turn romant lara kate extrem attract swedish friend fling tom around time french girl got kill current crush french detect lead investig caro short carolin rich snobbi daughter lawyer childhood friend tom seb kate upanddown relationship final theo sixth friend who never realli particip stori kill afghanistan backh famili friend french girl one brought group orbit found write easi read lead charact sympathet though plot stay slow last quarter book thought stori could better jump back forth time actual murder french girl took place present group friend

29760,2260,3508,"Ten years ago, Kate Channing went with a group of friends to a French farmhouse for a week. Next door, there was a mysterious girl named Severine. Thanks to Severine, their lives were never the same. After their trip, Severine disappeared. Now, all these years later, her body is discovered in a well near the farmhouse.

To this day Kate is haunted by Severine, but she keeps busy trying to keep her legal headhunting firm afloat. When a French investigator shows up on her doorstep in London, shes reminded of that horrible week in France ten years ago. Thinking the whole incident is part of her past, shes taken aback that the investigator wants to bring it all up again. She fears this could hurt her company.

This started off a bit slow for me, but it picked up speed rapidly and I couldn't put it down. Its a riveting, gripping novel filled with secrets, mystery and betrayal. Everything to keep readers on their toes. The author gives many possibilities of where this story can go. Its intriguing to figure out this puzzle along the way. I wanted to know exactly how all these characters fit together and exactly what happened all those years ago.

29767,4857,3560,"This will be an unpopular opinion review. I understand this book has very mixed reviews. Please remember these are my opinions. If you loved this book  great!

I buddy read The Hazel Wood with a lovely group of Bookstagrammers, and I know that some of us enjoyed this book very much. Right off the bat we knew that the reviews were very polarizing, so we had low expectations going into it.

I believe one of the biggest problems with this book is the way it was marketed. In 2017, when The Hazel Wood ARCs were making its rounds through booktube, we were led to believe this would be a high fantasy featuring twisted fairy tales similar to Alice in Wonderland. But once honest reviews began to publish, the major consensus was: The Hazel Wood is not really a fantasy story. It leans toward urban fantasy with mystery/paranormal/contemporary elements.

Knowing all of this before starting, I decided to go in with an open mind. I actually found the first half of the book quite entertaining (except for the main character, Alice, which I will get to in a bit.) There were snippets of creepy fairy tales told by one of the main characters, Finch, and there was a mysterious element featuring a stalker/kidnapper. Since I am a fan of mysteries/thrillers, I was like, Okay, okay, this is kind of fun. Lets see where this goes. I prefer adult mysteries because Ive found most YA mysteries to be generally weak, but I was curious where this story would take me.

Unfortunately, the story quickly derailed once you pass the half way point. Things got downright weird, and I don't mean in a good way. The writing became nonsense, Alice became more unbearable, and I was not impressed with the fantasy aspects. By that point I got bored. I did not get Alice in Wonderland vibes from this book at all (which was another marketing ploy I kept hearing.)

So now its time to get into the good and the bad:

The Good:

- Altheas fairy tales. The stories were downright creepy and I really wanted more. They were reminiscent of the spooky stories found in the graphic novel, Through the Woods by Emily Carroll (highly recommend, btw!) I could read an entire book on just these fairy tales.
- In my opinion, Finch is the only saving grace in this book. Hes smart, he knows his fairy tales, and hes willing to travel to the ends of the Earth to help Alice.

The Bad:

- Alice is not a good person. You will find out she has her reasons, but by that point I just didn't care. She throws tantrums and dismisses Finch (the only black character) when he tries to explain racial profiling. She makes excuses, is hypocritical, and she is dangerous.
- Where were Altheas fairy tales? I think there were two total. They were the most fun parts to read, but sadly they were only a few pages long.
- I wanted more Althea, period. Shes not a fleshed out character (well, none of them are). We don't even get to see much of the Hazel Wood estate either.
- Once you finally get to the fairy tale land, things got extremely boring for me. Albert tried too hard to make that world trippy and nonsensical (like Alice in Wonderland, I guess), but it fell flat to me. By this point I just wanted it all to be over.

I feel misled despite all the warning I received before starting this book. What started as a mysterious/paranormal tale turned into a big disappointment. Also I learned today that there will be two more books in this series? Yikes. Sadly, due to these reasons, I gave The Hazel Wood 2 stars.",1520899200,2,unpopular opinion review understand book mix review plea rememb opinion love book great buddi read hazel wood love group bookstagramm know u enjoy book much right bat knew review polar low expect go believ one biggest problem book way market 2017 hazel wood arc make round booktub led believ would high fantasi featur twist fairi tale similar alic wonderland honest review began publish major consensu hazel wood realli fantasi stori lean toward urban fantasi mysteryparanormalcontemporari element know start decid go open mind actual found first half book quit entertain except main charact alic get bit snippet creepi fairi tale told one main charact finch mysteri element featur stalkerkidnapp sinc fan mysteriesthril like okay okay kind fun let see goe prefer adult mysteri ive found ya mysteri gener weak curiou stori would take unfortun stori quickli derail pas half way point thing got downright weird dont mean good way write becam nonsens alic becam unbear impress fantasi aspect

In 1986 Eddie, met the new English teacher Mr Halloran (aka The Chalk Man) at the fair. Later he gave Eddie the idea of he and his friends leaving messages for each other in chalk. And it was a fun game, that is until the messages lead them to a body in the woods. Fast forward 30 years. Ed and his friends are now grown and the past and the events of that summer are just memories. But then they receive a letter with just a piece of chalk and drawing of a stick figure. Who sent the letters? and is the past coming back to haunt them?

This book alternates between 1986 & 2016. And both time lines are told via Eddie/Ed (12 year old Eddie in 1986 and 42 year old Ed in 2016)

1986: Are the accounts of the summer that lead up to the discovery of the body in the woods by Eddie and his friends, Fat Gav, Metal Mickey, Hoppo, and Nicky (the girl of the group) And I have to say they give me a ""kids from IT kind of feel""

2016: 30 years later, Ed, Hoppo and Fat Gav are still living in their home town. Leading their lives as adults, when they each get a letter with just a piece of chalk and a stick figure on a piece of paper. And this leads Ed to try and figure out what really happened all those years ago.

The writing in this book was great. Like I said I didn't even feel like I was reading a book. It just flowed so well. There was never a moment what I got bored and felt it dragging. And the ending, everything came together so well, and I never figured any of it out. and the Ending, Ending had me go WOW!

From downtrodden, innocent clients (Gardy), to conniving rich and guilty clients (Scanlon), to an innocent older couple wrongly accused of drug trafficking (Renfro) by a SWAT team of warrior cops, Rudd has the connections and street-wise sense of handling such matters. Not all clients are innocent, but Rudd does his best to provide representation and a fair outcome to rough guys such as Tadeo Zapata, a cage fighter who killed his referee in a deadly rage of anger.

As I have said many times before, I typically am not a fan of books that are told from many different viewpoints. However, the way this story was crafted is a masterpiece of glimpses into how interwoven we all truly are and how much our lives affect others even when they only brush against each other in passing.

The world is painted so clearly and painstakingly...it could be us tomorrow, it feels so real. It is an absolutely terrifying thought.

29774,2233,1438,"The premise for this book sounded very exciting, a flight attendant waking up in a hotel room in Dubai next to a viciously murdered man. She is a binge drinker and passes out from over drinking often, she cant remember what happened after she slept with the man. Unfortunately this book took until my Kindle location was at 70% to really get going.

Cassie Bowden is a veteran flight attendant, approaching early middle age, who is unhappy with her life and the way she lives it. All she remembers is that she attended to Alex Sokolov in first class on the flight to Dubai and then ended up in his room and that he was good to her and she liked him. After that she thinks that she had left his room to return to her own, but obviously she didn't because she woke up next to him, right?  She also remembers a woman coming into their room and sharing drinks with them, but there is no sign of anyone entering or leaving their room on the video footage of the hotel room. She is afraid for her life so far from home. She begins to lie, to her flight crew, the FBI which is investigating the case, even to herself.

What I didn't like about this character is that she seemed to be so out of control of her life and that she has been so for many, many years.  Even after this incident, while it is still being actively investigated, she engages with another man whom she has just met. This character did not grow in the least little bit throughout the book. I felt that most of the book was taken up with the investigation but nothing really exciting happened until three quarters of the way through the book.

I wish that Mr. Bohjalian would have made the rest of the book as interesting/exciting as the ending.  Im sure that his fans will probably enjoy this book but I couldn't recommend it.  None of the other characters in the book were well described and there was little said of the cities that she visited and the other people in her life with the exception of her sister. The premise is a good one and perhaps others will find it more fun to read.

Lewis does a very good job of demonstrating how simple evidence based rules of thumb outperform the judgments of experts.  This has important implications for doctors, lawyers, and financial experts who make quite a good living on their subjective advice.  On the other hand, Lewis concedes that there is still a very important place for experts.  The best chapter in the book deals with the Beane-style general manager of the Houston Rockets, who has come to the realization that data and subjective expertise are both quite necessary.

The story of the Israeli psychologists who founded behavioral economics is interesting and well told.

29777,3223,322,"Review of Lewis ""Flash boys"" by Paul F. Ross

 Today, in 2018, a pension fund manager decides to buy 10,000 shares of Microsoft.  She calls her funds stockbroker and places her order.  The pension funds broker, with the order to buy in hand, specifies one of these types of orders 
   good til canceled
   hide not slide
   mid-point peg
   post-only
   market
   limit
 and then indicates the exchange or pool to which the order is first to be sent.  Each order type indicates the way the order is to be handled as it is processed by computers in the stock exchange or pool.  Do you, an investor, understand what your instructions have been to determine the order type?  Few investors know.  The broker enters the order using his computer keyboard, then sends the order to one of these online destinations 
   the New York Stock Exchange
   NASDAQ
   the Goldman Sachs bank which enters the order in their dark pool
   the Royal Bank of Canada
   IEX
 or to one of as many as 35 other possible exchanges, banks, or pools.

  High frequency trading emerged in the 1980s after a new rule was put in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It has been developing since.  High frequency trading allows the high frequency trader (HFT) to discover current offering prices (for those wanting to sell Microsoft shares) on several exchanges, buy Microsoft shares on the exchange where the price is lowest, cause the price of Microsoft stock to rise slightly by having made that purchase, then sell the HFTs newly-purchased Microsoft shares at Microsofts stocks newly established higher price to the broker whose pension manager placed the original order  all in the

elapsed time of a few milliseconds.  The HFT realizes a gain (profit) of decimal parts of a cent for each share the HFT owned for a few milliseconds.  When that decimal part of a penny is multiplied by the order for 10,000 shares it begins to accumulate to real money.  The HFTs success depends on having learned about the stockbrokers order (by probing the market constantly with small orders), discovering the current price in each of multiple exchanges or pools, buying (or selling) shares, and filling the investors buy order before it is filled by another trader.  Success depends on the HFTs computing speed and on signal transmission speed between computers.  HFTs were earning billions of dollars a year by 2010 and those dollars came out of the pockets of investors.  The HFTs earnings amounted to a tax on stock trading.  Stock markets have become much more volatile during the time that the HFTs have been active.  Whether or not this volatility and flash crashes occur because of HFT activity, thus adding to investor risk, is not yet fully known.

 In the 1970s, this reviewer, buying stock, called his stockbroker and named the corporation in which he wished to invest and the number of shares he wished to buy that day.  His orders, the result always returned to him the next day, bought shares at the highest price for the trading day and sold at the lowest price for the trading day.  He wondered if the stockbrokerage were making a few extra dollars beyond those charged for doing the transaction.  Influenced by John Bogles advice to investors, this reviewer changed his investment practice to buying mutual funds indexed to the S&P500 and shopping for investment houses accomplishing very low costs of operation.  Even with the current tax added by HFT activities, todays transaction costs on the computerized markets are a tiny fraction of what they used to be when highly paid market specialists matched buyer and seller orders on the floor of the NYSE (or the American Stock Exchange, or NASDAQ) in the 1970s.

 Michael Lewis book, Flash boys (2015), describes todays stock markets as in the opening paragraph of this review.  It then tells the story of Brad Katsuyama and colleagues.  They became curious about stock market activities (starting while Katsuyama worked with the Royal Bank of Canada), noted that stock markets were not fair to investors, quit high paying jobs, produced the computer code and engineered the computing facilities in New Jersey which gave all stock trades on their exchange an equal and fair chance at the best price as the basic concept for a stock exchange intended, and opened a private dark pool for stock exchange on 25 October 2013.  They won surprisingly high order activity on their first day of operations and have been growing ever since.  Wikipedias article about the IEX exchange (accessed 13 March 2018) reports that the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved IEX as an official stock exchange in June 2016 and that IEX handled two percent of trading volume across all US stock exchanges in 2017.  If there are 35 stock exchanges and pools operating in the US and each is equally attractive, each would handle about three percent of US trading volume.  The second edition of Lewis book (2015) presents an Afterword by Lewis which describes the unsurprising hostile reception of his book by Wall Street when it was published in 2014 and IEXs counter-arguments to the hostility.  The counter-arguments help account for IEXs growing share of all US stock transactions  investors now being able to escape the tax incurred when using the markets (NYSE, NASDAQ, and many others) whose technical computerized arrangements allow HFTs to accomplish high frequency trading.

 Lewis explains in his Acknowledgements that, early in his writing career, he easily won interview time with top leaders on Wall Street when preparing a new book about the stock market.  Having published books (three being The big short, Moneyball, Liars poker) which tell things as they are, Lewis finds he still has access to Wall Street leaders, but they speak with less candor than they used to speak.  When Lewis interviews people in lower positions in the Wall Street brokerages and banks, they speak with candor but ask not to be named.  Flash boys is based on the stock market history of the late twentieth century and the early twenty first century to the date of writing, tells stories about Brad Katsuyama and key personnel in making IEX happen, and reports information from interviews with many in Wall Street firms.  It is very readable and is a must read for anyone with a need to know important details about how the stock markets operate in Wall Street.  However check again soon for things can change quickly in these computerized and regulation-governed markets.

29778,3903,1962,"Book six finds Harry Potter at 16 years of age, a year away from the Wizarding World coming-of-age mark. Spoilers ahead if you haven't read books 1-5. Voldemort is at large, Sirius is dead, a prophecy portends that either Harry or Voldemort must die in order for the other to live, and Harry is left feeling more hollow and alone than ever. Thankfully, he rediscovers just how important friends are to him and how much he means to them, as well. It seems his teenage fits of ""nobody understands me"" is mostly behind him.

Harry is put through a kind of coming-of-age test in this book where he learns a great deal about Tom Riddle's, Voldemort's, past through Dumbledore. The most interesting part of the book, at least for me, is how Harry learns, through memories of the Pensieve, just how sociopathic old Voldy is. The psychology behind the monster is quite interesting and helps Harry to understand, at least he hopes, his enemy.

However, this book is still very much a part of a series that takes place at a school for learning. Hogwarts is still a main focus, and the title of the book itself focuses on an old Potions book Harry finds to assist him in his Auror classes. The book belonged to the pen name ""The Half-Blood Prince;"" it is heavily marked with writing of hints and helpful tips that assist Harry in excelling in Potions, especially since Professor Snape has been switched from Potions to Defense Against the Dark Arts. A sign that Harry insists isn't good. The new Potions teacher is one Professor Slughorn, a portly professor who has a deep affection for students he believes will go far, which, of course, includes Harry.

This is a quite different book from most of the series and, for that, it stands out because, once again, Voldemort as a current wizard takes a bit of a backseat. The war is waging its toll, there are deaths and near-misses, and the Muggle world is beginning to notice that there's something fishy going on.

Author: Holly Black

Age Group: Teen/Young Adult

Genre: Fantasy

Series: Folk of the Air, book one

Star Rating: 5 out of 5 Stars

I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.

Holly Black and I Honestly, we haven't exactly been on the best of terms. I tried reading her debut novel, Tithe, in high school, and the writing style and plot were so weird to me that I ended up giving it to a friend. But when I read one of her more recent fairy books in 2015, The Darkest Part of the Forest, things changed for me. I was absolutely entranced, and when I found out that she was writing a brand new one, this one a trilogy opener, I put it on hold at my local library as soon as possible. I picked it up, and its been sitting on my shelf for a while, beckoning me with its stark white cover, adorned with dark branches and a glittering golden crown. I didn't have any more renewals on it, so I pushed it to the top of the stack, partly out of necessity and partly out of killer anticipation. And this book is probably my favorite of BlacksI cant wait for the sequel!

Judes parents were brutally murdered by her sisters redcap father, Madoc, when she was just seven years old. He spirits her, Vivi, and her twin sister Taryn to the High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, she longs for her own place in her fathers court, where she is respected and accepted by the faeries. Her sister, Taryn, wishes for love and romance at the hands of a handsome faerie noble, but Jude wishes fervently for something different: Her own place in Faerie as a Knight for the Courts High King. But soon she finds herself wrapped up in a dark, vicious web of lies, secrets, and political intrigue, and she must reluctantly make an alliance with the faerie she hates most: Cardan, the Kings youngest son. Forced to use every bit of wit, cleverness, and knowledge shes acquired since coming to Court, Jude must decide if she wants to fight for Faerie, even as she longs for a better life, and even if it means sacrificing everything

This book was, in a word, absolutely fantastic. Its probably my favorite Holly Black book to date, even better than The Darkest Part of the Forest. This book was similar to that, but better! The prose was gorgeous, hypnotic, even during some of the books most violent scenes. I was absolutely spellbound by Judes story, and by Jude herself. I loved how she wasn't the typical main girl character; how she went after what and whom she wanted, and the consequences didn't matter. I loved how she was totally ruthless in her ambition. Her sisters, too, were good foils for her: Taryn with her want of romance and excitement, and Vivi, the only true faerie of the girls, who longs to be free of a life of violence and intrigue and just be with her mortal girlfriend, and fights their father, Madoc, and their way of life. I was totally seduced by the gorgeous, mysterious Faerieland, where lies and promises are hidden inside honeyed words, one bite of sweet, golden fruit can send you spiraling into madness, and hiding skeletons in your closet can mean certain ruineven death. I loved all of the characters, but especially Madoc, Locke, and Cardan. Especially Cardan. One of the things I loved most about this book was the constant romantic tensionI was dying. And that ending! Oh my gosh, Holly, how in the world am I supposed to wait until 2019 for The Wicked King?! How could you do this to me?! The Cruel Prince is one of my favorite books of 2018; the only problem is that I have to wait for the sequel! The bottom line: A darkly glittering fairy tale more Grimm than Disney, The Cruel Prince is one of the best books of 2018, and I cant wait for the sequel! Talk about a major book hangover!

29806,4471,1438,"Have you ever known (or known of) someone whose life has begun to resemble a raging dumpster fire due to their epically poor decision-making or coping skills? Well, multiply that times ten and you might be close to the disaster that is Cassandra Bowden, main character of author Chris Bohjalian's latest release The Flight Attendant.

""Like almost everything else she did, it was crossing a line that most people wouldnt. She did it because it thrilled her. It was just that simple. She did it because it was, like so much else that made her happy, dangerous and self-destructive and just a little bit sick.""

Most of Cassandra's poor decisions are in direct correlation to her relationship with alcohol; drinking is the tool that she has chosen to employ in an effort to cover up old wounds that tend to resurface regularly. It's unfortunate, and she fully acknowledges her need to clean up, but she struggles with self-worth and an unrequited desire for genuine happiness.

""She learned quickly that music sounded better, people were nicer, and she was prettier when lifes rough edges had been smoothed over with a little alcohol.""

Unfortunately, one of her adventures leads her into the bed of an international traveler who, as it turns out, may be hiding some secrets of his own; when she wakes up the morning after, he is dead...still in bed, next to her. GAH!

""This, she thought with a terrible certainty, might really be the moment she would look back upon as the point where it all began to unravel.""

As usual, Bohjalian weaves a crafty tale, full of details and careful plot development; he introduces another character, one who has been tasked with tying up the loose ends of that evening, and Cassandra is forced to admit that she may be in more trouble than she can handle.

""It was while crossing Fifth Avenue near the library that she felt it: a prickle of unease along her skin. A shiver along the back of her neck. She knew the word from a psychology course shed taken in college: scopaesthesia. The idea was you could sense when you were being watched.""

While this is not my favorite of his novels, and I found myself a little distracted during some of the narrative about Russian ties and international money-laundering networks (although super timely!), overall this was an entertaining read. Often cringe-worthy, as Cassandra digs herself deeper and deeper into an isolating existence, Bohjalian remains one of the best at crafting flawed, broken characters who manage to survive unimaginable circumstances.",1520899200,4,ever known known someon whose life begun resembl rage dumpster fire due epic poor decisionmak cope skill well multipli time ten might close disast cassandra bowden main charact author chri bohjalian latest releas flight attend like almost everyth el cross line peopl wouldnt thrill simpl like much el made happi danger selfdestruct littl bit sick cassandra poor decis direct correl relationship alcohol drink tool chosen employ effort cover old wound tend resurfac regularli unfortun fulli acknowledg need clean struggl selfworth unrequit desir genuin happi learn quickli music sound better peopl nicer prettier life rough edg smooth littl alcohol unfortun one adventur lead bed intern travel turn may hide secret wake morn deadstil bed next gah thought terribl certainti might realli moment would look back upon point began unravel usual bohjalian weav crafti tale full detail care plot develop introduc anoth charact one task tie loo end even cassandra forc admit
29807,2014,1438,"I had requested this book from Doubleday because I was in the mood for a good mystery/thriller. I was taken in by the blurb. So when I was approved for the book, I was pretty excited. Then I read the book. Talk about a letdown. I came close to DNFing several times because the story couldn't keep my attention. But when I start a book, I read it through to the end, no matter how bad it was.

The Flight Attendant started off with Cassie, waking up in a strange hotel room in Dubai with a hangover. That hangover turns to horror when she realizes that she is in bed with a corpse. The man she had slept with the night before had been killed, his throat slashed and he bled out all over the bed. Cassie panics and leaves. Her leaving starts an avalanche of lies that catch up with her.

I was so annoyed with Cassie during the book. It seemed like her mentality was that of a horny college student who cant hold their alcohol. Her exploits before Dubai and mostly afterward always included alcohol. There was a point where I sighed and said to myself Why doesnt anyone say something to her or suggest she goes to rehab to dry out? I mean, even her own sister didn't trust her alone with her niece and nephew because of the drinking.

She also didn't listen to anyone. She had a lawyer that was supplied by the flight attendant union. That lawyer told her to plead the 5th. But did she listen? For a little while. Then she told some of the truth and more lies. I was yelling at the book in my head and said Lady, are you effing kidding me? Shut up!! Listen to your lawyer!! I almost put the book down after that. Like I said, she annoyed the ever-living out of me.

I did like the parallel storyline of the assassin. I thought it was very interesting how she came to be one. I also thought her not killing Cassie when she had the chance was very telling. I did think that she was going to let Cassie go.

The end of the book was a big mind screw. Everything was turned upside down and that is what saved this book from getting a 1-star rating. I was not expecting the twists that appeared out of nowhere. So wasn't expecting any of that and I loved it!! I thought the epilogue was a little much but I was happy for Cassie. I guess.

The Flight Attendant was a very slow-moving book up until Cassie goes to Italy for the 2nd time. Then it picks up the pace. I couldn't get into this book. Besides it being slow, the characters came across as flat. I couldn't connect with any of them. The ending was fantastic and it saved the book for me. The twists that the author did shock me and they made the book.

29808,4462,1438,"The Flight Attendant tells the story of Cassandra (Cassie) Bowden; a flight attendant with a penchant for heavy drinking and bad decisions. The story opens with Cassie waking up in a hotel room in Dubai.

29810,950,1438,"Cassandra Bowen is a flight attendant with a history of bad decisions--most of them tied to her predilection to heavy drinking. Mostly her drinking leads to sexual encounters with dubious men, topless dancing, and a few bouts of blackouts. But when Cassie's work takes her to Dubai, she spends the night with a gentleman she met on the plane, drinking heavily with him all evening; in the morning she wakes up next to him in bed and finds him dead, covered in blood. Alone and female in Dubai, Cassie sneaks out of the hotel room and returns home on the plane with her fellow flight attendants, setting off a trail of lies that will haunt her. And in the back of her mind, she fears the worst: could she have killed Alex while drunk? And what will happen when the authorities discover her deception?

This novel starts off with a bang, with Cassie waking up next to a dead man. Once Cassie gets back to the States, I found myself fascinated what could possibly happen for the other 80% of the book. (My mistake, a lot can happen.) The entire novel kept me wondering what on earth would come next. This is a crazy, unpredictable book that sucks you in and never lets you go. I was constantly wondering who the various characters were--who really was Alex, for instance? Is there more to Cassie than we are being told? I was honestly confused for a good portion of the book, which doesn't happen often when I read.

It was really fun and befuddling to piece things together in this one. The book was rather stressful, trying to decipher all the various characters and to deal with Cassie's high-risk behavior. As the end nears, I was actually shocked by a couple of twists, which I really appreciated. It's rare that a thriller truly shocks me anymore. I was truly impressed with this one. The ending was a little odd, but as I pondered it more, I think I'm good with it.

As for Cassie, she was a hard character to like, and there's certainly been no shortage of unreliable drunken female narrators in contemporary fiction as of late. Still, you can't help but get caught up in her story. It's compulsively readable. There are also lots of good flight attendant stories; Chris Bohjalian always well researches his books.

Cassie's chapters also alternate with a woman named Elena, which is an effective storytelling device, and only ratchets up the suspense. Her tale is just as befuddling as Cassie's--perhaps even more so--and just added to my desire to turn the pages and find out what on earth was going on and how these people were all connected. Bohjalian really weaved a fascinating story here, and I love how all of his books are so different. Whereas some can be emotional, this one was truly a thriller, and focused so much on the story and mystery. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but it was great.

I also found some amusing little personal tidbits in the book: references to Charlottesville (the second in a row in the novels I read--it's my hometown) and Cassie's Kentucky references, including her attendance at the University of Kentucky. We are, in fact, a UK and UVA household--my five-year-old twins are very divided between the two. It's funny how little things stick with you when you read a novel.

Overall, this was a great read. Completely befuddling, but incredibly suspenseful and just sort of fun. Not at all what I expected from Bohjalian, but a fascinating, enjoyable thriller. I was completely lost in Cassie and Elena's bizarre world for a few days--the sign of a great book. 4 stars.

29812,630,1438,"Cassandra Bowden is no stranger to hungover mornings. Shes a binge drinker, her job with the airline making it easy to find adventure, and the occasional blackouts seem to be inevitable. She lives with them, and the accompanying self-loathing. When she awakes in a Dubai hotel room, she tries to piece the previous night back together, counting the minutes until she has to catch her crew shuttle to the airport. She quietly slides out of bed, careful not to aggravate her already pounding head, and looks at the man she spent the night with. She sees his dark hair. His utter stillness. And blood, a slick, still wet pool on the crisp white sheets. Afraid to call the police  shes a single woman alone in a hotel room far from home  Cassie begins to lie. She lies as she joins the other flight attendants and pilots in the van. She lies on the way to Paris as she works the first class cabin. She lies to the FBI agents in New York who meet her at the gate. Soon its too late to come clean-or face the truth about what really happened back in Dubai. Could she have killed him? If not, who did?

  Set amid the captivating world of those whose lives unfold at forty thousand feet, The Flight Attendant unveils a spellbinding story of memory, of the giddy pleasures of alcohol and the devastating consequences of addiction, and of murder far from home.

My Thoughts: Cassie was a character I could empathize with, despite her flawed character, since anyone who has ever had too much to drink could picture themselves doing some of what Cassie did after the horror of her blackout evening. She doesnt believe that she could have killed Alexthere have been no incidents of prior blackouts in which she had done anything even slightly violent.

But would anyone believe her? The fear of being held captive in Dubai kept her moving forward to get to her flight and return to the U.S. The intensity of those moments, the near misses, struggling to find a way to hide her presence in the hotelthese were the series of events that she had to get through before she was safe, and which kept me rapidly turning pages.

Even back at home, with the FBI interrogations and eventually with an attorney she hires, she is just putting one foot in front of the other and hoping to somehow get through it all.

An alternate narrative brings the character of Elena, a Russian woman somehow connected to the events of that night. Her thoughts, her plansall add an element of mystery and suspense. An undercurrent of political intrigue and executions. As we follow Elenas movements, we realize that she is not who she says she is.

When one considers all the grim possibilities, we realize that just getting back home will not necessarily protect Cassie, and I couldn't stop reading, eager to find out what would ultimately happen. Unexpected twists and turns made for a hopeful denouement.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Flight-Attendant-A-Novel/dp/B072STPX8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Flight Attendant: A Novel</a>&nbsp;reminded me that, while bad choices can change our lives forever, one can also change ones own destiny. 5 stars.",1520899200,5,cassandra bowden stranger hungov morn she bing drinker job airlin make easi find adventur occasion blackout seem inevit live accompani selfloath awak dubai hotel room tri piec previou night back togeth count minut catch crew shuttl airport quietli slide bed care aggrav alreadi pound head look man spent night see dark hair utter still blood slick still wet pool crisp white sheet afraid call polic she singl woman alon hotel room far home cassi begin lie lie join flight attend pilot van lie way pari work first class cabin lie fbi agent new york meet gate soon late come cleanor face truth realli happen back dubai could kill set amid captiv world whose live unfold forti thousand foot flight attend unveil spellbind stori memori giddi pleasur alcohol devast consequ addict murder far home thought cassi charact could empath despit flaw charact sinc anyon ever much drink could pictur cassi horror blackout even doesnt believ could kill alexther incid prior

29814,2005,1438,"Cassie Bowden is a bit of a mess.  Like her father, she drinks too much.  She drinks so much, she actually blacks out and doesnt remember much of the night before on those mornings when she wakes up with a hangover.  But one morning is a bit different.  She wakes up next to a man who has had his throat slit.  Should she call the police or will she be blamed?  Should she be blamed?  Did the guy attack her the night before and she fought back, killing him?  How could she have slept through his murder?  Was she just in the wrong place at the wrong time?

Chris Bohjalian books have always grabbed my attention.  He writes from the heart and his books always touch me in some way.  I cant say that this one did.  Cassie is not a likeable character and I never felt any empathy for her.  Yes, there were suspenseful moments and yes, she got herself in some predicaments throughout the book.  But I really didn't care much about what happened to her.  I cared more for Enrico at one point in the book and he was a very minor character.  I thought the ending was well done.

I think if anyone else had written the book, I would have liked it more.  I expected more connection with the characters in a book written by this author than I encountered here.  I didn't even read what the book was about before requesting it as I knew I wanted to read anything that Chris Bohjalian writes.  This is more of a thriller/spy/espionage type of book than his usual.

29816,2382,1438,"YES YES YES!! Last page turned. Heart beating fast. Mic drop. Cue the slow clap. This is a phenomenal character-driven mystery WITH A TWISTY, SATISFYING ENDING I will not soon forget.

I don't know who said the devil is in the details but if thats true, then Chris Bohjalian is the devil himself. This plot is intricate and complex with well-researched details and data providing clues for the reader in this story of international suspense.

Yes, much of the story is set in cushy locales and sumptuous hotels, but the pull of the novel lies in our high-flying party girl. Our flight attendant, Cassie, is a psychologically damaged woman who single-handedly drinks more in an evening than I do in a year. She means well, loves her friends and family and volunteers at the animal shelter whenever she is at home in NYC. Awww, a detail that deff pulled at my heartstrings. Cassie, with all her flaws, is a human being as real as any fictional character can possibly become. She is endearing, maddening, and most of all, REAL! I loved her.

I don't want to give away any of the story line, because it goes in places you will not expect. And you will love that. What I can say is... this is the book I wanted The Woman in Cabin 10 to be. It is a very strong and convincing plot with thoroughly fleshed out characters. Ruth Ware is a swell writer, but (forgive me for saying!) she could stand to learn a thing or two from Bohjalian when it comes to structure and plot.

You think youve heard all the gossipy stories about the crazy things passengers do on planes? Wait until you read some of the nuggets Cassie has to share about things she has seen in her career! I also loved reading about the flight schedules, the day-to-day life, THE DETAILS of what it's like to be a flight attendant. I found it riveting!!

An old-fashioned suspense thriller that reads as fast as an addictive domestic noir, it is simply terrific. All my respect to the brilliant Mr. Bohjalian! You will not want to miss this one.

29818,1658,1438,"Sister. Orphan. Flight Attendant.

Lonely. Drunk. Easy.

Cassandra Bowden is all of these things. Complex and simple; she is a contradiction.

Being a drunk helps her forget. The numbness that comes with alcohol is the real craving. As vodka, gin, or tequila trickle down her throat and spreads into her stomach, they help to create a warm trail of deception. She becomes outgoing  in overtly embarrassing ways. She loses her insecurities  and shares her body with nearly anyone. She becomes smarter  if only to herself. Alcohol allows her to become whomever she wants to be, even if she cant remember.

The black-outs are normal, for Cassie. She has become accustomed to waking up in any number of countries around the world, wrapped around a beautiful stranger, the smell of their sex lingering in the air of the hotel room amongst empty mini-bar bottles and lacy undergarments. Paris. Rome. Frankfurt. All of these landmark cities hold secrets of her life, snapshots of bad decisions and a myriad of mistakes. Being a flight attendant has a multitude of advantages: she can slip into the skin of anyone she so desires, slip between the sheets with whomever will take her, and forget the long nights spent in the company of booze and boys by hopping the next flight out in the morning. She leaves behind her transgressions in a cloud of jet fuel and roasted snack-sized peanuts.

One particular random hook-up will change things for Cassie, and not necessarily for the better. Meeting the handsome and enthusiastic Alex on her flight was a happy coincidence. Their flirty chatter helped to alleviate the persistent hangover Cassie was enduring, and passed the time on the long flight from New York to Dubai in a pleasant fashion. He was charming when he invited her to dinner, the two of them discussing Tolstoy and Russian literature over a duo of expensive meals, all the more lubricated by the constant flow of high-end liquor. Alex was attentive and gentle as he washed her hair in the shower of his extravagant hotel suite. He was full of finesse and vigor as he made love to her repeatedly over the course of their evening together; their time in one anothers company only interrupted once  when a vague colleague named Miranda joined them for a drink.

In the deep and foggy recesses of her mind, Cassie knows she put her clothes back on at some point and departed Alexs suite, hoping to make it back to her own hotel room and the group of flight attendants she was working with before anyone noticed. She tried not to make it a habit of sleeping over, preferring to wake up in her own room so she had plenty of time to get ready before jetting back to New York. She also liked to try and avoid the subsequent judgements from her co-workers when they realized shed hooked up with yet another man. But sometimes the alcohol voids all sense of reason; the black-out drunkenness forbids her from truly committing herself to anything but whatever happens to be in that precise moment.

When Cassie wakes up, she can sense she is not alone. Flickers of light seep into the room from the suites impressive bank of windows, the Dubai sun bringing with it a temperature that she knows will be next to unbearable. She must get up. She must get out. She must back her way back to her own hotel. Despite the incessant pounding in her head.

Slowly turning over to face Alex so she can beg off politely, Cassie is faced with the unexpected.

Hes dead. And not just dead, but brutally murdered. His throat has been slashed, his head all but severed from the rest of his young and muscular body. There is blood everywhere, soaking into the mattress and slicking her hair and coating her own body. It almost doesnt appear to be real  how could one body hold such a gargantuan amount of blood inside of it? Frantically searching her brain for any shred of information that will explain what happened the evening before that could have led to this outcome, Cassie finds nothing but a black void.

Thinking quickly, she showers any trace of Alexs lifeblood from her body and tries to wipe down everything she has touched. She carefully gathers the pieces and shards of a broken bottle that may or may not have been used in his murder, planning to drop it in a random trash can later. She gazes upon his dead body with mixed feelings and a wave of regret. Alex had been kind. Gentle. If even for the one night. Other thoughts cross her mind. Did she do this? Did someone else? What should she do now?

Terrified at the prospect of the consequences of murder in a foreign country known for its swift and unforgiving hammer of justice, Cassie flees the scene and calls upon every ounce of resolve she can muster to relieve herself of the murder weapon and join her flight crew appearing calm and collected. Hiding this is the only way to abscond herself from prosecution and the prospect of being jailed in a foreign country indefinitely. But there are some things you cannot escape, even transcontinentally.

It doesnt take long for the murder to be discovered, or for the FBI to come knocking on Cassies door. Scraping up courage and nudged in the direction of an excellent lawyer by an unexpected ally, the flight attendant begins to cover her tracks. But the ever-reaching grasp of alcohol continues to pull on her, wrapping itself around her body and better judgement like overgrown vines scaling an abandoned garden. She self-sabotages; she cannot stop herself from pathologically lying to everyone. Cassie finds herself becoming obsessed with the man she spent one night with  was Alex a Russian spy? A thief? A murderer himself? Why would someone kill him  execute him  in such a fashion? Is she sure it wasn't her?

The Flight Attendant is the newest novel from Chris Bohjalian, a New York Times bestselling author known for his mastery of the suspense novel and his thrilling plot lines. But while the opening of this novel was interesting and gripping, I found myself feeling less satisfied as the book progressed. The character of Cassie was one who was very difficult to like, and I found myself wondering at times if the author even liked her himself. She was promiscuous to almost a comical degree, she was self-loathing and spent much of her time in a depressive state, and there was literally nothing redeeming about her whatsoever. As the plot moved ahead, I found myself disliking Cassie more and more, and wondering if the author meant for her to come off quite as stupid as she appeared to be. Her choices were non-sensical, even for a drunk, and not realistic in my opinion. There was a disconnect. In fact, nearly every character seemed out of place and overly manufactured.

As a result, I have to give this book no more than 3 stars. I was disappointed. I was very excited to read a novel by this particular author, as so many of his books have come up in my time as a reviewer, with praise and high recommendations. I don't know if the plot was just off for me, or if it was something else. The rating on Goodreads is rather high, and I just did not find that it was worthy. The ending was roughly sewn together with next to no closure, and I did not understand the point of the epilogue  nor did it make any sense to me. Given the shameful portrait Bohjalian drew of Cassie, it was unlikely she would have ended up where she indeed ended up.

The writing was well done, as a whole, and I won't allow one mediocre book to keep me from reading another of Bohjalians works. Midwives has been on my TBR list for a while, and Im hoping its better than this novel.

All in all, the most I can say is that I recommend the first quarter of this book.

I was completely caught up in Cassies dilemma. I read this in two days. It is a mesmerizing page turner. This is what I call a smart read. You cannot skip anything or you miss something important. It is an intricate and complex storyTHEN THE ENDING! Did not see that coming!

Just imagine waking up one morning in bed with a man you barely know, who just happens to have his throat slashed!  This is what happened to Cassandra Bowden, a flight attendant with a dangerous habit of drinking combined with promiscuity.

The story moves back and forth from Cassandra to the murderer, who is thought to be a woman named Miranda.  Miranda is a bit of a mystery and I enjoyed seeing her story come to light as the investigation into the murder got underway.

The ending had a few surprises.  Some may have been a bit too coincidental, but I loved it anyway.  This thriller had sex (though not explicit), money, murder, Russian intrigue and family drama all rolled into one compelling story.  I really enjoyed it!

29827,834,1438,"fullsizeoutput_2765MY REVIEW OF THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT BY CHRIS BOHJALIAN

I was captivated by The Flight Attendant By Chris Bohjalian. The genres for this novel are Mystery and Fiction. The author describes his characters as complex and complicated. There is suspense, twists and turns, and drama. After all, Chris Bohjalian is quite adept at describing vivid details and storytelling.

Have you ever wondered what the life of a flight attendant might be like? You might think there is adventure, and opportunity for travel. Could you in your wildest dreams imagine danger and murder?  Cassandra Bowden has been a flight attendant for years, and has seen and done many things. Cassandra Bowden is also  a binge drinker that is subject to blackouts, where she cant recall often what happens.

From NetGalley, here is a significant blurb, A powerful story about the ways an entire life can change in one night. A flight attendant wakes up in the wrong hotel, in the wrong bed, with a dead man, and no idea what happened.  Is it possible that Cassandra has killed a man, a passenger that she met on her flight? Next thing Cassandra knows is the FBI is involved, the Press is involves, and she if forced to take a really hard look at her shortcomings, and come to grips with her problems.

I appreciate that Chris Bohjalian discusses addiction and alcoholism, and the devastating consequences. In would recommend this intense, intriguing mystery for readers that enjoy this genre.

29828,984,1438,"""I'm a very, very good liar. I lie all the time. I lie to other people. I lie to myself.""

Chris Bohjalian's new book is an intricately plotted suspense novel. It's told from dual points of view by two well written female characters. Cassie is a Flight Attendant who drinks until she blacks out and often wakes up in the bed of someone she doesn't know. Elena is an assassin who works for a covert group in Russia. Most of the story is Cassie's and what a story it is. She is a total mess but so well written that the reader is immediately drawn into her story to see where she will lead them. She is often confused, doesn't listen to other people's advice and continues to follow behavior that has gotten her into trouble in the past -- in other words a complex and interesting character to get to know.

As the novel begins, Cassie wakes up in a strange room in Dubai. At first she wasn't sure where she was or how she had gotten there. She remembers flirting with an American hedge fund manager - on the flight and agreeing to have dinner with him. After a lot of alcohol, she went to his room at the hotel but due to the amount of alcohol consumed, things got a bit fuzzy after that. When she rolls over in bed and finds blood all over, she sees that he is dead. She doesn't think that she killed him but maybe, just maybe, she did. She puts the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door, takes a shower and goes back to her hotel where she soon boards a flight back to the US and nervously awaits whatever is going to happen next but she continues to lie - to the other flight attendants on her flight, to the FBI who are waiting at the gate and most importantly to herself.

This is a wonderful page turner of a novel. Even though Cassie would be an easy character to dislike as she continues to make the same mistakes over and over, she is written in such a way that I found her to be very sympathetic and I was rooting for a good outcome for her. In my opinion, Chris Bohjalian writes female characters better than any male author and his two main female characters are entirely believable - flaws included. This is another fantastic novel by this talented author.

29830,1405,1438,"A portrait of a woman at the very bottom of a self loathing feeling about herself. Cassandra Bowden is a flight attendant with about 20 years working in the profession.  She has reached the point that she can bid on and work flights to most exotic destinations in the world.  Unfortunately she has found the life of always being in different cities completely unsatisfying and empty.  She has become a binge drinker often arriving at her destination, getting drunk and picking up a strange man to have sex with little memory of what has happened.  The novel begins with Cassy arriving in Dubai.  She wakes up in a hotel room that is not the room nor the hotel that the rest of her flight crew are staying at  And as many times before she gets up with a pounding headache and just attempts to find out if she can still make a shuttle at the crew's hotel to take her to the airport for her assignment on the plane back to the states.
  This time there is a vast difference from other times.  The man laying next to her has a wide gash in his neck.  His blood is all over the bed and he is quite dead obviously a murder victim.  Cassie begins a series of lies to her fellow flight crew members, to her sister and her family back in the states, and to the FBI waiting for her at the gate in New York. Her thinking is that she will be accused of  murder and doesn't know how to hide her being in the same room with a murdered man.
  As with his other novels Mr Bohjalian has researched the variables of careers spent going from one exotic place to another at 35,000 feet and always being away from home.  Cassie has been in most of the  world, has no family ties except for a younger sister  her husband and children who she rarely sees, and no friends outside of the acquaintances among her fellow crew members.  Her life is spent drinking and moving from one one night stand to another with no permanent ties to speak of.
  The book moves from the murder to one complication after another for Cassie.  Her thoughts and feelings are well described by the author as are those of other key individuals taking part in the story.  It is a novel that brings the reader unerringly into its permutations and combinations.  A fascinating adventure into what is an environment far beyond the normal one of people whose jobs are within commuting distances from their homes and families and spend evenings with their loved ones.",1520899200,4,portrait woman bottom self loath feel cassandra bowden flight attend 20 year work profess reach point bid work flight exot destin world unfortun found life alway differ citi complet unsatisfi empti becom bing drinker often arriv destin get drunk pick strang man sex littl memori happen novel begin cassi arriv dubai wake hotel room room hotel rest flight crew stay mani time get pound headach attempt find still make shuttl crew hotel take airport assign plane back state time vast differ time man lay next wide gash neck blood bed quit dead obvious murder victim cassi begin seri lie fellow flight crew member sister famili back state fbi wait gate new york think accus murder doesnt know hide room murder man novel mr bohjalian research variabl career spent go one exot place anoth 35000 foot alway

29843,4144,789,"As far as I'm concerned, you can't beat a good whodunnit: the twists and turns, the clues and the red herrings and then, finally, the satisfaction of having everything explained to you in a way that makes you kick yourself because you hadn't seen it from the start.

Horowitz supports his own contention by providing two mysteries in one. And along the way it seems as though hes having a laugh. We get to read the final manuscript from a well known mystery writer who intends to end his fictional detective and to examine the death of the writer himself.

This gives the author room to skewer writing and writers, publishing, and creative plagiarism. He provides plenty of entertaining bon mots, Our lives continue along the straight lines that have been set out for us. Fiction merely allows us a glimpse of the alternative. Maybe thats one of the reasons we enjoy it.

Within the pages he marvels at our appetite for crime. Saying at one point, the BBC would have little to show if not for crime programming, Inspector Morse, Taggart, Lewis, Foyles War, Endeavour, A Touch of Frost, Luther, The Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Cracker, Broadchurch and even bloody Maigret and Wallander  British TV would disappear into a dot on the screen without murder.

Here he gets to it more, It's strange when you think about it. There are hundreds and hundreds of murders in books and television. It would be hard for narrative fiction to survive without them. And yet there are almost none in real life, unless you happen to live in the wrong area. Why is it that we have such a need for murder mystery? And what is it that attracts us? The crime, or the solution? Do we have some primal need of bloodshed because our own lives are so safe, so comfortable?

The chief investigator in both mysteries is the editor. That is what makes it inventive. It gives us the inside track but does little to help us solve either. Horowitz keeps us guessing till the end(s). That is why he is having a laugh but he invites us to join him in the humour.",1520899200,4,far im concern cant beat good whodunnit twist turn clue red her final satisfact everyth explain way make kick hadnt seen start horowitz support content provid two mysteri one along way seem though he laugh get read final manuscript well known mysteri writer intend end fiction detect examin death writer give author room skewer write writer publish creativ plagiar provid plenti entertain bon mot live continu along straight line set u fiction mere allow u glimps altern mayb that one reason enjoy within page marvel appetit crime say one point bbc would littl show crime program inspector mors taggart lewi foyl war endeavour touch frost luther inspector lynley mysteri cracker broadchurch even bloodi maigret walland british tv would disappear dot screen without murder get strang think hundr hundr murder book televis would hard narr fiction surviv without yet almost none real life unless happen live wrong area need murder mysteri attract u crime solut primal need bloodsh

29852,1607,3403,"While some Yong Adult books cross over quite well into the adult market, this is one that I must admit, after even a hundred pages, just felt a little too YA for me The diversity of the cast of characters, while appealing from that standpoint, makes these characters feel like they are there more to check boxes than be authentic characters and people on their own. They seem to exist in the book just to ensure that there is a United Colors of Benneton feel to the book, and its unnamed location also doesnt work for this Anytown, Anyschool, US location.

The hook, as the title suggests, involves bombs planted all over the hallways of Hallwood High School. Once those bombs begin going off (before school has officially started, but with extracurriculars still causing the halls to fill up), the book does get more interesting, but its hard to really connect with any of these teens.

29853,4007,3403,"When I first saw the description of Time Bomb by Joelle Charbonneau I couldn't help but be extremely curious. Last year I had heard all the buzz for This Is Where It Ends and had high hopes when I picked that one up only to be really disappointed. However, after reading Time Bomb I have to say that this one was what I was looking for last year.

For me as a reader I had thought This is Where It Ends completely lacked character development and I simply was never drawn into the students stories or brought to any kind of level of caring as they went through such a horrific event. I also thought that the author had taken the opportunity to write about a school with diversity in her characters and turned it into something that felt awkward at any mention of the diversity.

Time Bomb made such an improvement on those major areas that had bothered me in This Is Where It Ends and actually brought a horrific and very much a realistic event to life. The entire book takes place over a couple of hours during a time a few students were in their school when bombs began to explode. It changes the point of view between six main characters that are each still alive and struggling with how to get out of the school.

The book has a very intense vibe to it as the story unfolds but in the back of my mind I also made the comparison to the Breakfast Club with the group that formed. We had the football star, the princess who is a Senators daughter and Ms. Perfect of the school, the tattooed bad boy, the overweight and bullied outsider, but then stretching the cast of characters even more and bringing the story into this decade was the boy who had not only just come out to his family as gay but was also a mixed race, and then we had a Muslim student who struggled daily with the prejudices against him.

As the story began and with each chapter changing the point of view it was easy to see that the entire group all had their own secrets and struggles. It became clear that all would have a motive for being behind the bombing so it leads the readers to the question of which one really did it? With a short cast of suspects Im sure many may guess but regardless this was one that made me feel Id stepped into this horrible scenario and was on the edge of my seat waiting for the outcome.

29854,1371,3403,"More than anything, this book challenges the reader to avoid stereotypes and assumptions about the situations of others.  It's timely, thought-provoking, and will stay with you long after finishing.

At first glance, this group of high school teens appear to be a Breakfast Club assortment.  Or are they?  As the story progresses, it's revealed each is dealing with their own issues to include racism, homosexuality, religious discrimination, bullying, and suicide.  The interactions between Rashid and Tad are especially compelling.  With the exception of Frankie and Kaitlyn, the character development is incredible - the teens are real, relatable, and flawed.  For me, Frankie comes across as a little too stereotypical, and very little information about Kaitlyn is given.

All have motivations for planting the bombs, and determining the identity of the bomber may force the reader to face their own stereotypes and prejudices.  You may surprise yourself.  These teens experience a horrific situation, and I appreciated that the author didn't create a tidy ending solving all their problems.

A quick, action-packed, and stimulating read, Time Bomb is so much more than teenagers fighting for their lives.  This is easily a cross-over and something I'd highly recommend for book clubs.

29861,1607,3468,"This novel, written in the style of a long piece of investigative journalism, tells the story of just what the title suggests  a miraculous recovery of a soldier who had been paralyzed in Afghanistan. This war veteran, Cameron Harris, sits outside of his Biloxi, Mississippi convenience store, four years after his injury, and stands and walks, feeling suddenly restored to his lower limbs. It is an interesting novel, but its style makes it a bit dense than its short summary would otherwise suggest. The style makes it hard to really connect with the characters, and lends such a non-fiction weight to the story in the mixture of real facts and fictitious characters. The pacing also drags a bit  I think due to this style.

For the majority of the novel, I did enjoy it  but the ending takes a bit of a turn that while it wasn't unexpected (some of Camerons secrets are rather obvious), the turn still takes the book in a more political place than I prefer. There are some truly eye-rolling moments here, and while this does fit with the style of journalism today (it all devolves into sex, huh?), it made me completely disengaged and frankly just skimming the end.

I received an ARC of ""Surprise Me"" from NetGalley for an honest review. I wish to thank NetGalley, The Dial Press, and Sophie Kinsella for the opportunity to read this book.

I must confess that this book was NOT anything like I expected!! Normally, with Sophie Kinsella book's, I expect them to just be funny. This book WAS funny - laugh out loud funny. I had to be careful when I read it in bed or I would wake up my husband!! It also had a twisting and turning plot about marriage which made me realize how lucky I am and so was the main character, Sylvia, to have the husbands that we have.

This book is not life-changing, but it is life-lifting. If you want to read a feel-good book that makes you laugh AND makes you think, this book is the ONE for you. Highly recommend!!",1520899200,4,45 star receiv arc surpris netgalley honest review wish thank netgalley dial press sophi kinsella opportun read book must confess book anyth like expect normal sophi kinsella book expect funni book funni laugh loud funni care read bed would wake husband also twist turn plot marriag made realiz lucki main charact sylvia husband book lifechang lifelift want read feelgood book make laugh make think book one highli recommend

29867,1283,540,"The top is where the fixed-mindset people hunger to be, but its where many growth-minded people arrive as a by-product of their enthusiasm for what they do.

If you work in education, whether you are working with toddlers or doctoral students, chances are you are a proponent of growth mindset. It seems logical: if you work in a field that is all about developing people and their minds, you ought to believe in the ability to change, develop, mature, and so on. But what we say and what we do can be very, very different.

I fall into this trap of hypocrisy. I believe that education is valuable to all and everyone has opportunity to benefit but many times my actions or thoughts do not support this thinking. I judge people based on their experiences and not their potential. I have caught myself determining a students success based on weak assumptions. I even do this to myself. Countless times I have decided that I am not gifted at certain activities such as music, art, and math with minimal effort.

I think most educators would claim growth-mindset yet practice fixed mindset towards themselves and their students.

In Dwecks book, Mindset, she not only breaks down the science of mindsets but how this mentality can affect the aspects of our lives: work, relationships, parenting, and school. This book helped me shed an unbecoming light on my faulty thinking and how I can change them. Changing my mindset is a journey and not a one moment, one-day step.
There are many things in my life I am passionate about and I definitely have a growth-mindset in those areas. Bouncing off these activities can help me develop my outlook on every aspect of my life.

This is a great read. Another great installment in the library of positive psychology and peak performance.

Growth-mindset reminds me of this great quote from the venerable Conan OBrien:
It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. It's not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right your perceived failure can become a catalyst for profound re-invention.",1520899200,5,top fixedmindset peopl hunger mani growthmind peopl arriv byproduct enthusiasm work educ whether work toddler doctor student chanc propon growth mindset seem logic work field develop peopl mind ought believ abil chang develop matur say differ fall trap hypocrisi believ educ valuabl everyon opportun benefit mani time action thought support think judg peopl base experi potenti caught determin student success base weak assumpt even countless time decid gift certain activ music art math minim effort think educ would claim growthmindset yet practic fix mindset toward student dweck book mindset break scienc mindset mental affect aspect live work relationship parent school book help shed unbecom light faulti think chang chang mindset journey one moment oneday step mani thing life passion definit growthmindset area bounc activ help develop outlook everi aspect life great read anoth great instal

I haven't read any Piccoult for a while (a little tired of the disease of the month rut she seemed to be in), so I had avoided this book also. But I kept hearing really good things about it. People who didn't read Piccoult LOVED it. So, I gave it a shot.
All those good things I heard were true. This is a good book!  The tale revolves around an African-American nurse. She is a good nurse with a sterling reputation until she is Labor and Delivery nurse to the wife of a white supremacist. This IS a Piccoult book,  so, of course, something terrible happens to the baby.  Now the tale becomes sympathetic (yes, sympathetic) portrayals of a white, racist, perfectly awful man, his white racist, perfectly awful wife and a here-to-for unbiased, wonderful person African-American nurse and her honor roll student , off to Yale son.
You will learn more medical jargon than you ever wanted to know and, maybe, discover a few of your own biases and prejudices.  This is a good story, well told, that will keep you wondering about yourself until the final pages.

29877,855,3790,"I had every intention of reading the first three before this: but that (along with every other plan I made this month) went left and disappeared down the rabbit hole.  But, I didn't have to worry since I was able to follow the story without issues, and delight in the connections made within the book.  Garret is a wonderfully independent, rebellious and intelligent woman with zero care for convention or societal pressures.  Shes a physician with her own successful clinic and little time or patience for fancy society parties or the marriage-mart atmosphere. Shes not interested in marriage or other more traditional paths for women, but shed never thought that it was because she hadnt met the right man.

Ethan Ransom is a man without limits, with a nodding acquaintance with rules, even as he chooses to ignore most of them.  Headstrong, intelligent, capable and accomplished, his tenure with Scotland Yard is over, and hes finding intrigue and interest in a beautiful physician, one that spurns the rigamarole of society as vehemently as he does himself.  Now when the intrigue and danger for him have grown tenfold, hes finding that keeping all these secrets and staying aloof, particularly when Garett is involved and potentially in danger, doesnt seem quite so interesting or fulfilling.

This was a wonderful story of growth and self-realization as both Garrett and Ransom come to discover their attraction is far more than superficial, and that unexpected (and perhaps even once thought unwanted) connections are possibly the best things ever. Both of them are very similar in their disdain for the overblown affectations of society, preferring self-determination and effort to make their ways in the world. While Garrett tilted to the slightly too modern end of the scale for a woman of her time, she was consistent in her beliefs and actions, and her willingness to accept the changes that would include Ransom felt natural and possible.  For his part, Ransom is a wonderfully drawn character: protective, honest, intelligent and not afraid to accept or ask for advice from Garrett, and his moments where he shares his heart are lovely. He fits with Garrett, and she with him, in ways that make them both better people, while giving readers moments to swoon and enjoy.

29878,741,3876,"The Flicker of Old Dreams by Susan Henderson is a very highly recommended lyrical novel about small town outsiders, prejudices, and expectations.

Petroleum, Montana, population 182, is a very small, dying town. It has been in decline for twenty years, ever since the accident that took the life of a local high schooler and shut down the grain elevator, the towns main source of employment. The younger brother of the victim was blamed for his death and sent to live with relatives.

Mary Crampton has lived in Petroleum for thirty years, her whole life, and during those years she has always been a social outcast. Perhaps it is because her father owns the mortuary, or because she grew up without a mother, but Mary has never belonged. Now that she is the embalmer for her father, she is even more set apart from the townspeople around her. She had dreamed of becoming an artist, but now she finds satisfaction in her job, trying to capture the essence of a subjects life.

When Robert Golden, the brother who has been blamed for the town's demise for years, returns to care for his dying mother, old resentments and condemnations return and are all directed at him. In Robert, Mary finds an unexpected soulmate who is also an outsider. Neither Robert nor Mary conform to the expectations of the towns citizens, but Mary's burgeoning friendship and relationship with him shock and dismay the town, while Robert's presence evokes anger and acting out.

The Flicker of Old Dreams is an exquisite, beautifully written, memorable novel. In fact, it is hard to comment on such a well-written novel that seems to capture the very heart and soul of two lonely people who have been considered pariahs by the town, yet are still expected to conform to the will and expectations set by the same people. These are finely detailed, well-developed, and wonderfully crafted characters. The town itself becomes a character, as the inhabitants seem to act as one.

Henderson has created an unforgettable character in Mary - heartbreaking and so tender, caring and loyal to her father and their dying town, even as it sucks the life right out of her.  Anyone who has ever lived as an outsider in a small narrow minded town or in a family of the same ilk will understand Mary's untenable position, where she can never be a part of the town and, really, must find the way to escape in order to truly live her life. Her father, and the town, expect so much from her, mostly to live up to their expectations, and yet give so little in return. The ending is perfect, presenting redemption and hope.

I didn't like Jules. She didn't make sense because I actually don't know what kind of person she is. There is no real characterization, I couldn't tell you what she likes or doesn't. She was annoying, though. Moreover, she is a special snowflake, a trope which I find unacceptable.

The pacing of this book was so slow and nothing really happened, nothing exciting that swept me off my feet.

There is a cool plot twist but to be honest, it didn't impress me very much.

Also, quite a bit of info dumping.

What I did like was the whole time-being-a-currency thing and how throughout the whole book there was this undercurrent mystery feeling to it which bound me to the book. Minimal romance in this book, yay!

29880,2746,462,"When I first picked up this book, I thought ""how interesting can this be? If he's on house arrest, then everything has to happen in the same place."" I'm happy to say that it was incredibly interesting and captivating. The characters were refreshing. I was blown away at how the author illustrated the count as an optimist that still experienced hardship. I know it sounds easy, but the intricacies of his personality and emotions were complex and relatable. I loved that this book wasn't riddle with sexual content, violence, or expletives. There are a couple of instances where you know they had sex, but it does not go into detail. Too often I think people believe you need those elements to make a story worthwhile.

I loved how the author picked out all the tiny details of life to illustrate how exciting and invigorating the little moments can be in our lives when stripped of the unnecessary. This book really was incredible.

I believe this is a modern day classic. It has the feel of something that many generations will learn from. Even the author's writing style is reminiscent of classic literature in the way he references Greek mythology, some long forgotten historical event, or classic literary characters. I love books that teach me more than a moral, or cause me to pause and read up on something. I'm sure there were things that I didn't catch. This might be one of those novels that surprises you when you read it again.

I would recommend it to any young adult or adult. It would be perfect for a book club. There are so many themes, characters, and moments that could be discussed and are very relatable.

29884,1924,3794,"Confession time: I pretty much picked A Princess in Theory up initially because of the absolutely gorgeous color. There's no sense in denying that's what initially drew me to it. I've also been interested in adding some diversity to the romance I'm reading, so that made me want to read it even more. Once I actually read the blurb, I knew I absolutely had to read it. I'm so glad I did, too.

Who doesn't love a good royal romance? I know I do. There's something about the ""regular girl"" and prince/king/whatever pairing that just works for me. The added twist here of Naledi and Thabiso actually being betrothed while they were kids made it even better. It had a definite second chance(ish) feel to it and that's basically catnip to me. From the beginning when Thabiso was lying about his identity and pretending to be a commoner through the time spent together getting to know each other  and themselves, in some respect  again, I loved it all.

The characters were fantastic, too. Ledi was a totally kickass heroine. I'd be friends with her in real life in a heartbeat. I was girl crushing on her pretty hard after only a couple chapters. I appreciated her humor, drive and intelligence. She was so easy to relate to. Thabiso was so freaking swoony I almost didn't know what to do with myself. I'm a total sucker for a hero who is all in and only has eyes for one woman. He totally wore his heart on his sleeve and I loved it.

A Princess in Theory was a hit. It was fun and sexy and even delivered some feels. I can't wait to see what's next for the Reluctant Royals series.

29887,2014,844,"Sometimes I Lie is one of those books that mess with your head. I started reading this book thinking that the book was going in one direction. I wasn't expecting the plot twist at the end of the book. I also didn't expect the mystery of who the second narrator was. The author did a great job keeping that persons identity secret until the end of the book. Any book that can successfully keep plot twists hidden and use red herrings correctly is a book that I recommend to anyone!!

Sometimes I Lies plot starts off with Amber waking up in the hospital. Having no memory of the accident, she realizes that there is something wrong with her. Her fears are confirmed when her husband and sister visit and start discussing why Amber is in a coma. She starts to relive the past few weeks, trying to figure out why she ended up in a coma. She needs to find out what happened leading up to the accident. She needs to remember what happened the night of the accident. She needs to wake up. But will she?

I didn't like Amber at first. Her issues made it very hard to like her. Once the book started getting into her past, my dislike for her started to wane. I started to feel bad for her. She had been through a lot and was starting to heal when the accident happened. But, the more the book went on, the more I realized that Amber caused her own issues. I also realized that Amber wasn't as helpless or a victim as she liked to think she was. My feelings for her at the end of the book were mixed.

I had mixed feelings about the journal entries when they started. At first, I couldn't understand why they were included. But, as the story went on, I began to understand why the author chose to include them. I thought the author was genius for not naming either girl, except for the friends last name. It made me assume things that turned out to be wrong.

Lets talk about plot twists. I love a good plot twist.when they are done right. In Sometimes I Lie, they were definitely done right. I was shocked when things turned out the way they did. And the huge plot twist right at the end. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor.

I would rate Sometimes I Lie for Adults only. There is language, violence, and sex. There is a sexual assault on a bedbound hospital patient. That could trigger people reading the book. There is also a miscarriage scene that could trigger. Depression, anxiety, and OCD are also discussedalong with an unnamed mental illness. I would recommend Sometimes I Lie to family and friends but I would warn about what I listed above. This is a book that I would reread.

Pros of Sometimes I Lie:

Plot twists galore
Not knowing where this book was going to go
The journal entries
Cons of Sometimes I Lie:

Amber. I had mixed feelings about her
Claire and Paul. I couldn't figure out what their relationship was.
The very ending of the book. While I liked it, I didn't want to see a happy ending.

29888,35,2769,"Clearly, AJ Finn was inspired by Paula Hawkins', The Girl On The Train. Even the books' names are similar...The Girl on the Train and The Woman in the Window. Having personally enjoyed The Girl On The Train, I was very curious and excited to read this book, particularly when I saw the massive number of reviews, paired with the very high rating, on both Goodreads and Amazon.

My VERY first thought upon reading the first few pages was that Anna Fox, the narrator, reminded me very much of Sigourney Weaver's agoraphobic, hot-mess of a character, Dr. Helen Hudson, in the film Copycat--both alcoholics, both pill poppers, both agoraphobic, both prone to panic attacks, and both doctors. Crazy, right? Having said that, as the story progressed, I found myself feeling nothing but frustration for Anna. All these crazy things are occurring around her, but she's too gorked out of her head to make any type of difference in her circumstances. I just wanted to scream, ""Put down the wine bottles, quit popping the pills, and please stop freaking lying to every single person you come into contact with, you waste of skin!"" Obviously, Anna got on my nerves.

It wasn't all bad though. I enjoyed Anna's observations about her neighbors. I enjoyed her on-line life and the conversations she had there. I enjoyed the author's ability to bring Anna's confusion and disorientation into a very real light. And I totally enjoyed the super short chapters. It kept the book moving and didn't allow Anna's constant, confused ramblings to become tedious.

But then! Then something even worse than an annoying lead character happened. As I was reading page 236, the entire storyline became crystal clear to me. I knew what the ""twist"" was, I figured out the conclusion, and that, my friends, made me want to cry. I still had 200 pages left to read and I like surprises.

There is another ""big reveal"" about 2/3 of the way through the book. I suppose you could call it a plot twist, but it's quite obvious from the very first chapter of the book.

Just when you think you know what's going on, there's a different twist. The main character is very well portrayed and she's slowly built in a masterful way. The hardest part is that you really never know who to suspect. I suspected some of the betrayals but I also suspected others that never came to be. I love that this book kept me guessing. For my family-minded readers, there's some swearing throughout and a few scenes with sexual content, although it's not overly graphic. There's also a decent amount of violence but, after all, it is a book based on a murder after a one night stand. Some of the descriptions of the violence lean onto a more graphic side but it is pretty tastefully done and not just for shock factor. Overall, if you're not bothered by such things, I would definitely say to give this a try. It will keep you engaged and on your toes!

29894,1137,340,"This book is one long drawn out attack on reason and reality. Harari begins by detailing the three biggest threats humankind has faced through its history- wars, epidemics, and famines. He then explains how much progress we have made in eliminating these threats and poses the question, what next? His answer is that humans will now focus on  immortality, happiness and divinity. So far, so good...somewhat interesting and intriguing. But the book quickly digresses into roaming and chaotic theories, filled with straw men arguments and gross equivocations. All of this absurdity starts to make sense when Harari describes his fundamental philosophy- how he views man, his mind, and existence.

He spends an inordinate amount of time comparing us to the rest of the animal kingdom. He presents some compelling arguments about how humans mistreat animals, sometimes unnecessarily. I gave him the benefit of the doubt in thinking his aim was to help animals, but it soon became obvious his motives are indeed to equalize humans and animals, but not by elevating animals, rather by destroying humans. A strong theme of his book is the impotence of the mind. He considers it beyond argument that humans have no free will- that we are all just algorithms, based on biochemical reactions. He believes data centered non-conscious beings are going to do to us what we have done to animals, and I'm sure he is thrilled.

The book continues on in this anti-intellectual, no free will, pointless meandering, no such thing as individuals, no reality, etc etc for the remainder. Until the end when he suggests everything he says is not for sure and hopes people will read his book and make choices to avoid it (make choices?! what about the entire laughability of us having free will?) The whole thing is absurd. If you want to see the sorry state of what is supposed to be cutting edge thought, read this garbage.

29902,1300,3874,"Wow. Where do I even begin? This is one of my favorite series of all time, and I was so eager and terrified to see it end. Jay and Amie have scripted the most beautiful world, with the most lovable, endearing characters, and I was horrified to see how the war would endbut, above all else, I knew this would be a ride I couldn't miss. I genuinely don't even know how to break this review up, because I don't know how to explain to you all just how much this book meant to me, and how perfectly satisfied I was with it as the ending to our journey.

""Kady looks back and forth between the girls and shrugs.
At least our lives will have been worth dying for.""

 Kady Grant / Ezra Mason 
Our original duo, and quite frankly, my favorites. I loved them in the first book, but we see an entirely different side of the couple in the finale. Theyre exhausted, beaten down, grieving, and full of rage, but they're still clinging to hope. If anyone can put on a strong front and pretend like everything isn't going to hell around them, its these two. Kady is one of my favorite female protagonists of all time, and she didn't let me down. Shes wickedly intelligent, and an emotional powerhouse who manages to ground everyone around her, no matter how bad things get. Ezra is honestly the perfect counterpart to her with his humor and warmth, and I would be the first one in line for a 600-page collection of pure fluff and cuteness between these two.

""And he kisses her like shes the first, last and only thing hell ever need, like hes learning every last part of her. Reverently, like this moment is holy.""

 Hanna Donnelly / Nik Malikov 
I wasn't sure how I would feel about watching the two couples meet and interact with one anotherwould they mesh well? Would it feel natural?but it was honestly perfection. With her astonishing strength and fighting prowess, coupled with her tactical brain and wit, Hanna meshes beautifully with Kady. Nik and Ezra are both our natural pros at banter, and the two of them together? Hilarious. Constantly a bright spot in horrifically dark times, and I loved the reprieve their taunts and jabs offered. Hanna and Nik together, though? I know a common complaint in Gemina reviews is that they didn't know each other well enough to fall for one another, and I won't spoil anything, but that topic is touched on really solidly in this finale, and I applaud the authors for being willing to tackle it on page.

We invaded these peoples homes, Cherry. Bombed them to . Killed their families. You think this isn't a battle? This is a ing war.

 Asha Grant / Rhys Lindstrom 
When I first learned that Asha would be one of our protagonists in Obsidio, I was stunned. Id been perfectly content to count her a loss in the first two books, when Kady mourned the loss of her cousin, but Im really pleased that she was included as a character. She didn't feel quite as three-dimensional as the other girls did to me, but I think that was fully to pin on the fact that this book was non-stop action and suspense with very little time for a lot of character development. Rhys struggled with the same problem, but despite not getting to spend much alone time with either of them, I still enjoyed them tremendously as characters and was certainly rooting for them throughout the entire thing. Theres a sub-plot arc with Asha and a little girl shes rescued named Katya, and the maternal vibes it gave off? Everything.

""I feaR this ship will neeD knives soon, Little SpiDeR.""

 Ella Malikova 
Everyones favorite little hacker girl did not fail to impress in this installment. I absolutely adored Ella in Gemina and desperately hoped she would get a substantial amount of screen time in the finale, so I was beyond ecstatic to spend so much time with her. True to her nature, she is still hilarious, snarky, and brilliant with a keyboardbut she also develops in the sense that we see her develop an affection for Hanna that is sisterly and precious. I love my little Spider girl, and what I wouldnt give for a whole spin-off about her.

""She cradles me to her breast
and I cannot feel the warmth of her skin.
Cannot hold her as she holds me.
And I cannot recall ever feeling so alone.
< error >""

 Artificial Intelligence Defense Analytics Network 
I am without words. AIDAN plays such a tremendously fascinating role in this storytruly, it would be nothing without its logic, vicious honesty, and fiercely protective nature of Kady, the last of which we see bloom quickly in this final installment. If you noticed AIDAN growing more human-like and emotional in Gemina, just wait until Obsidio, where we get to see it depict humor, sorrow, loneliness, and even jealousy. Theres nothing that I can really tell you about AIDAN without offering up a million spoilers for this finale, so Ill just say that, if you love AIDAN even half as much as I do, I don't think a single part of you will be disappointed by this book.

""I know their names.
I
know
their
faces.""

 supporting cast 
There are a million and one characters in each installment of this story, and Obsidio is no different, but they each feel so complex and unique and perfectly human that I am consistently stunned by how easy it is to keep them all apart. We have entire spaceships and armies full of supporting characters, so Ill just name a few favorites:

 Isaac Grant: #SquadDad goals for life. Weve got a crew full of orphans running around at this point, and Isaac doesnt hesitate to take them all under his wing. I have probably never loved a parental figure in any YA story half as much as I love him, and I spent the entire book laughing and crying over his pep talks, jokes, and desperate attempts to make everyone stop swearing.

 Duke Wozniak: Ah, The Duke. One of Rhys co-soldiers, he refers to himself in the third person, is missing half of his tongue, and sleeps in full armor no matter what. I love this guy. I know hes on the wrong side of things in the story, but hes a fantastic example of how there are people on both sides who don't have bad intentionstheyre just doing what they can to survive.

 Yukiko Oshiro: Rhys sergeant and shadow, responsible for keeping him out of trouble at all costs. This poor woman is shown from the beginning to be in so far over her head that shes doing everything she can to stay afloat, no matter what it takes. Despite how much I wanted to dislike her for some of her decisions, I couldn't help but constantly root for her and hope she would see the light.

The die is cast. But today we will shake the table upon which it lands.

 action and war 
While the other two books had plenty of scenes that were written for character development, or plotting, or explaining the ins and outs of spacetime, dimensions, ships, etc., Obsidio comes in with a hook and doesnt relent until the very end. There is so much action and tension in this story that I literally spent the last 150 pages with a feeling of nausea I couldn't quite shake. There were pages that left me trembling, sobbing so hard I could not think straightmuch less see the words on the pages. I cannot express to you how invested I was in this story, and how desperate I became to reach the end and see where the die would fall. The final battle was scripted so fluidly and to utter perfection; I could not, and would not, have asked for more.

""I am not good.
Nor am I evil.
I am no hero.
Nor am I villain.
< error >
< error >
I
am
AIDAN.""

 final thoughts 
If my incessant gushing and compliments to Jay and Amies storyweaving has not been enough to sell you on this book, I cant think of a single other thing I could say to do the job, honestly. As I mentioned at the start, The Illuminae Files is, without question, one of my favorite series in life, and I can only count one or two other series in the world whose finales have pleased me as much as Obsidio did. I cannot recommend this series, and this book, highly enough, and I sincerely hope that you will give it a try.

First, the positives:  author Bart Ehrman is clearly a biblical and early Christian expert. (I am certainly not.)  He fully discloses his beliefs (he has moved from an evangelical christian to a non-believer over his lifetime).  His writing is commendably neutral - he is good at keeping his opinion out of the factual story.  And I learned a LOT about the 300 to 400 years following Jesus's lifetime.  The development of Christianity is covered in detail.  Now the negatives.  For me, it boils down to drowning in repetitive detail.  After a while, the facts and repetition became overwhelming.

Lies and deception are commonplace for both, leaving the reader without a reliable narrator to anchor the story.  As a private investigator with enough information about his target to make any person wary, Adam nevertheless becomes involved way more than his real-life counterpart would.

29910,637,2838,"If I Die Tonight is Alison Gaylin's newest release. This was a first read of this author for me, but it won't be the last.

Small town USA. An aging pop star who goes by the name Amie Em stumbles in the local police station, saying she was carjacked by a teenaged boy. Another boy named Liam tried to stop the theft and was critically injured. But her story keeps changing and there are gaping holes in her recounting of the crime. The finger is inevitably pointed at Wade - a high school outcast.

Gaylin mirrors today's society- much of the case is debated online in various social forums. The presumption of innocent until proven guilty doesn't figure into the diatribe.. A young man's life is irrevocably changed and the injured teen becomes a downed hero to the town.

But is Wade guilty? He refuses to speak about that night. His mother Jackie knows he is not capable of such an act. Or is he? Gaylin tells this story through many points of view, giving the reader options as to what the outcome might be. I felt for Jackie as she struggled to clear her son's name. Gaylin's depictions of her emotions and relationships with her sons was well done. But my favourite supporting character was Officer Pearl Maze. She has her own issues, but was the clearest thinking character for me. (And I'd really like to see her in another book.)

Gaylin provides red herrings and alternative outcomes along the way to the final whodunit. I admit to having my suspicions about one character, who was just a little too calm and helpful for me. And yes, they did figure into the final reveal. But, that in no way detracted from my enjoyment of If I Die Tonight.

29913,4828,765,"Jo Nesbo seems to need a change in his prose as soon as possible and the reason is that the infamous Harry Hole series is gradually declining in quality terms. ''The Thirst'' is an enjoyable book, but it lacks the shining of Nesbo's masterpieces (''The Redbreast'', ''The Redeemer''; ''Phantom'') as the Norwegian super-star writer repeats his writing style, and as a consequence  the readers of all the previous books will feel bored in some parts of this novel. As far as the story is concerned, the book tries to tie up the loose ends from the previous novel (''Police'') and the reader has the opportunity to learn more about the Valentin killings which cover a major part of it. Of course, as usual in a Nesbo crime novel, there are plenty of twists and sub-stories but they also feel contrived as they seem to try to force a variety of feelings out of the reader. The whodunit part is also nearly ridiculous as one can guess from the first 100-150 pages the real villain.

Cassie Bowden is a flight attendant and has been for many years. She's single because her one true love is alcohol. Cassie is a binge drinker, an alcoholic that passes out and has reached the point of blacking out on numerous occasions.

29917,812,3508,"What a fabulous book. I adored The French Girl in all of its twists and turns and mysterious glory. It was just the right blend of anxiety and thrills that keep me reading this genre.

Kate was such a delightful heroine. Ive had my fill of the unlikeable, drunk, unreliable narrator and was so glad to finally have a lead character that I actually liked. She and Severine made the book perfection for me.

I found myself thinking about this book and hurrying back to it every time I had to put it down. And there were a couple of nights that I had to go back and reread because Id slept through several pages, I call this Sleep Reading - believe me its a thing - because even though I obviously was tired and needed to sleep, I just couldn't bear to put the book away. This is the hallmark of a fabulous book for me!

I highly recommend this book to lovers of psychological suspense with a heroine that you actually love and a mystery that keeps you guessing until the very last pages.

Four bombs explode inside a high school. Seven students trapped. One is the bomber. Another one gun has a gun. A senators daughter. A bullied girl. A Muslim. A mixed race gay football player. Another gay football player who also plays straight. An orphan and the girl trying to save him from himself. Not all will survive.

Long before Parkland, I preordered TIME BOMB, a different take on school shooting meets The Breakfast Club. Joelle Charbonneau uses six third person points of view to lay out the moment by moment story which takes place over six hours (not including the epilogue). While TIME BOMB held my interest, I didn't feel invested in the students and the story lacked tension possibly due to so many characters.

I spent the first parts of the book thinking Im going to be SO MAD if Charbonneau makes Rashid the bomber. Soon I had a different suspect, which turned out to be right (as well as obvious and unrealistic).

29925,2543,3863,"Overall, an interesting look at the history of the Cold War and particularly the history of both Europe and the Soviet Union--both in the days of the Russian empire (the concept of colonialism in general is heavily explored throughout the book in respect to Russia but also in respect to Europe in general, with the post-World War II Europe eventually trading its colonial past for an integration focused future, which is what propelled the EU into existence), the Soviet Union, and eventually the Russian Federation (with a particular focus on its last two decades).

A lot of time is spent on analysis--both of the vulnerabilities of European democracy (which resulted in Brexit, gave the French nationalist and anti-EU candidate Marine Le Pen the biggest percentage of votes that her party has gotten since World War II in the recent French elections, and heavily impacted the U.S. elections), dangers of dictatorship (associated with fake elections, legislation which constantly prolongs the presidential term, etc.), and the imperialism mindset in general (which is that led to countless conflicts, spread prejudices, and was especially apparent in World War II, where countries were annexed and invaded, stripped of their sovereignty).

I found this book to be lengthy and detailed, with a very long list of references in the End Notes section. If you're interested in the history of the power war between the East and the West (which has continued on regardless of the Cold War ending) and the various instruments used on both sides (though the book focuses more on Russia than the West--i.e. propaganda, the positioning of the other side as needlessly decadent and morally dangerous, etc.), this is an interesting analysis of it.",1520985600,4,overal interest look histori cold war particularli histori europ soviet unionboth day russian empir concept coloni gener heavili explor throughout book respect russia also respect europ gener postworld war ii europ eventu trade coloni past integr focus futur propel eu exist soviet union eventu russian feder particular focu last two decad lot time spent analysisboth vulner european democraci result brexit gave french nationalist antieu candid marin le pen biggest percentag vote parti gotten sinc world war ii recent french elect heavili impact u elect danger dictatorship associ fake elect legisl constantli prolong presidenti term etc imperi mindset gener led countless conflict spread prejudic especi appar world war ii countri annex invad strip sovereignti found book lengthi detail long list refer end note section your interest histori power war east west continu regardless cold war end variou instrument use side though book focus russia westi propaganda posit side needlessli decad moral danger etc interest analysi
29926,2354,3830,"Though he had shown no signs of depression, Clare's father jumped to his death at Beachy Head. Seven months later, overwhelmed with grief, Clare's mother copied his suicide to a T and jumped from the same point. Now, a year later Clare is struggling to understand how her parents would choose to leave her in such a traumatic way. It doesn't feel right so when a Happy Anniversary card arrives through the mail slot on the first anniversary of her mother's death with only the cryptic message ""Suicide? Think Again."" Clare becomes convinced that her parents were murdered. She takes the card to the police where she meets Murray, a retired detective who works the desk as a civilian now. Murray is sure the detectives won't give the card much consideration but is moved with compassion toward Clare and decides to look into the case of the double suicides himself.

It becomes clear that someone doesn't want Clare looking into the suicides. It's too dangerous. Though she loved them dearly, Clare had no idea the secrets her parents were keeping.

Let Me Lie by Clare Mackintosh is a thriller that kept me up late at night. It's one of those books where I would tell Rand ""just let me finish this chapter"" but then I couldn't help but start the next one and soon he was snoring. Mackintosh keeps the action flowing while creating intriguing characters. She's skilled at throwing suspicion on everyone and throwing plot twists just at the moment I thought I'd figured it out. It's ominous and scary without being gruesome or horrific.

Mackintosh combines her experience on the police force with her skills as a storyteller to create a gripping thriller that is actually plausible.

29927,1410,3830,"Both parents committing suicide at the same exact spot seven months apart seemed a bit strange.  Anna extremely missed both her parents but didn't know how much until a horrible reminder arrived in the mail.

This horrible reminder had Anna rethinking the possibility that her parents really didn't commit suicide but had been murdered.  She never thought her parents would kill themselves and leave her without them.

Anna asked for the case to be reopened, and a retired policeman, Murray, was taking on the job.

No one knew Anna had asked for this case to be re-opened, but it sure seemed as if they did.  Strange things started happening that even her husband dismissed.  Was she in danger too?

Meanwhile we have another voice being heard in the book.  The voice is the voice of Anna's mother watching Anna and being elated that she has a grandchild and also not very happy that Anna was digging into papers that might put Anna in danger depending upon what she would find.

Annas mother does some odd things like going into the house when it is empty and looking for things and specifically a key.  What could the key be, why is it important to her, and how is she in the house if she is dead?

After this, the intrigue began...secrets were being revealed, impossible things happening, ghosts, seeing things that couldn't be there, feeling her mothers presence, and the reader wondering what Annas mother was looking for and what she was trying to protect Anna from or protect herself from.

LET ME LIE has GREAT twists and is another Clare Mackintosh book you won't want to miss.  You won't see it coming and ask yourself how you missed it.

29928,4247,3830,"First of all, many thanks to Berkley Publishing Group for providing me with an advance review copy of this book via Edelweiss AND a physical copy! All opinions are my own.

There are a lot of mixed reviews out there for Let Me Lie, but I am so glad I read it. It is very obvious to me that Clare Mackintosh has A LOT of talent. I both gasped and cried during this book, and there were so many things that happened that I was not expecting. It was my first time reading a book by Mackintosh, but it definitely won't be my last.

Viewpoints alternate through Anna, an unknown (ghost?), and a retired detective named Murray. After Anna receives a mysterious card she reaches out to Murray who is now working as a civilian at a desk job for the local police station. She wants her parent's suicide cases reopened because she now believes her parents were murdered... DUN DUN DUN.

This is definitely a slow burner (some people might say too slow?), but it definitely picks up after part 2. A lot of people found the book to be predictable, but I didn't see anything coming. I think that Mackintosh does a great job of throwing suspicion on lots of different people, and she sure had me fooled. At the end I suspected everyone except who it actually was.

I also liked that she spent a lot of time on Murray's character. I really got to know that retired cop, and I felt really bad for him and his wife (you'll see why). This book touches on mental illness with them and that was an aspect I wasn't expecting.

Final Thought: Due to the drastically varying reviews on this book, I say it is best to read it yourself. I personally feel like it was worth the read and I know I'm not the only one out there. It wasn't the most amazing book ever, but it kept me interested and I really enjoyed it. There are some bits that are a little confusing, and it could be seen as a little slow, but I still had a very good overall experience with the book.",1520985600,4,first mani thank berkley publish group provid advanc review copi book via edelweiss physic copi opinion lot mix review let lie glad read obviou clare mackintosh lot talent gasp cri book mani thing happen expect first time read book mackintosh definit wont last viewpoint altern anna unknown ghost retir detect name murray anna receiv mysteri card reach murray work civilian desk job local polic station want parent suicid case reopen believ parent murder dun dun dun definit slow burner peopl might say slow definit pick part 2 lot peopl found book predict didnt see anyth come think mackintosh great job throw suspicion lot differ peopl sure fool end suspect everyon except actual also like spent lot time murray charact realli got know retir cop felt realli bad wife youll see book touch mental ill aspect wasnt expect final thought due drastic vari review book say best read

 I am still supremely PISSED that because of all the Dani backlash after Iced we never got the story that KMM meant to tell. I won't even rehash that terrible BOOK thing that happened in Feversong with Mac.

We could have had SO. MUCH. MORE.

Anyways, enough of me being crazy. Dani is probably my favorite of the female characters that KMM has written. I mean a strong, confident woman who fears a guy that could rip her heart to shreds? Let's just condemn her as annoying why don't we? Okay, I'll stop now I promise.

This story revolves around Dani being practically left alone for a few years after the events of the last book. New threats come along and pretty soon no one can help Dani, not even Ryodan. This book gets all the stars just for those angst filled moments between him and Dani, and all of the verbal sparring moments between them as well. KMM has a very unique and creepy imagination and I can honestly say I would never want to live in her head. I do hope we get more of Dani and Ryodan in the future. I am even wildly hoping for a Lor book. Can that be a thing please????

Anyways, if you don't hate Dani (and are basically awesome) you will enjoy this book.

29944,642,3881,"17th Suspect by James Patterson is the 17th in the Women's Murder Club series, and this time the focus is mainly on Yuki Castellano and a solid case that had gone to trial - one she was sure she would win - and Sergeant Lindsay Boxer's determination to bring a killer to justice.

When Lindsay was approached by a woman with information about murders that were occurring among the homeless, Lindsay and her partner Rich Conklin made some discoveries that Lindsay found unpalatable. Crossing the jurisdiction line was something they didn't do - but it had to be done.

While Yuki was confident of a result, the nature of the trial was unusual. And her opposing counsel was eager to get under Yuki's skin. What would be the outcome for the people involved?

And what would be the result for Lindsay? She was putting herself in danger and her friends in the Murder Club were trying to convince her to let it go. But that wasn't in her nature...

I thoroughly enjoyed 17th Suspect; right up there with the previous titles.

29946,564,1972,"This is a book that I had been dying to read but just hadnt made the time because it was a book I wanted to be able to give my complete attention to with no interruptions. I was enamored with the relationship between Audrey Rose and Thomas in the previous book, Stalking Jack the Ripper, and I was excited to see how their relationship was going to fare after the reveal of who had been behind the Jack the Ripper killings. At the start of Hunting Prince Dracula Audrey had not been coping very well with the previous events that had taken place but was trying to keep up the appearance that she was doing okay.

Audrey Roses deepest desire had been for the longest time to attend the Academy of Forensic Medicine and Science at Bran Castle located in the Transylvania Region of Romania, a dream that she never considered would be a possibility until it became one. Not only had she been accepted there but so had Thomas. Together they would journey to their location but not without difficulties. As they traveled on the Orient Express there was a murder and it affected Audrey Rose deeper than it ever would have before. Can I tell you how much I enjoyed that there was a murder on the Orient Express?! ha ha ha!

Although she understood that the Ripper killings had affected her deeply, Audrey was in denial about her feelings that made encounters of a forensic nature very disturbing for her. Not something that she accepted very well but she was determined not to let it handicap her now that they had reached Bran Castle. Thomas for his part was trying to help Audrey Rose but his attempts to help often made the situation for Audrey Rose worse and caused distance to occur between the two characters. Though, when a spree of killings that appeared to be vampiric in nature started taking place, Audrey Rose and Thomas put differences aside in order to investigate the allegations that Vlad the Impaler had risen again.

The mystery element was such a wonderful part of this story! Taking in the information regarding the murders and trying to find the common element, so much fun! The discussion of dissection and pathology was still a bit of a stomach turner and the ending scene where everything was revealed was both nauseating and fascinating! I am so on board for the next book in this series! The romance development between Audrey Rose and Thomas did not disappoint at all, well there were plenty of times where I wanted to shout KISS ALREADY! but by the end I was all sorts of awwwww.

29950,2658,2962,"Plot: As a young girl, would-be Iranian poetess (the author's word) Forugh Farrokhzad chafes at the restrictions placed upon her and her older sister as females growing up in a repressive society. Though her brothers are allowed out past their garden walls to roam and play games in the street, she is forced to remain inside the balcony. Early on, Forugh, the daughter of an abusive military father, seeks to find ways to subvert her parents' and her society's rules. Influenced by the frequent talk and quotes of poetry she hears eavesdropping on her father's gatherings, Forugh begins reading widely and composing her own. She also bribes her sister to keep quiet, as she makes excursions away from their home, and after she becomes a teenager, meets and develops a relationship with a handsome boy who is also a poet. When her mother learns of her daughter's deception, she insists on bringing the young Forugh to have her virginity checked, an occurrence that will wind up haunting her as she eventually marries and faces an imperfect relationship in a secluded village far from her Tehran home. Discontented with traditional married life as well as regarded by suspicion by the other women nearby, Forugh begins to send poems to literary journals, a route which will cause her to find romance and career success, as well as make a friend who becomes a kindred spirit, but also lose things that are dear to her and become the target of hostile gossip. When political unrest arrives in Tehran, Forugh finds herself in the midst of the controversy in a way that will eventually put her life in danger and make her redefine just what is worth fighting for.

Thoughts: At first I felt like I had read this story before, but after Forugh marries and her fortune takes a turn for the worse - similar to what happened to poet Janet Frame in ""An Angel at My Table,"" my interested was piqued. The plight of a young woman who was institutionalized for the sin of wanting an independent adult literary life, has been duplicated by other famous women creators as well, but I still found it both infuriating and fascinating. Forugh's life after she is released and begins a career as a filmmaker documenting women's lives in a leper colony also held my attention. Even though sometimes the pace lagged, I was glad I had read this account of a formerly unknown (to me) feminist who made a powerful difference while she was alive.",1520985600,4,plot young girl wouldb iranian poetess author word forugh farrokhzad chafe restrict place upon older sister femal grow repress societi though brother allow past garden wall roam play game street forc remain insid balconi earli forugh daughter abus militari father seek find way subvert parent societi rule influenc frequent talk quot poetri hear eavesdrop father gather forugh begin read wide compos also bribe sister keep quiet make excurs away home becom teenag meet develop relationship handsom boy also poet mother learn daughter decept insist bring young forugh virgin check occurr wind haunt eventu marri face imperfect relationship seclud villag far tehran home discont tradit marri life well regard suspicion woman nearbi forugh begin send poem literari journal rout caus find romanc career success well make friend becom kindr spirit also lose thing dear becom target hostil gossip polit unrest arriv tehran forugh find midst controversi way eventu put life danger make redefin worth fight thought first felt like read stori forugh

29955,1213,557,"The Martian is out of this world! Riveting and captivating, this one is sure to blow you away! It is perfect for those who love a slow burn of a novel with a high amount of realism and humor!

This one was so good! I actually took my time reading it so I could savor it. In the past I had found that after letting a book sit for a few days I had to look back at what I had previously read to refresh my memory. I did not find that I needed to do that with this one. The story was so memorable, that every time I picked it back up, I remembered everything from my last reading session, and was able to just sit and enjoy it!

Andy Weir created a stunning story about hope and struggle. Mark Watney, ""space pirate,"" was such a dynamic, strong character! He was brave, vulnerable, and full of ingenuity! He was highly intelligent, and full of humor and sarcasm!

If you've seen the movie already (like me), you'll have a good idea of how the plot goes, but the book went in to so much more detail than the movie did. It broke down all the science. It delved deeper in to the emotional aspect of being the sole inhabitant of Mars. It offered more humor and ""Macguyvering,"" and it held more realism!

The book started a tad slow for me, but it quickly picked up and had me fully invested in Watney, and the NASA crew's life saving efforts. Watney was the star! I mean, obviously, being the only person on the planet, he was kind of it for most of the book. But, not only did we get a play by play of life on Mars from Watney's journal entries, we also got a third person view every so often when Watney did something that caused his almost death, and we got the points of view of the Hermes crew, and NASA.

I just loved every aspect of the story! The science was detailed enough to get my mind working, but simple enough to not deter me. The humor and sarcasm was through the roof, and was, by far, the best aspect of the story! Watney's personality and intelligence shined throughout the entire book, and the courage of the crew of the Hermes was heart warming! The Martian was just so darn entertaining! 4.5 stars.",1520985600,5,martian world rivet captiv one sure blow away perfect love slow burn novel high amount realism humor one good actual took time read could savor past found let book sit day look back previous read refresh memori find need one stori memor everi time pick back rememb everyth last read session abl sit enjoy andi weir creat stun stori hope struggl mark watney space pirat dynam strong charact brave vulner full ingenu highli intellig full humor sarcasm youv seen movi alreadi like youll good idea plot goe book went much detail movi broke scienc delv deeper emot aspect sole inhabit mar offer humor macguyv held realism book start tad slow quickli pick fulli invest watney nasa crew life save effort watney star mean obvious person planet kind book get play play life mar watney journal

She undergoes a kind of internal and external makeover to address Miss D's wishes on how to dress, walk, shake hands, and speak, but the rewards for her behavior and work as an assistant - vacations and opportunities around the world, meeting celebrities, heartfelt gifts and letters from Miss D, and an overflow of love and guidance - far outweighs the typical turmoil of a job and makes it more like a life's worth of experience within a single career.

29958,1204,3126,"British writer Matt Haig, writer of myriad genres for readers of diverse age groups, has turned his hand to a time travel novel, How To Stop Time, and carried it off with panache.  Tom Hazard, the protagonist, looks like he is in his late thirties/early forties, but he is really 400 years old:  You see, I have a condition,  he tells us at the beginning of the book.. I am old  old in the way that a tree, or a quahog clam, or a Renaissance painting is old. I was born well over four hundred years ago, on the third of March 1581  For every 13 or 14 human years, he ages one year.

As the novel opens the year is 2017, and Hazards long life (Dont you love his name?) has brought him interesting experiences, but only one period of true happiness when he fell in love with an apple seller in London named Rose in the 17th century, and had a daughter named Marion.  I just didn't like my condition. It made me lonely. And when I say lonely, I mean the kind of loneliness that howls through you like a desert wind. It wasn't just the loss of people I had known but also the loss of myself. The loss of who I had been when I had been with them.

Hazard must move every 8 years, so that people don't get suspicious about the fact that he doesnt seem to age.  In 2017,he moves back to the portion of London that he had lived in with Rose in the 1600s ( and worked for Shakespeare in) to teach 14 year olds history.

His commentary about modern life isn't flattering:  I look around. Trying to work out where it is that I first saw her. It is beyond impossible. There is nothing recognisable. As with Chapel Street and Well Lane, not a single building that is there now was there then. I see, through a window, a row of people running on treadmills. They are all staring up at what I assume is a row of TV screens above their heads. Some of them are plugged into headphones. One is checking her iPhone as she runs.

Places don't matter to people any more. Places aren't the point. People are only ever half present where they are these days. They always have at least one foot in the great digital nowhere.

Part of the fun of time travel novels is that the characters, of course, cross paths with famous people from times gone by.  The following fictional quote from the author F. Scott Fitzgerald is notable:  If only we could find a way to stop time...Thats what we need to work on. You know, for when a moment of happiness floats along. We could swing our net and catch it like a butterfly, and have that moment for ever.

Part of what makes the novel readable, however, is the fact that Hazard is just an ordinary person who has lived an extraordinarily long life, and that Haig is good at helping the reader identify with his pathos.

I read that the movie rights have already been bought and that it is  already in development with Benedict Cumberbatch producing and starring.  But, I recommend traveling though time by reading the book.

29959,1318,382,"pooled ink Reviews:

Overall I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story and I absolutely look forwards to reading what comes next. Jude has made her play and Cardan has not long until he can break his chains and make his. I cannot wait to see what it might be, for time makes fickle things of us all.

The one thing I wasn't overly impressed with was some of the predictability in the plot and in the characters. This is definitely one of those books where if something seems too good to be true (particularly in the cruel world of Faerie) then it is. Every time. However I will say that the predictability tended to lie in the major moves, the cleverness hid in the details. So while I could guess what turn or ""twist"" the plot might make at major points, Jude was always a mystery and this is why she was such a fantastic character to read and why I greatly anticipate the sequel.

Wickedly delightful and seductively clever, THE CRUEL PRINCE spins a tale of faerie and what a small mortal girl might do if willing to do anything at all. Captivating, conspiring, and as all-consuming as faerie fruit on human lips, this stunning fantasy will leave you gasping for more.

29960,2400,1179,"I originally thought that The Darkling Bride was going to be a ghost story, something out of my comfort zone but so tantalizing that I was willing to try. Turns out it's a little bit about a ghostly legend and mostly about bizarre family events that only add to the legend.

There are three timelines and several points of view working in tandem to bring this incredible story to life. I love a good mystery and so happens I love one that involves uncovering family secrets. Carragh takes on a temporary job to archive the Gallagher family's library before the castle is put in a trust. Aidan, the current Viscount, has no desire to hold on to the castle where his parents were murdered. What few memories he has are too painful and since not everyone in his family is in agreement with his plans, their discord grows as time wears on. Carragh gets to be an unwilling witness to the family's drama but doesn't allow that to distract her from doing the work she was hired to do. She's also doing a bit of her own research into one of the family's most famous ancestors and her perseverance leads her to information that could help resolve not only the mystery of Aidan's parents' deaths but another one from a couple of generations back.

With so many characters and details involved Andersen has paced the story perfectly with concise chapters and just enough breadcrumbs to keep both the plotline and reader moving forward. The only problem I had was with real life constantly interrupting my reading bliss. The Darkling Bride fits a certain kind of mood and I was craving a mystery like this that would remove me to another setting and time period. I was mesmerized by the story and enjoyed the various characters even when they were at their most vulnerable. If I could make a wish, I'd love to see the detective, Sibal in another story. Strong and skilled at her job, it would be fun to see her work another mystery but as I said, that's just my wishful thinking.",1520985600,4,origin thought darkl bride go ghost stori someth comfort zone tantal will tri turn littl bit ghostli legend mostli bizarr famili event add legend three timelin sever point view work tandem bring incred stori life love good mysteri happen love one involv uncov famili secret carragh take temporari job archiv gallagh famili librari castl put trust aidan current viscount desir hold castl parent murder memori pain sinc everyon famili agreement plan discord grow time wear carragh get unwil wit famili drama doesnt allow distract work hire she also bit research one famili famou ancestor persever lead inform could help resolv mysteri aidan parent death anoth one coupl gener back mani charact detail involv andersen pace stori perfectli concis chapter enough breadcrumb keep plotlin reader move forward problem real life constantli interrupt read bliss darkl bride fit certain kind mood crave mysteri like would remov anoth set time period mesmer stori

29965,3675,2595,"This standalone YA sci-fi brings a few very ambitious elements to the table that help bolster its weaknesses and make this a pretty enjoyable read overall. While other books have been written about communities with genetic engineering and institutionalized segmentation (The Giver, Divergent), Your One & Only dives more into the actual science, which was one of my favorite aspects. Don't worry, it's not overly ""sciency,"" but it does address things like the fact that you can't keep copying the same genetic sample without it degrading, and it speaks plainly about gene splicing, if in a simplistic and fantastical way (ex. integrating pineapple flavor into pork). I liked the setup of having nine archetypes of humanity; the fact that they all read as a little bit of a caricature (especially when there are multiples of the same type all together) was both a plus and minus. It made them feel flat, but that's also the point of the whole book - that individuality is not a weakness. Jack's anger was very believable, and his emotions are a nice contrast to the clones. The ending wasn't rushed, making this a satisfying read for those interested.",1520985600,3,standalon ya scifi bring ambiti element tabl help bolster weak make pretti enjoy read overal book written commun genet engin institution segment giver diverg one dive actual scienc one favorit aspect dont worri overli scienci address thing like fact cant keep copi genet sampl without degrad speak plainli gene splice simplist fantast way ex integr pineappl flavor pork like setup nine archetyp human fact read littl bit caricatur especi multipl type togeth plu minu made feel flat that also point whole book individu weak jack anger believ emot nice contrast clone end wasnt rush make satisfi read interest
29966,4761,33,"Holy Story Batman! I should start off by saying that I mostly read thrillers and suspense novels. I haven't read a ton of scifi. When it comes to love stories, I read those when I'm feeling something lighter. Well, this book was all 3 in one but in the best way possible. I absolutely loved this book and honestly I wish it never ended.

We meet Jason and his family: Daniela his wife and Charlie his teenage son. it seems like a pretty typical family dynamic. Jason goes out to celebrate with a friend without his family but ends up getting abducted by a stranger. He's told to drive the car to a certain address and don't ask any questions. He's knocked unconscious, wakes up to someone say ""Welcome back, My friend."" Jason is BEYOND confused at this point and this is where the story starts to play out. Is this his real home? What universe is this? Where is his family? Who are these people and how do they know me? and the biggest questions of all How in the world did I get here???""

We watch Jason go through different scenarios in his life and how things may have played out within the multiverse. I can't help but also love this book because it's based in Chicago where I've lived the last 10 years!

Underneath the short chapters, which makes it thrilling, and the scifi theme this book really is a love story of Jason and Daniela. It questions what is their normal and how can you be certain someone is who they say they are.

SO many people recommended I read this book because they told me they loved it. I was skeptical about this because like i said, scifi isn't normally my thing. I'm more of a logic based person rather than an imaginative one. Let me just say that this got my creative wheels turning and I just loved it so much.

If you like thrillers and are willing to read something with scifi and love elements intertwined then I would recommend picking this one up!",1520985600,5,holi stori batman start say mostli read thriller suspens novel havent read ton scifi come love stori read im feel someth lighter well book 3 one best way possibl absolut love book honestli wish never end meet jason famili daniela wife charli teenag son seem like pretti typic famili dynam jason goe celebr friend without famili end get abduct stranger he told drive car certain address dont ask question he knock unconsci wake someon say welcom back friend jason beyond confus point stori start play real home univers famili peopl know biggest question world get watch jason go differ scenario life thing may play within multivers cant help also love book base chicago ive live last 10 year underneath short chapter make thrill scifi theme book realli love stori jason daniela question normal certain someon say mani peopl recommend read book told love skeptic like said scifi isnt normal thing im

29972,4939,877,"I liked One Second After, One Year After, The Windup Girl, Ready Player One, The Hunger Games, and other tales better than this story. I didn't watch the movie.

I'm always reading some good fantasy or science fiction. This month I'm rereading my favorite five military sci-fi classics: Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein (1959), The Forever War by Joe Haldeman (1974), Armor by John Steakley (1984), Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card (1985), and Old Man's War by John Scalzi (2005).

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010).

29974,4936,22,"American Wolf by Nate Blakeslee is a free NetGalley ebook that I read in late January.

While reading American Wolf, it felt like I was entering the world of my boyfriend's father, a man with deep-seated interest in the wolves of Yellowstone where each wolf is known by name, lineage, and migration. It's a little bit intimidating, but it's a world I want to understand, even if it means approaching it from the perspective of one of its most renown members, O-Six (granddaughter of Druid-21, the beloved favorite of my boyfriend's father). Due to this prevalent bias, it was immediately easy to both side against anti-wolf hunters and to mentally reconstruct the lay of Yellowstone's landscape as the author describes it (especially the Lamar Valley and Silver Gate). It was also easy to empathize with the narration on the matriculation, coming-of-age, and interactivity amid the packs over time (Druid-21 being the father and provider to a whole generation of wolves, sadness at the attack or trapping of an elder or weaker wolf, living through times of feast and famine, and migration to populated, lethal, anti-wolf areas).",1520985600,4,american wolf nate blakesle free netgalley ebook read late januari read american wolf felt like enter world boyfriend father man deepseat interest wolv yellowston wolf known name lineag migrat littl bit intimid world want understand even mean approach perspect one renown member osix granddaught druid21 belov favorit boyfriend father due preval bia immedi easi side antiwolf hunter mental reconstruct lay yellowston landscap author describ especi lamar valley silver gate also easi empath narrat matricul comingofag interact amid pack time druid21 father provid whole gener wolv sad attack trap elder weaker wolf live time feast famin migrat popul lethal antiwolf area

29976,3365,25,"""When we think of the past its the beautiful things we pick out. We want to believe it was all like that.""

This is one of my favorite quotes from this book, and yet it's far from true.

The book is a recounting of a lone woman's tale in a dark, future part of the world. It's a merging of evils - environmental destruction, widespread infertility, discrimination by religious beliefs, all blamed on the wiles and evils of loose, liberated women and the men who allowed them to become that way.

Given the basics of world history, much of the tale rings eerily true, pulling different awful moments together to create this narrative. Slavery, the Holocaust, public executions, and the days before most civil rights combine to create a possible future that has been a must read for decades.

The narrator tells her story in turn, moving from her present to her past, seemingly amazed that they both coexist. She speaks to an unknown audience, apologizing for parts of the tale, and admitting when her imagination gets away from her, wishing for things that cannot be or cannot return.

While not the first time I've read this tale, I pull different things from it each time. Rather than earlier readings, feeling the raw emotion that it can inspire, I analyzed more this time, mentally tracking sources of inspiration and how the novel was woven together so neatly, complete with a sociologist's analysis at the end.

Could this world happen?  It already does - and did - on certain levels, in certain places in the world.  That's part of what makes it both ring true, and so compelling.",1520985600,5,think past beauti thing pick want believ like one favorit quot book yet far true book recount lone woman tale dark futur part world merg evil environment destruct widespread infertil discrimin religi belief blame wile evil loo liber woman men allow becom way given basic world histori much tale ring eerili true pull differ aw moment togeth creat narr slaveri holocaust public execut day civil right combin creat possibl futur must read decad narrat tell stori turn move present past seemingli amaz coexist speak unknown audienc apolog part tale admit imagin get away wish thing cannot cannot return first time ive read tale pull differ thing time rather earlier read feel raw emot inspir analyz time mental track sourc inspir novel woven togeth neatli complet sociologist analysi end could world happen alreadi certain level certain place world that part make ring true compel

During the first 500 pages, this book was on its way to being my favorite of the series. I love that Jamie and Claire are free to start building their life in the Colonies.

29981,849,147,"I'll admit that I had a bit of a jump, being from the place and the culture. Although I didn't grow up in the period, when I was a child, I knew the first and second generations described in this story, and the author has them cold. It's hard to believe that there was a time when working people had so little that a tea cup or a handkerchief could be a prized possession.

The writing is lyrical and lovely, and the characters are rich and vivid. Reviewers who didn't like this book largely complained that the book wandered through various story lines. That's actually part of the beauty of this book--it meanders through and around the lives of the characters and weaves them together. But life is like that. People are like that. We influence each other in subtle and sometimes invisible ways.

I thank the author for bringing back the memory of my mother searching through the bottom of her purse for a quarter to give to the tiny nun who used to sit just inside the front door of A&S's with a tan reed basket on her lap.

29983,4421,121,"Well, here we are. 1500 pages and several months later, and all I have to say is poor Roger.

I do agree with the qualms that not much happens in this book because nothing major really happened. Aside from some major plot-advancing events in the last 500 pages, the majority of this book was filler. But, that is not to say that I didn't enjoy it. As opposed to the previous four books that I finished within a week or two, I took my time with this book and balanced reading it with other books.

As always, I treasured the moments between Claire and Jamie. They are the reason I fell in love with this series in the first place and will ALWAYS be my favorite couple. Moving up in the couples rank are surprisingly Roger and Brianna. I've always disliked Brianna and I still harbored anger and annoyance towards her for most of this book. However, upon reflection, I realized that my hatred of Brianna has lessened slightly. I still find her slightly selfish and annoying but I've come to accept her because she has developed some and Roger loves her. ROGER! He was put through trials and tribulations in this book but it warmed my heart to see him step up for Brianna and his family.

You keep wondering if the innocent person will ever be able to prove her innocence, and if she does, how can she stay alive long enough to accomplish it. One of the best parts is seeing Casey come to a belief in God and how she starts seeing the way He has been with her all along.

29991,4939,2305,"I liked  the story I Am Legend well enough, but it's only the first 170 pages of this book. There are ten short stories after I Am Legend, half of which I gave one or two stars to. I gave the other short stories four or five stars. I Am Legend has been made into at least three movies that I know of. The Omega Man (1971) is my favorite version. The first movie, The Last Man on Earth (1964) had zombies that were too weak and slow moving to be believable and I Am Legend (2007) had zombies that were too strong and fast to be believable. They could crawl on ceilings like bugs, which was so unbelievable I laughed.

I'm always reading some good fantasy or science fiction. This month I'm rereading my favorite five military sci-fi classics: Starship Troopers by Robert A. Heinlein (1959), The Forever War by Joe Haldeman (1974), Armor by John Steakley (1984), Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card (1985), and Old Man's War by John Scalzi (2005).

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010).

Having returned to Slotter Key a hero, Kyla Vatta has survivors from Miksland turning up as escapees on her doorstep, and Ky's suddenly trapped in her house having been declared a non citizen and wanted for questioning. The whereabouts of the other personnel who escaped from Milksland is unknown and alarmingly Aunt Grace is coming under legal and personal attack. Facts surrounding Grace's past are brought to light that threaten her freedom. Stella is forced to dig deep and finds herself more capable than she thought.
At times I found events in Into the Fire somewhat disjointed. Stella's self pitying stance becomes dangerous for all. On the other hand she is being kept in the dark by Ky. Even though we have seen Stella come into her own as a highly talented woman, here we see her face unforeseen danger and grow from that testing.
Ages old mysteries are brought to light and Ky finds the past rushing up to capture the present. Danger looms and the enemy is faceless. Whom to trust is moot as the very fabric of Slotter Key is threatened. Politics and legalities threaten Kyla and Rafe and the plans they'd been making are put on hold as survival becomes prime.

My biggest issues with BURN BRIGHT was the pace and the way that information was just sort of chaotically thrown around. The pace was slow and I had a hard time getting excited when I just wanted things to happen. It left me a bit bored which made it hard to get into when things actually did start happening. Information was thrown out so willy-nilly that it made things a little confusing at times. Thankfully the plot twists and the action helped me get back into the story.

The plot as a whole was interesting. There was a lot of character driven moments and the mystery actually stayed a mystery. There are some things that are revealed about Mercy's past and some things about Bran that were a bit shocking. I am interested to see if this information comes out again in future stories.

Like I said, not my favorite Alpha and Omega installment, but it furthered the series. BURN BRIGHT definitely ends in a way that makes you want more though so here's to hoping that the next book doesn't have these same issues.

Meanwhile, someone is targeting Brans wildings, the werewolves a little too wild and crazy for the regular pack hierarchy, who live in the mountains near Brans land.

In true John Green style, this book was phenomenal. If I was still teaching my Children's Literature course, this book would definitely be on the reading list. Turtles All the Way Down gives the reader an inside view into the OCD mind of the main character, Aza.

As usual, the character development in this novel is outstanding. Aza, the main character, is the focus but the supporting cast of characters including Daisy, Davis, and Aza's mum are equally wonderful. Written in first person, we are witnesses to Aza's ongoing struggles, her despair and truimph.

Green incorporates so much in this little book. The struggles of living with a mental illness. Teens coping with the loss of a parent. A mother's fears of losing her daughter. And a mystery that is solved in the end. And, to top it off, Green also weaves his extreme love of both art and science into this novel. For such a short book, it truly has everything and is wrapped up in a wonderful package.

30012,1968,3560,"[NOTE: I received a copy of this book through Netgalley.]

Kind of a darker retelling of Alice in Wonderland, down to the characters name, but more hinged on fairy tales (the ones with not so happy endings, that is). Alice Crewe has spent her whole life going from one place to the other with her mother Ella, never meeting her famous grandmother, Althea, an author whose book is also impossible to find. When Althea dies, Ella and Alice startto believe they can finally have a normal life, but of course this isn't meant to be, as things keep changing for the worst.

I liked this book, although I didn't love it, possibly because I had a hard time connecting with the characters. I had mixed feelings about the time devoted to them, to be honest: on the one hand, I wanted the Hinterland part of the story to start much sooner, on the other hand, I felt that I also needed more time to get to know Alice and Finch better. Mostly they were all on the surface, and apart from Alices pent-up anger, I didn't feel like there was much personality underneath. (I did like them, just in a sort of indifferent way?)

The fairy tales / nonsensical parts of the book appealed to me more, in spite of similes that made me go huh? more than a few times. I do have a soft spot for that kind of whimsical atmosphere, I guess. And what we see of the Hinterland tales Althea wrote made me think that Id like to read *that* book, and know how its tales actually end.

The plot had its good sides and its downsides. I liked how its Hinterland part dealt with the power of stories, their straps, and the sort of twisted logic that one can find in them; however, I felt like it was a little lacklustre, and dealt with too fast (compared to the part devoted to the real world). There were a few loose threads, toofor instance, the red-haired man showing up at the caf, then disappearing again. (Why did he go away at that specific moment? It was never really explained.)

30019,4940,846,"This was my first taste of the Scandinavian writer, Jo Nesbo - my OCD-like tendencies having caused me to spurn earlier opportunities to read him, in favour of his waiting for his first published book, The Bat to become available at my local library.
 Having collected it Thursday evening, I read a chapter on Friday night, got properly stuck into it on Saturday afternoon and finished it Sunday evening.
First thoughts  better than average, without blowing me away totally. Perhaps most debuts aren't the best work an author can produce and his later books are stronger, although this did win the 1998 Glass Key Award  for best Scandinavian Novel of the year.
Harry Hole  Nesbos Norwegian policeman pitches up in Sydney to assist in the investigation into the violent death of a young Norwegian woman.  After initially only being assigned an observer role in the investigation, Harry and his Aboriginal babysitter, Andrew Kensington are drawn deeper into the pursuit of a serial rapist-killer.
The novel immerses Hole into Sydneys notorious King Cross area, full of seedy bars, strip joints and prostitution. Kensington befriending Harry gives Nesbo the opportunity to provide some background history to the difficulties between the Aboriginal indigents and white-Australia, as well as imparting some knowledge on some Aboriginal cultural beliefs and legends.
Whilst I enjoyed the book in the main, particularly Nesbos ensemble of characters, as well as the violence that seemed never too far away from Hole, I wasn't totally convinced by Harrys subsequent phoenix-like rise from the ashes of his latest alcoholic lapse.
Where Nesbo did score points with me was with his readiness to dispense permanently with key characters during the execution of the investigation.
Im looking forward to more reading more from Nesbo, though cant decide whether to wait for the second Harry Hole instalment when it is published in English later this year  The Cockroach, or skip ahead to The Redbreast ( Hole - number 3), or alternately the standalone book Headhunters.

30024,3838,1527,"This novel immediately throws you into a mysterious kingdom where dark creatures/forces exist, the rule is just as lawless as the roads it reigns over, and the people and its lands struggle to survive.  The story centers around a tavern and the barkeep ('Kote') that owns it, who you come to understand is locally unrecognized yet the ""hero"" he once was is a highly celebrated legend.  His anonymity maintains until a traveling scribe comes upon him and determines to write the legend's story.  So, that is where the series really begins as the barkeep recalls his beginnings and the journey that turned him into the fabled figure he came to be known as but also debunking some of the myths along with it.  The story lives in his past but occasionally flashes back to the present, to reflect and to highlight his struggle to reconcile against who he has now become.

Patrick Rothfuss does well to captivate you with the main character, who I often found myself likening to a Harry Potter-esque protagonist, in that he capitalizes on his strengths and ""games"" his way through his deficiencies to overcome obstacles as well as rebel against unjust institutions. The emphasis of this telling is more about the evolution of the character than just magic and spells, which exist but often remain an aside as the author creates this universe.

My main knock, as others have pointed as well, is that the author often draws out certain plot points and aspects of the main character's development well beyond the point of relevance.  The story is intended to be a gradual build into the present, but even as the pacing picks up the author will just as quickly bog you down with repetition of the same events to hammer in a point already thoroughly made.

30034,67,3468,"If you were driving through Biloxi, Mississippi on August 23rd of 2014, and happened to stop at the Biz-E-Bee store on Reconfort Avenue and Division Street that afternoon just as Tanya Harris walked in, and her brother, Cameron rolled up, you might have been there to witness the Miracle. Not that theyd gone there looking for a miracle, Tanya was looking to buy some cigarettes, and Cameron, melting in the heat and humidity of the day, had beer in mind to offset the weather.

As it was, it was Mrs. Eulalie Dooley who saw the ins and outs of all the days of this town from her front porch through her very own ninety-one-year-old eyes, which is where she was when Tanya left Cameron sitting in his wheelchair as she went into the small convenience store, across the street from her front porch. Tanya, inside the store, wandered a bit, picking up an extra item here or there, but it wasn't even eight minutes she was inside that store, the last shoppers lined up for paying ahead of her had left by then, her obligatory chat with the stores owners lasting mere minutes.

All the while, Cameron is sitting under the awning in his wheelchair, when suddenly he experiences an unwelcome and unexpected bout of nausea. It passes. Then reappears, this weirdly uncomfortable feeling moving through him. And then it passes again.

What followed was a miracle of sorts, no matter how you see it. Cameron, who hadnt walked since he was in Afghanistan four years ago, wasn't even conscious of doing this, as though his body was taking control so that he would see later on what he was capable of doing, despite surgeries and doctors that had told him otherwise for years. He walked.

Now, Mrs. Eulalie Dooley may have seen some things in her ninety-one years of living, but this wasn't just an everyday something, this was something. A miracle. And because she knew she was witnessing a miracle, as this young man whom shed known all the years of his life had risen from his wheelchair and taken small, tentative, shaky steps, and because she also knew it was unlikely shed ever witness another miracle as telling as this, she shouted praises to Heaven above from her front porch.

What follows changes as time passes, and as time moves back and forth through time from Camerons school days, from his days in Afghanistan, and then back to the present as the media gets hold of his story and descends. His VA doctor becomes more involved trying to unravel this medical mystery as to how something medically / scientifically impossible has occurred. The media wants to tell a version of this story, and the media has its followers, who seek out their truth by traveling to this spot where this miracle occurred, which has now added souvenirs as those journeying there needed some token to proclaim that theyd been there. Stood on holy ground. Some arrive seeking a religious experience. Others, like reality television producers, view it as their ticket to a goldmine.

Somewhat reminiscent of Billy Lynns Long Halftime Walk for me, with the focus on those whose physical repercussions forever change the paths of their lives long after their return, there is a witty, satirical twist to this story.

Religions, faith vs. judgment vs. science, are parts of this story, as is how faith is viewed in present-day America, but the heart of this story is love. Parental love, sibling love and the kind of love that your heart recognizes as home.

It was so fascinating and poignant what the authors make you feel and think while reading this book, particularly when it comes to Aidan. It's crazy to think I felt so much for an AI, but it's true.

A couple things to note is that I didn't connect with the main and secondary characters of this book as much as I did with the others. Even though much of this book is about Asha, Rhys, and everyone else on Kerenza, I just didn't feel as deeply for them as I have for the others in previous books. I was honestly craving more of the other two couples, their drama, and also what was going on in the Mao. I think that's also partly why I wasn't as into the book as I wanted to be. Don't get me wrong, it's a pageturner, but not as intense as its predecessors.

That issue aside, I genuinely loved the book. You are in for such a good time when you read one of these books and this last one is no different. This is one of those instances where the book/series stays with you, long after you've finished reading it and one that I immediately want to dive back into even though I had just finished it. Also, if there's one series you want in both physical and audio formats, it is this one. Both versions are true masterpieces.

The illustrations were seriously on point as well and I would totally be down for a graphic novel from K&K and Marie Lu.

30038,2418,1008,"Imagine a short time into the future, where the world is so broken that when people have the choice, they would rather inhabit a simulated reality, go to work in a virtual office, learn at a virtual school, and in their free time play in the largest online game ever created. OASIS, created by James Halliday, permits this global networking. When Halliday died, he had already programmed a devilishly clever, incredibly hard quest line into his game, with a winner-take-all prize of $240 billion dollars to the first player to solve it.

Wade Watts is a daily player of the game, and he understand that Hallidays passion with the 1980s will play a major part in solving the quest. The author has injected his book with a cornucopia of knowledge of that era, and the more a gamer like Wade knows about the films, movies, TV shows, books, music, games, and everything else connected with those years, the better his or her chances of winning will be. The story builds with each chapter, keeping your interest as the tension ratchets higher and higher until the final outcome.

This could have been just another book, but author Ernest Cline allows us to become part of the world. In doing so, all the various knowledge of that decade becomes incredibly interesting as we follow Wade in his struggle to complete the quest of all quests. This is a YA book, not my usual choice of genres, but if you like YA or are a fan of the 1980s, or if you just like to enjoy a great story, this is the book to read. Although the Spielberg-directed movie will be released in late March of 2018  and I am sure it will be fantastic  it will be impossible to cram all the elements of the book into a movie. If you have any desire to see the movie, I strongly suggest you read the book first. Cline will not disappoint.

30048,693,3750,"Climate change. The threat of thermonuclear war. Bioterrorism. Overpopulation. Is it any wonder that most Americans today are pessimistic about the future of the human race? In the face of all these (and so many other) existential threats to the survival of our civilization, who can blame us for wondering whether our grandchildren will live to see the 22nd century? Yet there are those who sail against the prevailing currents of thought and see a future that is endlessly bright. To this brave cadre of optimists we can now add physicist Michio Kaku, who peers hundreds of thousands of years into the future, envisioning human civilization spread throughout the galaxy in his dazzling new book, The Future of Humanity. Read this book, and he will take you on a journey from the moon and Mars to the multiverse.

Either we must leave the Earth or we will perish.
Professor Kakus prescription is unambiguous: Either we must leave the Earth or we will perish. There is no other way. In this judgment, he has a lot of company. The late Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, for example, not to mention many other prominent scientists and technologists (and a handful of politicians) who see humanitys future in the stars. Yet none of these individuals view the future through the rose-colored glasses of faith alone or science fantasy. Their conviction is grounded in solid scientific research. Kaku makes that overwhelmingly clear in his considered, step-by-step presentation of the steady progression of the human race, first back to the moon, Mars, and the asteroids; then to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn; and finally onward to the nearest stars, with stopovers on the comets that swarm by the millions in the vast Oort Cloud that surrounds the solar system. This is truly a journey from the moon and Mars to the multiverse.

From the moon and Mars to the multiverse
The Future of Humanity is divided into four parts. In the first, Kaku takes us along to witness the establishment of a permanent base on the moon and the settlement and terraforming of Mars. In part two, we accompany him as humanity moves beyond the solar system to explore the nearby stars. Part three concerns the settlement of extrasolar planets, dwelling on the genetic changes that will be required for humans to adapt to the daunting conditions so likely to be found there.

The authors argument is easy to follow throughout most of his book. His explanations of scientific phenomena are remarkably clear, using an abundance of pithy similes and metaphors. Only in the final chapters when he attempts to explain string theory (his specialization) and the more fanciful imaginings of cosmologists does Professor Kakus language become opaque. String theory contains an infinite number of parallel universes, called the multiverse, each one as valid as the next. In ten dimensions.

Ideas from the greats of science fiction
Science fiction fans will encounter a wealth of familiar concepts, from the most mundane (mining the asteroids) to the most spectacular (uploading human consciousness and projecting it with lasers or gravity beams throughout the galaxy). In fact, Kaku makes frequent references to the work of such science fiction luminaries as Olaf Stapledon, Isaac Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke. Yet, in this book alone, the author floats enough fascinating ideas to put a whole roomful of science fiction writers to shame. And there is no doubting his optimism: Transhumanism, instead of being a branch of science fiction or a fringe movement, may become an essential part of our very existence.

30049,3908,224,"This book is so much more than I expected!! Interested in learning more about serial killer H.H.Holmes and his murderous ways in Chicago in the late 1800's, I was pleasantly surprised that this book is more about the 1893 World's Fair than about the serial killer. I found myself enjoying the history of the planning, building and showmanship of the World's Fair even more than the horrific facts about Holmes' activities. From the AC power provided by Nikola Tesla that lit up the entire grounds to the huge wheel designed by George Ferris, the World's Fair was a wondrous spectacle that brought hundreds of thousands of people into the city. An unintended result was that the Fair also brought many young women new to the city and unchaperoned for the first time....some of whom fell victim to the charms and murderous intent of H.H. Holmes.

I listened to the audio version of this book. The audiobook is just over 15 hours long and narrated by Scott Brick. I like Brick's voice, and he read at a nice even pace. I have hearing loss, but had no problem hearing and understanding the audio. Larson obviously did copious amounts of research into the planning, construction and details of the World's Fair. He gives so much detail about all aspects of the event, and of H.H.Holmes' life, crimes, capture and subsequent prosecution and execution. Great story!

Note of caution: This book is Non-fiction, and not written like a narrative story. There are lots of facts and information about the Fair, its planning and engineering, the events, people, etc.....plus copious details about H.H. Holmes. This does not read like a fictional novel or story! Readers who don't enjoy historical accounts with lots and lots of details...this might not be the book for you. History buffs or those who love great details like how many people could ride the first Ferris wheel at one time or how many people attended the Fair each day, etc....will LOVE this!! I sure did!

30064,1613,1843,"""Mankind has a responsibility to the Sea.""

I loved this book! It is a little bit of everything. I loved that it was intelligent, well researched, fascinating, entertaining and had me at the edge of my seat. This was a real page turner for me combining horror and mystery with science. A book about Mermaids you say? I say it is a book about greed, the quest for knowledge, a quest for answers, sea life, scientific exploration and of course, mermaids. This book is also about what happens when what you go searching for, finds you. What happens when your need for answers clouds your judgement? What happens when the worse happens and you are on a boat in the middle of the Ocean?

""Nothing is worth the risk of being lost.""

Seven years ago, the Atargatis, set off to film a mockumentary off the Marina Trench. No one survived that voyage. Footage was found that showed a horrible slaughter on board. The footage was written off as a hoax. But there are those who thought the footage was real. There were surviving friends and family members who wanted answers. There were those who saw this as an answer to his/her life's work. There were those who saw this as the opportunity of a lifetime to do research, to hunt and to find answers. They know the risk and they are all happy to undertake it. This will make them famous. They will be the ones who can validate if mermaids really do exist, or they will be the ones to dispel the myth. They see this voyage as a win-win situation.

Thus, a new ship sets off for the Marina Trench. Full of scientists, doctors, hunters, dolphins, the latest technology and a journalist to record it all. These people have seen the footage. Some believe the footage to be real, some believe it is fake, others go believing they will not survive the scientific exploration. There are a lot of crew members and scientists on this ship (cruise ship). I will not describe the individual people except to say that one character, Victoria Stewart, a marine biologist, lost her sister on the Atargatis so hers is the most personal story, but is still one of many. Another positive of this book is that although the book has a lot of characters, it was not distracting in the least bit. This book is so wonderfully written and thought out that having a huge case of characters is not confusing at all. It is easy to keep track of them as they all have distinct personalities. You will never confuse one character for another - even in the case of twins, YAY! Speaking of the characters, they were all believable. Some are instantly like-able, some seem a little aloof, some had ulterior motives, etc. These characters had flaws and felt very real.

""It was beautiful, in its own terrible way. So many monsters are.""

Once the ship gets to the Marina Trench, the Mermaids make their appearance. Yes, readers, characters you find like able will meet their demise. The Sea can be a cruel place and mermaids are NOT Ariel from the Little Mermaid. They are intelligent, brutal, violent, crafty and dangerous. The crew and scientists quickly learn that they are dealing with creatures who have adapted so well over time that they can survive in the sea and on the boat for periods at a time. The scientist believe they are on the safest boat, it was designed to keep them safe, it is technologically advanced and built to withstand almost anything - ALMOST anything.

I was not expecting to LOVE this book as much as I did. This book is so wonderfully written and there are sections that are told from various points of view. We see the POV of a dolphin, a mermaid, and several characters. This was done brilliantly! I honestly think this was one of the smartest horror books I have ever read. The scientific terms, the medical terms, etc. never weigh down the story or make it hard to understand. I think they actually enhance the story. I don't think I have ever said that before. I think it is a rare gift to be able to make, say, marine biology make sense to a non-scientist.

Plus, this book is pretty much non stop suspense. I was actually nervous while reading this in parts. Who will live? Who will die? Don't forget they are on a boat in the middle of the ocean, who will save them? Can they be saved? Will they save themselves? What happens when you walk into a lions den - or in this case explore a mermaid's trench? Well, what did you think was going to happen?

""And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee."" -Nietzsche

This book is beautifully written, clever, creative, suspenseful, thought provoking, creepy, eerie and at times horrific. The storytelling is riveting. I literally could not put this book down. This book does not disappoint. As the ""pages"" turned this book got better. The story built and there were so many characters to like and root for. Knowing that they all can't survive adds to the suspense and drama of the book. Grant also has very vivid descriptions in this book, I could imagine what the mermaids looked like, I had images in my mind for all of the characters.

Not a fan of horror? Take a chance on this book! It's intelligent, entertaining and so damn good! A book about mermaids? One might say, ""eh, not for me"" well, think again! I LOVE when a book can knock my socks off. This one did it. It's a heart pounding voyage that I am glad I took while sitting safely in my chair.

I highly recommend this book!!!

30067,3345,985,"Trust me, Im still shocked about this rating and reaction I had to My Sisters Keeper, especially since Ive read and enjoyed several of Jodi Picoults other novels in the past. I fully expected to add this title to that list, but unfortunately it didn't turn out to be the reading experience I was hoping for. Im not saying the writing is bad, which would be a lie since it is just as strong as ever and of a quality Ive become to expect of her work. And without doubt the plot is complex and well developed with many different POVs and angles to try and get a full picture of what is going on. BUT. What ruined this story for me and basically turned me into a giant red angry monster spitting out flames and throwing things at the wall (no actual objects were harmed during this read), was the topic and more especifically the views on that topic. As soon as I got a glimpse of what really was going on, I started to get very angry very fast. Honestly, I don't think I would have ever read it if I would have known My Sisters Keeper was centered around these views. Complicated and uncomfortable moral topic and unorthodox views? Maybe, but I couldn't care less if they were represented right because I was just too angry to pay attention. People might be offended by this, but Im totally on Annas side here. She should NOT be treated as a walking human donor bank and just being pressured to give up everything and go through all those treatments just because her parents say so It should be her choice and her choice alone. And honestly, the whole reason they had her in the first place made me sick. This book and especially Sara were so SO infuriating! Her with her saying she cares for Anna, but only thinks of Kate and having Anna as a spare ready to give up whatever part of her body they need next. And Im not even talking about their older brother, completely ignored as well. I get that having a child with leukemia is horrible and kind of makes you forget about anything else, but still Its no excuse to treat your other kids that way, and definitely not to do those things to Anna, treating her like shes some object and ignoring her when shes not needed. Ugh. Im feeling the anger rise again just as I type up this review Simply disgusting. These strong negative feelings made it impossible for me to try and enjoy the other aspects and side stories of My Sisters Keeper, which had potential on its own but lost its charm since I was seeing everything through a red haze. Oh yes, this book was able to provoke strong feelings, just not the positive ones I was expecting.

This is a King classic with one of the most well known horror bad guys, Pennywise the dancing clown.  As it turns out, 2 decades erases a lot of memory of details so it was like reading it for the first time!  It is an endearing story about a group of friends that form a bond one summer and learn how friendship, hope, and love can defeat the worst evil most anyone has ever experienced.

I can see why so many people thought this was very emotional, as it was.  I think since I work with victims of child abuse and domestic violence the emotional aspect of this book was lost on me.  I do think this was a great look into domestic violence and the reality of why it takes victims several attempts before or if ever leaving their situation.
It was very emotional seeing the relationship between a daughter and her mother.  This part definitely hit my emotions more!  I still ended up shedding tears in this one which Kristin Hannah is very well known for.  OK!  A lot of tears!

It starts off talking about ""Collectors collect things...some people people collect stamps, some people collect coins, others collect rocks. Some collect art, some collect books, others collect baseball cards, some people collect comic books. AND JEROME? What did he collect? ... WORDS.""

Jerome collects words he hears and sees and reads. Children are introduced to lots of different kinds of words. Plus 'powerful' words -- like ""I understand."" ""I'm sorry."" ""You matter."" Jerome collects lots of words!

We do a 'word of the day' so this book fits right into our little word study. Jerome collects his words in a box and we have also started to do this. Our word of the day is posted in magnetic letters on the refrigerator. My grandson then writes it on a piece of paper and puts it in his word box.  My grandson has Mosaic Down Syndrome and is slightly autistic. This book appeals to his since of order and helps him learn definitions, word use and spelling.

The Muslim boy was my favorite character. He was the only character that was approachable, genuine and had good intentions. The whole story takes place over approximately one day, so it was slow moving. It requires a lot of descriptions to cover such a short time span, which the author does pretty well.

30075,1373,1139,"I read The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian to fulfill the prompt of A book about or involving a sport (basketball, in this case) for the 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge. The book had been lingering on my TBR for the past 3 years, and this seemed like a good time to finally get into it.

This semi-autobigraphical YA novel follows the adventures of Arnold Spirit, AKA Junior. Junior is a Spokane Indian who lives on the reservation. Born with hydrocephalus, Junior is a 14-year-old boy who dreams of being a cartoonist, and uses cartoons to deal with his feelings regarding his dysfunctional family, poverty, community, and the world at large.

Arnolds life changes when he decides he wants to leave the reservation and attend a different school, where the only other Indian is the school mascot.

This book is fairly short, but touches on a lot of topics such as poverty, race relations, alcoholism, enforced governmental segregation, and how one person seeking to better themselves can feel like a betrayal to others in a tight-knit community. It manages to make its points without being preachy, and while maintaining a sense of humor even while navigating losses and tragedies.

The book does dip into (what I would consider typical) 14-year-old boy issues, such as masturbatory skills and the sometimes awkward timing of erections, but isn't unnecessarily explicit.

30081,630,578,"Turtle Alveston is a survivor. At fourteen, she roams the woods along the northern California coast. The creeks, tide pools, and rocky islands are her haunts and her hiding grounds, and she is known to wander for miles. But while her physical world is expansive, her personal one is small and treacherous: Turtle has grown up isolated since the death of her mother, in the thrall of her tortured and charismatic father, Martin. Her social existence is confined to the middle school (where she fends off the interest of anyone, student or teacher, who might penetrate her shell) and to her life with her father.

  Then Turtle meets Jacob, a high-school boy who tells jokes, lives in a big clean house, and looks at Turtle as if she is the sunrise. And for the first time, the larger world begins to come into focus: her life with Martin is neither safe nor sustainable. Motivated by her first experience with real friendship and a teenage crush, Turtle starts to imagine escape, using the very survival skills her father devoted himself to teaching her. What follows is a harrowing story of bravery and redemption. With Turtles escalating acts of physical and emotional courage, the reader watches, heart in throat, as this teenage girl struggles to become her own heroand in the process, becomes ours as well.

My Thoughts: As I turned the pages of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Absolute-Darling-A-Novel/dp/B01N1U8J3T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Absolute Darling: A Novel</a>, I felt a sense of urgency, of hope for this young girl to escape a violent life. Nothing good could come of her life with the father who regularly abuses her and creates in her a perspective that shuns all that is good in the world.

How can she keep staying with him? Why does she not even try to escape when small connections with others show her an alternative to what she experiences with him?

Perhaps it is the years I spent saving children from abuse and neglect that kept me turning pages, longing to protect this girl.

But despite these concerns and the longing to see the character take another path, I found myself discouraged and frustrated. Parts of the story revealed the tedious details of living off the grid, and how Turtle continued to give in the demands of her father.

But then something happened that turned the tide, and Turtle suddenly and intensely fought for her life and the lives of others. Those pages saved the book for me, earning three stars; I could not give more due to the darkness of a book littered with violence and excessive verbal abuse.

and so, you read on.  maybe you haven't read wolfe or irving or any of the other authors who wrote in the literary genre or seen the movies, the graduate, harold and maude; or maybe you're an ardent fan of barnes; or you're a student of subtleties, of a word here and there evocative of some larger theme even if that theme is not present in this book, something that reveals barnes as a nuanced writer.  you read on, hoping for some moment in the story that will grab your attention.  and after one hundred pages, when you're in the second of the three parts, and the confessional voice of the innocent switched to the second person, of the you that most distanced of narrators, the story gains weight, the innocent becomes guilty and experienced, the story becomes sad, the tragic observation of the downward spiraling of an alcoholic and of the one who stays.

30086,530,3883,"I enjoyed this book, even though it's not the type of story I usually go for. It's a YA novel that can be enjoyed by adults as well.

The story revolves around three main characters -- 19-year-old Elias, trusted friend of Del Mar's new young king, Ulises, and Mercedes, the king's cousin and friend/love interest of Elias. In the prologue, which takes place 18 years before the present day, Ulises' two older brothers, including the heir to the throne, and their retinue are attacked at a picnic by an unidentified band of warriors from another nation. The brothers and Elias' father are taken away; the rest of the party is killed. No one knows what became of the king's brothers and Elias' father, but rumor has it that they drowned in the sea when their boat sank.

Now, Elias is a gifted mapmaker, just like his father was. Ulises is learning to be a king, and Mercedes is a trained fighter who keeps an eye on her cousin's safety. Then, two of Elias' father's maps turn up in Del Mar, with structures drawn on them that didn't exist until a few years ago. And there's a riddle -- to solve a mystery, look for things that AREN'T on the map. Could Elias' father and the king's brothers still be alive somewhere?

The trio of friends takes up the quest, putting themselves and those around them in danger. There's treachery at the palace, but who is behind it? Who is determined to keep them from learning the maps' secrets?

I found the characters  engaging, and the story moved along quickly enough to keep my attention. I don't know if there will be a sequel, but based on the way this story ends, there could be.

Still Me is chick lit at its best, poignant, bittersweet, and funny.  It is hard not to like Louisa Clark.

Louisa Clark is trying to follow Will Traynors advice to live boldly by moving to New York City to take a job as socialite Agnes Gopniks personal assistant. She is confident that she and her boyfriend Sam can maintain a long distance relationship, but she is quickly caught up in her new life, a far cry from the quiet life she left in England. As expected, things do not go exactly as planned, and Louisa finds herself betrayed by those she trusts the most. Facing hard times, she turns to golden boy Josh, who bears a striking resemblance to Will, and attempts to carry on. Enter new friends and the Gopniks neighbor Mrs. De Witt, and Louisa finds the courage to try more new things and be true to herself.

I admit it, this is the first book by Jojo Moyes that I have read, but I did see the film adaptation to Me Before You so I was familiar with the characters and backstory before I started reading. Chick lit is not always my favorite genre, but I greatly enjoy Moyes writing style and the characters.  Louisa is almost too good at heart, and I hated to see her taken advantage of. What a reward for being loyal!  Of course, readers will see whats coming from a mile away; I know I did, but it is inspirational to watch Louisa bounce back, even if some luck is involved. Mrs. De Witt and her dog Dean Martin are a high point for me. I just adore her crusty exterior. Since I have not read the other books in the trilogy, I did not know Sam well enough to trust him, and Josh was a disappointment. My biggest problem with all of the characters, except Louisa, is that no one is able to express themselves which leads to lies, miscommunication, assumptions, and drama. I admire Louisas gumption and willingness to persevere, to be true to herself. There is a lesson for all of us here.

I greatly enjoyed my time with Louisa and will definitely go back and read the other books in the trilogy.

This book had all the elements that I would want in a novel and no cliffhanger that is so common in the Fever series. This one wraps up the story arc for Dani but it also leaves a lot of unanswered questions that I would like to see acknowledged in another book.

30092,1840,187,"I saw this was coming out as a movie though it was from a book. So, of course, the reader in me was like girl you better just read the book before you watch this movie. I am so very glad I did.

I didn't cry until I got towards the end with the awards, to me that was everything. It wasn't sadness I cried but joy because Auggie is a remarkable child one that he knows the world is mean but tries not to let it bother him though it does.

We get different chapters from August, Olivia, Jack, Miranda, Summer, and Justin. Though Justin's part in the book bothered me because of the grammar. Words were not capital and the grammar was not there.

Though out the book I loved the strength and courage that August had. Even when people said mean things or whispered about him he still showed courage to ignore them, even though I know it hurts. I really loved Mr. Browne's precepts that he writes on the board every month. Each one has a deep meaning, but the one that gets me and sticks out is September's. ""When given the choice between being right or being kind, choose kind."" -Dr. Wayne W. Dyer this speaks volumes with just a few words.

Within this story, we see how August's family handles how he believes himself to be different even though he is just a normal child. They love him unconditionally and he forms friendships because he is simply an amazing, funny 5th grader.

Honestly, I am not sure how to write this review without giving anything away. The book was simply amazing it left me feeling raw, emotional, happy. I could feel through the words how strong of a person Auggie was! Not a lot of people are as strong or courageous as he is in the real world.

30096,35,2811,"The Girl You Left Behind is a very sweet story.  Like all of JoJo Moyes' books, I enjoyed every page and devoured it in a very short period of time. Having said that, I think some of her other works are more compelling.

There are two parts to The Girl You Left Behind--the story about Sophie, a woman running a bar/hotel, in small-town France, during World War I; and the story about Liv, a widow struggling to survive following the unexpected death of her husband, in current time.  What unites these two woman who are living 100 years apart?  Liv is now the proud owner of a painting made in Sophie's likeness, which was painted by Sophie's husband, a Matisse-inspired artist.

The problem?  The two stories don't really mesh.  It's truly like reading two different novels.  Beyond that, there are several little piddly things that really bothered me.  For example, a big deal is made about a baby pig during Sophie's section of the book.  They hide it from the German soldiers so it will grow and provide sustenance for them and their neighbors. The problem?  Where in the world are they getting the food to feed this pig?  These people are surviving on some atrocity called black bread, a food which likely tasted as atrocious as it sounded.  There were no leftovers.  And it's not as if the pig could roam free, finding truffles in the yard.  It had to be hidden from the Germans.

That's one of many minor oversights I found in this book.  Am I being picky?  Perhaps.  But if an author chooses to write historical fiction, accuracy equals success.  Anything less isn't acceptable to readers.

Overall, if you've enjoyed Moyes' previous books, you'll enjoy this one as well.  It's worth reading.

When Virginia Troy was a young girl she lived with her mother inside of a cult.  One day there is a fire at the compound and Virginias mother dies in the fire. By some miracle, Virginia and the other children in the cult survive, at least physically.  Emotionally it is a different story. Those children are scarred for life. With a lot of love and support from her grandma and a lot of therapy, Virginia is now an art gallery owner and she is coping pretty well. When one of her artist friends dies, the result of an apparent suicide, Virginia does not believe that is the cause of death. Before they died, they sent Virginia a picture that she drew depicting that fateful night.  She believes her friend has been murdered by the cult leader. She decides she needs to hire a private investigator to check out the death.

Cabot Sutter is another one of the children that survived the cult.  He too has had to overcome a lot of emotional scars and he has done that pretty well.  He has become a private investigator and at least on the outside he seems to be doing okay.  He is the investigator that Virginia has hired to find out about her friend. He is the perfect man for the job because he has a personal stake in it.  If anyone can help her find the truth, Virginia feels that Cabot is that man.

Both Virginia and Cabot have a lot of baggage that they carry with them.  Both of them have trouble with relationships. They are both too intense and guarded for any lasting connection.  They both view life differently than others do. But maybe with time and patience, they could be good together. They are very good as partners in solving the mysterious death.  They are great putting together the pieces of the puzzle and handling everything that comes their way. Maybe there is hope that they can find their happily ever after with each other.

The author is very talented in her descriptive writing and throughout much of the book I felt like I was right there watching all of the action taking place.  And there was plenty of action contained within the pages. She is also very talented in creating suspense with just the written word. I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen next but I was afraid to keep reading because of what might happen next.  That is a great predicament to be in.

I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well crafted mystery suspense.  I have read other books by this author and I have enjoyed them all.

30105,1233,3692,"The Queen of Hearts is about two best friends, Zadie and Emma, who have known each other since their twenties. They have experienced everything today from being their for each other during heartbreaks to the stressful intensity of medical school. Zadie is a pediatric cardiologist and Emma is a trauma surgeon. And although they may seem like they have it all - an old secret is about to come out after the return of someone from their past.

At first my fear was that the medical jargon was going to be too much for me. I am a fan of Grey's Anatomy but this was a bit more than that and their were times I felt slightly lost. This did not have any bearing on my judgement of the book though because I felt challenged, which I vastly enjoyed.

Church is a compelling story of a young woman, Lily Decker, who is emotionally damaged after a tragic car accident kills her parents and sister when she is only 8 years old and who is subsequently psychologically and sexually abused by the aunt and uncle that take her in after the accident.  As soon as she graduates from high school, Lily flees to Las Vegas, changes her name to Ruby Wilde and eventually becomes a well-known and highly sought-after showgirl.  Sadly, she learns the hard way that all the glitz, glamour and material wealth she acquires do not erase the scars of her traumatic past.  The portrayal of the Las Vegas scene in the 1960s and 1970s was very interesting, but there are very graphic descriptions of the sexual abuse Lily suffers at the hands of her uncle and a later boyfriend that I found very difficult to read. Despite showing the outright exploitation and manipulation of women during these times, the reader also sees the power of friendship, determination and resiliency in the books female characters.

The last part of the book delivers such a powerful, unexpected and wholly formidable if not astounding ending that I felt it in my gut. Holy cow! Author Alice McDermott has done it again.

The book tells the story of life inside a convent of the Little Nursing Sisters of the Sick Poor. The good nuns take to the streets every day to care for the sick and poverty-stricken. Annie, a young, pregnant widow, whose husband has committed the grave sin of suicide, is taken in by the nuns. She soon delivers a baby girl, named Sally, and the two spend their days in the convent laundry. Years pass, and Annie then does something in secret that nearly causes their world to fall apart when she is discovered. And then Sally, who has lived such a cloistered life, tries to rectify the sin to save her mother's immortal soul.

The resulting explosion was the most powerful manmade explosion on a human population excepting Nagasaki and Hiroshima, a force of 2.9 kilotons of TNT. Over 3,000 people lost their lives, and many more were wounded. Huge swathes of the city were flattened, reduced to rubble and burying survivors beneath the destruction.
Mr. Bacon's wonderful book was recommended to me by my two sisters and my brother-in-law (his grandfather Ernest Barss is one of the people mentioned in the book). It is an amazing story of resilience and courage as well as the willingness of many to help the survivors. Boston, Massachusetts sent trains and boats filled with supplies and personnel to help; as a result, Halifax has every year since sent a Christmas tree to be erected in that city.
A blizzard came in the day after the explosion and just made it even harder for the survivors and those trying to help them. It was a truly astounding event and I'm surprised how little I knew about it. The book mentions how cruise boats today will visit the cemetery where Titanic victims are buried, but nothing is told to them about the Halifax Explosion. That was certainly my experience several years ago when I visited that lovely city. But I guess this book gives me a reason to go back and visit with new eyes.
The author has a very comfortable writing style with a good eye for the small details that enhance the story. His narrative doesn't take away from the horror of the event but also addresses the acts of courage that took place.  This is probably best exemplified by this quote from the book:
""Tragedy comes quick and loud, while the small acts of decency that follow come slowly and quietly.""",1521072000,5,decemb 6 1917 two ship belgian suppli ship montblanc norwegian ship imo collid harbor halifax nova scotia result explos power manmad explos human popul except nagasaki hiroshima forc 29 kiloton tnt 3000 peopl lost live mani wound huge swath citi flatten reduc rubbl buri survivor beneath destruct mr bacon wonder book recommend two sister brotherinlaw grandfath ernest bars one peopl mention book amaz stori resili courag well willing mani help survivor boston massachusett sent train boat fill suppli personnel help result halifax everi year sinc sent christma tree erect citi blizzard came day explos made even harder survivor tri help truli astound event im surpris littl knew book mention cruis boat today visit cemeteri titan victim buri noth told halifax explos certainli experi sever year ago visit love citi guess book give reason go back visit new eye author comfort write style good eye small detail enhanc stori narr doesnt take away horror event also address act courag took place probabl best exemplifi quot

30139,855,3794,"Fun, funny and surprisingly layered with depth the story focuses on Naledi (Ledi) a grad student in epidemiology, and her single-minded determination to succeed in school, support herself and lock down her summer internship all by herself.  For alone is how she thinks it needs to be: promises from others lead to expectations, and a childhood spent in state care and too many foster homes to count have given her plenty of history on which to base that decision.  Strangely enough, the one person she considers her best friend is her polar opposite: rich, unfocused, rather careless with her words and life, and while shes always sorry after the fact, her behavior often makes her a friend that Ledi finds exhausting.

Thabaso, with his personal assistant Likotsi are in New York for a series of events, and his determination to meet Ledi and convince her of her history and her connection to him. Hes headstrong, occasionally tone deaf to the wishes of those around him, the only child of the King and Queen and a real determination to do the best or his country, all while being touted in the tabloids and feeling as if no one wants to know him, once they know hes the prince.  He devises a way (with plenty of cash and an unenthusiastic Likotsi) to infiltrate Ledis life and the two begin a tentative friendship.

From a gala to the lab, a chance to investigate and solve a mysterious illness that could claim the lives of her grandparents, a more than bitchy Queen whose husband finds Ledis responses and spunkiness amusing and a villain causing the illness that is not difficult to discover, Ledi finds herself with family, history and a new friend who finds Thabasos princely moments just as annoying in his assistant Likotsi. Clever and quick reading, the story holds plenty of emotion, heart and heat to please many with the romance and Thabasos determination to see Ledi cared for and happy no matter what.

30146,1730,844,"Alice Feeney has written a fascinating novel-and I was surprised it was her first. SOMETIMES I LIE does not read like a rookie effort, but rather more like an experienced and skilled storyteller. The story, which continually moves around in time,  is convoluted and often surprising, and ultimately has twists and turns the reader will never see coming. There are enough damaged and psychologically unbalanced characters to go around, and each is deeply drawn.

Amber is married, she has a sister with whom she has a stormy relationship, and sometimes she lies. She climbs out of a coma only to find herself in a hospital, unable to move, or speak, or communicate. What happened? As she listens to those who talk around her, and explores her own memory, she begins to believe that her condition was no accident. Someone tried to kill her. Her husband? Her sister? Her ex?

The story alternates between her present situation, the week (Christmas week) before her injury, and her childhood. As the time shifts and the characters evolve, the reader will need to pay agnation, keep up, and try to sort through who is who, what is what, and who is lying.

30148,950,844,"Amber wakes up in the hospital in a coma after an accident, which she cannot remember. She is paralyzed, unable to move or speak. She feels convinced that her husband, Paul, may have had something to do with it. Her visitors include Paul and her sister, Claire.

Well, this is an interesting one. The novel takes the unreliable narrator trope to the highest level. After all, Amber is in a coma, with memory issues. She also tells us, at the beginning of the novel, that she lies. Armed with this information, we are thrown headfirst into the story, trying to figure out exactly what has happened. The reader struggles along with Amber to learn what happened as she overhears snippets in her hotel room. It's quite the ride.

The novel is told in three parts: Amber's thoughts as she struggles to remember from within the coma, Amber telling events as they lead up to the accident, and snippets of childhood journal entries. The result is a confusing, suspenseful read that makes you instantly suspicious about everything and everyone. The novel is full of warning signs and creepy moments. It also features its share of impressive twists and turns. I was definitely shocked a couple of times.

I was, honestly, a little confused sometimes too. I have some weird feelings on this one. It's a great thriller. It keeps you guessing, and it surprises you. A lot, if you're me. I'm not sure I always enjoyed it, but I'm certainly impressed by it, if that makes any sense. No more details, as I highly recommend going in spoiler-free.

Overall I did like the story. It's a fun read, but it's very obviously middle grade. I don't usually read any MG so I had to adapt a bit there. I know that had I read it years and years ago, childhood me would have loved a novel like this. Adult me? Well, I liked it but that's about it.

However, I can definitely see how the movie adaption can be amazing. This story has so much potential for that and I hope - fingers crossed - that it's going to be as brilliant as I'm expecting it to be. Even though the book wasn't exactly my style, I'm hoping that the movie will be!

30158,2359,3783,"The Rescue by Jim Cymbalta is a little book of 7 personal stories of 7 different people sharing their story of Jesus stepping in and turning their life from one of despair to one of hope.  These people all were at the end of their rope.  Lawrence had made is as a college athletic star and flight instructor but he was already into that downward spiral.  To the world it appeared he had it all, all that money could buy that is.  But on his back he carried that knowledge that no one had loved him for just being him--including his mother and father.  No matter how much he achieved there was no one in the stands cheering for him just for being him.  There was no one who loved him until he discovered that Jesus was there all along.  Jesus was there when a homeless Lawrence lay beneath the window on a dirty mattress listening to the pastor talk on someone else's TV telling Lawrence that Jesus loved him and not only that but He had died for him.  That night Lawrence went from the unloved often beaten little boy to an important person who was loved by Jesus.  And that is just the first story read this little book clear through until you get to the little girl who grew up raped over and over by her uncle and later after a childhood of feeling unloved finally found the love of Jesus.  Jesus who could wipe away the tears and understand what little Toni was feeling when at 15 years old she birthed her first baby-- 9 pound little Ruben.  Jesus helped her see that she was worth the love of her husband and her 3 children and clean up her act and become the wife and mother that only Jesus and her loving husband believed her to be.

This book should be on everyone's must read book.  It will make you so feel so good to know that God is on your side through all your troubles and if you just pray He will listen.  Even if you can't say the words He will hear you and love you.  He is that light shining into your dark interior.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001).

The story itself is very confusing at times and I find it hard to believe that children could possibly understand a lot of it. It is fun and whimsical which might be what children enjoy, but I think that for much of it they will be lost.
I also never realized how horrible all of the animals and people in Wonderland were to Alice. Even the Mad Hatter seemed rude and impolite. I think that my outlook on the entire story has changed and in some ways I wish that it hadn't. Wonderland is a place of contradictions, I mean the name even suggests that it is a wonderful place, but in all honesty it was a messy place filled with creatures who were quite horrible and unlikable.
Overall, it was not a bad story, just not one that I would probably read to children.

30187,4939,1088,"This book has six stories by Douglas Adams. I understand Adam's work is not for everyone. The situations are often absurd, surreal. And that's why I love the stories. To find out if Adams is your cup of tea I think every sci-fi fan should at least read the original source material, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. If you love it like I did you will want to read his other stories.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001).

30194,3876,131,"I came cold to this book, knowing nothing of the Osage Nation, their headrights and the wealth those conveyed, their history of displacement,or the 'Reign of Terror' their community endured. Killers of the Flower Moon is a revelation, the book a non-fiction gem. It recounts a shameful chapter of early 20th century American history, telling a tale of astounding cruelty, racism, and betrayal.

After the Osage were driven from Kansas to a godforsaken corner of Oklahoma, it was discovered that their reservation sat upon a huge oil reserve and, in an astonishing twist of fate, theirs became the wealthiest per capita community in the world. This did not sit well with white folks in the region, many of whom were corrupt and determined to eliminate Osage individuals who stood in the way of what they perceived as their own birthright of superiority and wealth. What ensued was a conspirational killing spree that destroyed many Osage families and terrorized members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma for years. The case led to the birth of the FBI as we know it. Grann effectively and engagingly brings this aspect of the story to life by focusing on a particular lawman, Tom White, a solid and heroic figure who ultimately cracked the case of the Osage murders.

Toward the end of the book, the author brings us up-to-date by introducing descendants of the original victims, sharing their stories and helping them seek the truth about the fates that befell their family members 100 years ago and haunt their families to this day.",1521158400,5,came cold book know noth osag nation headright wealth convey histori displacementor reign terror commun endur killer flower moon revel book nonfict gem recount shame chapter earli 20th centuri american histori tell tale astound cruelti racism betray osag driven kansa godforsaken corner oklahoma discov reserv sat upon huge oil reserv astonish twist fate becam wealthiest per caput commun world sit well white folk region mani corrupt determin elimin osag individu stood way perceiv birthright superior wealth ensu conspir kill spree destroy mani osag famili terror member osag nation oklahoma year case led birth fbi know grann effect engagingli bring aspect stori life focus particular lawman tom white solid heroic figur ultim crack case osag murder toward end book author bring u uptod introduc descend origin victim share stori help seek truth fate befel famili member 100 year ago haunt famili day

This book was just one of those books that I couldn't put down until I figured out who was behind it. I kept reading each chapter blaming each character, ""she did it because she's sad"" ""he did it because the boy he didn't like didn't return his calls"". The funny thing is I was so quick to blame everyone at least once in this book for the bombs when their explanations as to why they had done what they did that day was such an easy answer. They were human beings that's why they made some of their choices, because high school and society is ugly and it affected each of these characters in different ways. From racism, to sexuality, to suicide, to perfection and religion. Every character experienced something which I was glad the author had happened. Because it just goes to show that we all go through something.. I didn't know who set off the bombs until I really started over thinking every aspect of each character, and when we finally figured out who it was all I could say was ""well damn"" that's kinda nuts.

30199,620,3560,"Alice's grandmother Althea is a famous writer. Alice has never met her grandmother and also hasn't read any of her stories. Ella wants Alice to stay away from her grandmother. She doesn't allow any contact. Bad luck is following Ella and Alice and Althea's estate, Hazel Wood, is the last place they should be. Ella and Alice are constantly on the run and they have moved many times, they leave as soon as what's following them is catching up. Alice is curious about Althea and her dark fairytales, but Ella isn't giving her any information. What is her mother keeping from her?

When Alice and Ella finally have some stability in their lives Ella disappears, she's taken by faul smelling people and there's a link between the abduction and Althea's stories. If Alice wants to find her mother she has to become part of her grandmother's dangerous world. However, Alice doesn't know anything about it. Fortunately one of her classmates is a big fan. Finch has read Althea's stories numerous times and he knows a lot about Alice's grandmother. Will he be able to help Alice with her search? Alice's mother warned her not to go to Hazel Wood, but that's exactly where they're headed. Will Alice finally discover her own story and will she be able to locate Ella? Alice is about to deal with dangerous magic, will she survive?

The Hazel Wood is a terrific gripping story. I was immediately intrigued by Alice. She has a fascinating multilayered personality. There are plenty of hidden depths in her character and Alice doesn't completely know herself. I loved the secrets that evolve around her, she has dreams, but she's ignorant about most of them and that made me really curious. Althea is a mystery and the worlds she writes about are dark, dangerous and intriguing. I couldn't wait to find out the connection between Alice's bad luck and her grandmother's stories. Alice's adventures kept me on the edge of my seat. While looking for her mother she finds herself in one bizarre situation after another and I was mesmerized by her journey from beginning to end.

Melissa Albert skillfully mixes worlds, realities, fairytales and dreams. I loved the way she describes Alice's personality, her family history and the tumultuous road she has to travel. Every part of it is exciting and filled with sparkling energy. I was impressed by the way Melissa Albert tells her story, it's controlled chaos, mixed with surreal twists and turns, devious enchantments and strange and complicated surprises. I greatly admired the creativity of the story, it's truly magical and absolutely spellbinding.

Sheer entertainment from the word go, this nostalgic thrill ride evokes all the wonderful nuances of the '80's but in the context of a future-looking (though arguably not-too-distant) wholly digital era! It's Goonies meets Avatar w/a splash of Willy Wonka as it taps into some of the decade's most iconic characters, movies, games, etc. in a race to complete the most eccentric scavenger hunt ever created! Rather than stuffing the ranging references down your throat, though, you get to relive your pop culture favorites simultaneous to the book's characters as they expand the limits of their imaginations in a Virtual Reality universe.  It begs the question of what uninhibited fantasies would you attempt to live out if given the platform to do so??

In that same vein, the book highlights prevailing modern-day concerns of what happens as human interaction and socialization take a backseat to texting, internet and home delivery.

30219,31,3848,"As per usual you just never know what you're going to get when you read a B.A. Paris. Well, that isn't exactly true, you do know you're probably going to get a boatload of crazy.
Paris doesnt just cross boundaries, she creates them. Watch her drawing those lines in the sand, the lines others are going to struggle to replicate or mirror, as she runs rings around her readers with this intricate plot. Its a think outside of the box kind of read.
As a reader you think you have the plot sussed and then the author just whacks you up the side of the head with a completely different solution and scenario.
In this case the #ForgetSleep tag couldn't be more accurate because your Sherlockian skills and grey cells will be asked to work overtime on Bring Me Back. Is Finn a killer? Did he forget the crime? Is she dead? Or is someone screwing with his already slightly unstable mind?
Finn has spent a lot of time recovering from the dark cloud of suspicion he has hanging over his head. The majority of people think he killed Layla, and it doesnt help that the new love of his life is the sister of his missing girlfriend. Its weird right?
Over a decade later the traumatic disappearance is brought back to the surface when a very specific item turns up, something that was really important to Layla and only a handful of people know about. It makes Finn doubt everything, even his relationship with Ellen. Its as if an invisible person is slowly chipping away at the fake exterior and trying to expose the real Finn. The Finn with anger issues, the Finn who is controlling, and the Finn who lied to the police. Yeh, that Finn.
What happened to Layla is the question of the hour, and what kind of secrets Finn keeps hidden in the dark recesses of his mind. Paris plays with the tension like a predator with its prey. Meanwhile the prey is confused as to what its role is, hence the switch from potential killer to violent abuser to whimpering victim. Its a bold, riveting read with a surprising conclusion.

Although history has not always viewed our first Treasury Secretary favorably, author Ron Chernow shows him as a man of genius who made an incredible positive impact in his few short years shaping America.

I was left highly disappointed with the dud of a reveal and disinterested in all the romance and minor bloodshed that followed because of it. But Im kind of a jerk when it comes to these things and you may love it.

Someone is killing the talented high school kids in terribly gruesome ways but, no worries, most of the gore is left to the imagination. This is basically a 90s teen slasher movie come to book life minus the scares and most of the grue. Who will be next? Why are they doing this? And, oh heck, who cares?! When will he give me a big sloppy kiss and bite his lip ring again?!

This is a romance set in a world where a serial killer just so happens to be murdering random people that have no impact on our main characters and zero emotional impact on the reader. The romance was well done and I liked the two teens together, they were interesting, imperfect kids, but I feel like too much went so very wrong with the murdering bits of the story. Also, many gut-wrenching opportunities were missed by keeping our main lovers too safe and that made reading it to the end a chore. I suppose Im used to meaner stories that kick you in the gut. This one? I guess Id recommend it as a good stepping stone for those who may want to meander over into the horror genre with their pinky toe and not get too scared or emotionally wrecked.

Ms. Gay does not like hugs. Through much of the book, I felt as if I were being dragged through a pity party of a self-indulged hunger that could never be satisfied. Like her sense of worthlessness. Of not deserving any better. Of denial. Of jealousy. Invisibility. And shame. The tone shifts toward the end. She's no longer young, in her 40s and an accomplished writer. She flies first class to speaking engagements. Her family is privy to her dark adolescent secret and still love her. She devotes a slim chapter toying with the idea of stalking her former lover who caused her descent into ruin. Her sensitivity to the hearing impaired brings a new reality to the bodies of others. Her last sentences are powerful: ""Here I am, finally freeing myself to be vulnerable and terribly human. Here I am, reveling in that freedom.""

I am always up for a good grief and loss book, and The Midnights absolutely fit the bill. It was filled with the pain we associate with losing a loved one, and the ways one may going about trying to fill the hole left in their heart.

Pro: Smetana beautifully depicted the emotional pain experienced by the characters in this book. The grief and suffering was utterly palpable.

Con: I know it's realistic for some people to spin a little out of control when they are grieving, but I had such a hard time with the choices Susannah was making.

Pro: The music references were so awesome. I really loved being pulled into Susannah's musical world, and I was truly fascinated by her songwriting process, her performances, and the bands who influenced her life.

Con: The book was kind of long, and had some parts, which didn't really seem necessary to the story.

Pro: I have been keeping track of where books are set, and it seems like a ton of books are set in California. However, I really thought Smetana's approach to describing the setting was different and interesting. She often focused on the weather elements, and connected them to the musical elements, which was different and a welcomed surprise.

Pro: The Midnight sessions Susannah shared with her father were quite special, and I thought it was brilliant the way these different ""midnights"" kept popping up throughout the story.

Pro: I had quite a fondness for Susannah's grandmother. She was a tough lady, but she was wise, and I really appreciated the way she tried to help Susannah see things from a different angle.

Pro: I was really proud of Susannah towards the end, and loved that she grew up a bit over the course of the story as she healed.

Overall: An emotional and affecting look at one teen's struggle with grief and her attempt to move on.",1521158400,4,rate 35 star alway good grief loss book midnight absolut fit bill fill pain associ lose love one way one may go tri fill hole left heart pro smetana beauti depict emot pain experienc charact book grief suffer utterli palpabl con know realist peopl spin littl control griev hard time choic susannah make pro music refer awesom realli love pull susannah music world truli fascin songwrit process perform band influenc life con book kind long part didnt realli seem necessari stori pro keep track book set seem like ton book set california howev realli thought smetana approach describ set differ interest often focus weather element connect music element differ welcom surpris pro midnight session susannah share father quit special thought brilliant way differ midnight kept pop throughout stori pro quit fond susannah grandmoth tough ladi wise realli appreci way tri help susannah see thing differ angl pro realli proud susannah toward end love grew bit cours

I read her books as a bit of a break from heavier, more literary novels and in that sense it definitely served its purpose. The main character, Sylvie, is similar to most of Kinsellas protagonists - sweet, kind hearted, a bit of a ditz, and quick to draw the wrong conclusions. Her husband, Dan, also follows the mold - lovable and reliable. The challenge initially is that, learning that their good health means that may have several decades left together, they aren't sure they can keep the love alive. It morphs into a deeper look at their relationship and their history/relationships with others (particularly in relation to Sylvies father).

30255,4939,3885,"I bought this for a class. It's okay, but I'd rather read some good fiction, or nonfiction about something I'm really interested in. On page 192 they give 4 questions to ask when evaluating a work of literature. Those questions might work for highbrow literary experts, but they don't work for me. I evaluate a story based on whether the beginning establishes an objective, a strong middle where the characters attempt to achieve their goal, and an ending where the objective is achieved.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001).

30257,3101,3564,"AUDIOBOOK NARRATOR:
I was annoyed with Sandra Burr.  She has a nice voice for general narration and women, but she is awful with men.  She lowers her voice to create weird male voices.  One guy sounded like a B-movie robot.  The hero wasn't as bad, but there was no emotional interpretation in his voice.  It was monotone and wooden.

Less of a problem, but it still annoyed me was her twang (southern-ish or hillbilly-ish).  She said hees instead of his  And she did ew instead of oo for example stewed (stood)  gewed (good)  shewed (should).  There are many actors who do a southern accent which I enjoy, but not this twang.

THE STORY:
Really bad plotting.  Some crimes happen and there is no logical investigation or questioning.  No logical evidence.  Wrong people are accused.  It was frustrating and not enjoyable.

When the main characters have a conflict or fight, illogical things were said.  I think the author was tired when she wrote this book since she couldn't come up with motivations fitting actions.

CAUTION SPOILERS ABOUT BAD PLOTTING:

Character A sees a dead woman and picks up the weapon/scissors.  B walks in and sees A with scissors.  B says A killed her.  For the rest of the book everyone believes A killed her.  No one even asks, did B sees A stab the victim?  Or could someone else have done it?  No,  During the entire book, all characters say A killed her.  There was no evidence or investigation or anything to question it.  When someone wanted to talk about the murder, most of the characters would say I don't want to talk about it.

Character A could not defend himself because he was high on drugs at the time of the murder and couldn't remember what happened.  A couple times later he said he killed her.  But that was not true, he was just feeling guilty because he wasn't the best husband.  But the author used that comment to confuse the issue - not interesting.

The bad guy has no part in the story until the very end.  So we don't even get to watch his actions and motives during the story.  That might have made things better, but no.  Hes introduced at the very end.

Also the ending was too sad for me about an innocent man being in prison for 20 years.

A similar thing happened with a second crime.  The victim sees his property destroyed and immediately says his ex girlfriend did it.  That was not true but he assumes it was her.  No one investigates or asks about her alibi until the very end of the book.  But for the rest of the book all the characters talk about the exgirlfriend doing this.

30270,1849,87,"I really, really wanted to like this book. I feel bad for giving this a two-star rating, because it was well-written, very creative, thoughtful, emotional, and definitely had some recurring themes, motifs, and elements. But I just didn't like it. I found myself getting to about 45% and wishing the book was over. I found it kind of boring, I didn't care about the characters (and didn't by the end either), I didn't care about hockey, high school drama, or any of the relationships. I found myself not caring about the team, the underlying themes or struggles of each character or the town, their personal issues or the awful, terrible, vulgar, crude teenage culture. I couldn't relate to any of the characters or situations and I really disliked most of the characters in this book and found them uninteresting (except Amat).

This book so was so focused on sports and youth culture that I could barely get through it. I am sure there are people who love that kind of thing, I just didn't, at all. Unlike ""A Man Called Ove"" (which I really liked) this book was crude, vulgar, violent, with depictions of multiple situations that would certainly be a cause for a ""trigger-warning"" for those sensitive and apathetic towards those situations. It was just hard to get through. The end of this book left me feeling sad and sick to my stomach and I wish I hadn't read this book.

If you like violence, teenage culture, small-town drama and politics, sports stories, scandal, high-tension situations, and hockey: this book is for you.

30273,2721,1814,"I had a lot of fun reading this book. The plot kept me so interested that I finished within a day of receiving it (very unusual for me), and it was a lot of fun to read about the creative problem solving it took to navigate the scenarios the main character faced.

The prose wasn't very complicated, making it easy to get through the book fast - however, some of the technical terms for the moon's industries and the space equipment still were hard for me to wrap my head around.

The character of Jazz gave me mixed feelings. I have a lot of respect for her as an interesting woman character, with a compelling backstory, and I enjoyed the counterbalance of her sketchy ethics to her strong sense of honesty and reliability. Even though she wasn't a ""good person,"" she was a good character. I also enjoyed how empowered she was by intelligence, quick wit, and being the leader of the smuggling industry on the moonnot a lot of female characters get such good portrayal!

However, I also didn't really.... like her? She is sort of a disparaging person who interacts with others primarily through brutal honesty, in the form of a lot of deadpan humor and sarcasm. She was almost funny, but a lot of my laughter was half hearted; the one-liners felt forced and unbelievable, and it was baffling for me how easily sheand the other charactersgot away with so much brutal honesty. Maybe she was unbelievable, or maybe she's just different than what I'm used to.

30274,620,3231,"In Sempera time is precious. Time, when extracted from someone's blood, can be bound to iron, which is being turned into a currency that can be consumed to increase someone's number of years. However, for a lot of people this means they constantly have to bleed to pay their debts and therefore shorten their lives, while very few members of the country's nobility thrive and live for centuries. Jules and her father used to work at Everless, an estate owned by a noble family. For Jules Everless was home, until they had to leave because of an incident that made them outcasts in just a few moments. Now they're poor and Jules has to find a way to bring in some coins.

Jules's father has given a lot of his time away and is dying. Jules wants to save him, but the only way she can earn enough coins to make up for everything he's already lost, is finding work as a servant at Everless. She's several years older than the child that was sent away and hopes the problems of the past will be forgotten. Will she be recognized? When Jules is in Everless she discovers that her departure was surrounded by secrets. While her father warned her to stay away from Everless and the country's nobility, Jules is too curious to follow his advice. She knows she's in danger, but has no idea about the extent of it. What will happen when she discovers the truth? Will she still feel the same about the people who were once an important part of her past and does she have the strength to change her own future?

Everless is a fascinating and gripping story. Jules lives in a world where time is money, literally. Those who are poor won't live very long. I admired this creative idea and Sarah Holland's execution is flawless. Jules is a strong heroine, she loves with all her heart and she's incredibly generous. She will go far to save the people she cares about and I loved her fierce personality. She isn't afraid to put herself in danger if it means she'll get the answers she needs, which makes thrilling reading. I really liked Jules and was captivated by her difficult situation from the start. I read Everless in one sitting, because I couldn't wait to find out more about all the secrets in this amazing book.

Sara Holland has written a fantastic original story. I love her world building skills and was impressed by her beautiful descriptive writing that makes the story come to life in a terrific raw way. Jules lives in a twisted and cruel world and Sara Holland perfectly describes every aspect of her perilous and heartbreaking existence. She also knows how to divide tension, which makes Everless a fabulous story to read.

30275,1136,3791,"For a decade in California, from 1976 to 1986, an unknown serial rapist terrorized more than fifty people. Initially, his victims were women. Later, his crimes would include couples. Eventually, sexual assault escalated to murder.

Dubbed the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker (EAR/ONS), the predator somehow managed to evade police, despite dozens of investigations spanning numerous jurisdictions. His elusive nature, combined with the senseless acts of violence that he committed against so many, prompted true crime writer and journalist Michelle McNamara to study the case years later.

The search for the EAR/ONSwhom McNamara named the Golden State Killerconsumed McNamara, who spent countless hours researching possible suspects, theories, and clues. She connected with the case on a visceral level. Fascinated with true crime since she was a teenager, when a neighborhood girl was murdered by an unknown assailant, McNamara dedicated much of her life to researching cold cases. She documented her work on her website, True Crime Diary.

Sadly, McNamara passed away while in the process of writing this book, which was later completed by her co-researchers as well as her husband, comedian Patton Oswalt. To this day, the Golden State Killer has never been captured.

It feels terribly wrong that McNamara didn't get the chance to complete the work that she was so dedicated tofinally seeing the Golden State Killer brought to justice. But her work lives on, and the compassion she felt for the many victims is a worthy legacy indeed.

If you enjoy a great mystery filled with twists and turns and a shaky -- at best -- narrator who tells her story full throttle, this is the book for you.

Dr. Anna Fox has sentenced herself to a life of solitary confinement.  She is dependent on pills and drinks plenty of wine to wash them down.  She cannot leave her home.  She keeps in contact with her husband and daughter through calls.  She has little or no contact with the outside world, save for her cat and a few professional people who come calling.  She keeps herself occupied with her computer, her wine, and keeping tabs on her neighbors.  Hence, the title.

To say too much about this thriller would be to ruin it for others.  You just have to get the book and dive in - and the water is fine!  Author A.J. Finn keeps you guessing, keeps you turning the pages, and has some surprises in store for you.  However, there were a few plots that I figured out before the author verified my guesses but this didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of this book.

30280,1781,3826,"This has to be one of my favorite books by the author. She has mixed Amish country, gangs and DEA agents into one action packed story that should be made into a movie. The premise of the story is about Calvin coming back to his roots because his brother is ill. There are some hard feelings between the brothers that are very evident as they see each other. I loved how the author showed how bitterness can get in the way of relationships. Calvin has some deep secrets that could harm those he cares about. Will his presence back home bring danger to the community? I really liked Calvin because he wanted to do the right thing and hopefully along the way find forgiveness from his family. It would be hard for a family member to come back home after knowing he has been involved with illegal dealings. I wanted Calvin and his brother Mark to find their way back to each other. The author does an exceptional job of showing the dynamics between the two brothers and their lifestyle. Sometimes it isn't easy to come back home.

Alice was the sweetest person I have read about. She is lovely, caring and adores her job as a gifted preschool teacher. When she runs into Calvin you could feel the uncomfortable feeling Alice had. Its not everyday she runs into a man dressed liked Calvin. His rugged good lucks did intrigue her and I kept thinking how opposites attract. I really liked how Alice and Calvin slowly started to each other. It must have been hard for them to let their guard down. Sometimes a girl is just attracted to the bad boy and Alice can't fight her feelings for Calvin.

The story is filled with intrigue and danger that heightened the story to a level of excellence. The author does an amazing job of giving us glimpses into Calvin's secret life. I'm not sure I could put myself in danger like he did. I came to really like him and loved watching his transformation. The ending is so powerful and edgy that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Fans of the author are in for a treat with this explosive story. Will Calvin be able to save his family and Alice from danger? There are a few other characters in the story that are a vital part to Calvin and his secret life. I won't say much more, but be prepared to be surprised and feel a bit sad as this explosive story takes us to the depths of evil where prayer and forgiveness will be needed. I enjoyed being reminded that we shouldn't judge someone by the way they look or where they come from. People can change and we need to give everyone a chance.

30282,185,1814,"I'm rounding up about half a star.

Andy Weir's latest novel has key elements in common with his debut bestseller The Martian: a highly resourceful  and entertaining character, facing plenty of crises to be resourceful about, with many scientific and technical details provided re both crises and solutions. The protagonist is quite different, at least in superficial respects: a young woman (though it took me a few pages to realize her gender), prickly and foul-mouthed, with firm if idiosyncratic rules for what lines she will and won't cross, entangled in the aftermath of what she freely describes as dumb life decisions. My feelings about Jazz transformed pretty thoroughly as the book went on, from (briefly) irritation and lack of sympathy to wholehearted hope for her success and well-being.

I enjoyed the book's approach to a dual timeline, with the present day alternating with her correspondence with (initially) her off-planet penpal.

30283,480,3887,"In this comprehensive work on Paul, we see not only the theology, but also the social, cultural, and political dynamics that helped to form his thinking. The book takes a chronological perspective starting with his Jewish upbringing, follows him through his conversion to a follower of Jesus and his journeys to the early Christian communities.

The book is well written and easy to follow even if you're not a Paul scholar. I found the early chapters some of the most interesting. Its easy to ignore the fact that the early Christians living in world shaped by political and social realities. Paul was raised in the Jewish tradition and the scope of that history had a significant bearing on his later writing.

My other favorite chapter was the last chapter where Wright puts the whole thing together. He emphasizes that Pauls concept of love and the outward looking church were significant factors in the way Christian communities developed and responded to social challenges. He suggests this world view  was responsible for founding hospitals to care for everyone and for the development of education.

Weaving the cultural and historical factors of the time into Pauls story and teachings made the scriptures come alive for me. I highly recommend this book. Whether you're a Paul scholar or even particularly religious, this book will make you think and, I hope, bring a new level of understanding to Pauls Letters.

It was a very, very slow build but the last section was full of suspense and action. I liked how the author built a crazy tower of a tale and then in the last chapters gave a great pay off.

30295,2447,652,"Two Kinds of Truth consists of two kinds of over-lapping novels  an action thriller and a locked room mystery.  Or I should say a sealed container mystery.

In the thriller, Harry Bosch, exiled from the LAPD and now working for the San Fernando Police Department, investigates the murder of father and son pharmacists and goes undercover into the dangerous world of illegal drug dealing.  He encounters a desperate woman worth saving.

In the mystery, Harry is the target of an investigation that threatens to trash his reputation as a tough but honest detective.  An inmate on death row, convicted of murder 30 years ago, insists that Harry framed him by planting evidence.  A DNA remnant in a file box that was taped shut supports his claim that someone else is guilty.  A slick defense attorney and an ambitious deputy DA demand a judicial hearing that the convict be freed.  If they prevail, the city could be expected to pay millions in a settlement.

The two stories are connected by a photo of Harry in The Los Angeles Times seen by two Russians who run a criminal opioid enterprise.  Homeless elderly addicts are recruited to take phony prescriptions to pharmacies and give the pills to their cappers for resale.  Harry disguises himself as one of the pill shills.  The Russians confront him near the open door of an airplane over the Salton Sea.

Back to the locked container mystery.  Mickey Haller, the Lincoln Lawyer in earlier Connelly novels who is Harrys half-brother, takes Harrys case.  Mickey  for whom the end justifies the means when defending a client  manages to intervene in the hearing.  Can he rescue Harry from the conspirators determined to destroy him?

Harry believes there are two kinds of truth: What you know to be true and what politicians and corrupt lawyers and their clients say is true.  There is a third truth: These two stories add up to a heck of a good read.",1521158400,5,two kind truth consist two kind overlap novel action thriller lock room mysteri say seal contain mysteri thriller harri bosch exil lapd work san fernando polic depart investig murder father son pharmacist goe undercov danger world illeg drug deal encount desper woman worth save mysteri harri target investig threaten trash reput tough honest detect inmat death row convict murder 30 year ago insist harri frame plant evid dna remnant file box tape shut support claim someon el guilti slick defens attorney ambiti deputi da demand judici hear convict freed prevail citi could expect pay million settlement two stori connect photo harri lo angel time seen two russian run crimin opioid enterpris homeless elderli addict recruit take phoni prescript pharmaci give pill capper resal harri disguis one pill shill russian confront near open door airplan salton sea back lock contain mysteri mickey haller lincoln lawyer earlier connelli novel harri halfbroth take harri case mickey end justifi mean defend client manag interven hear rescu harri conspir determin destroy harri believ two kind truth know true politician

30300,502,455,"Sometimes when you see a title, and the author's name along with it, an immediate question mark might enter your brain. My Amazon recommendations suggested IQ by a man named Joe Ide. My attention was immediately caught, but is the man for real? To put it real simple, if you're writing your debut, and the title is IQ, then youd better know what you're doing!

Welcome to East Long Beach, where the LAPD can barely keep up, and a young man that not a lot of people know about just might be able to help you out. Isaiah Quintabe is his name, he goes by IQ, and solvin crime is his game. So what if hes a high school dropout. The man has some brains, and people who work for rapper stand-out Black the Knife are looking for answers. Theres bad guys out there that want to get Cal, AKA, Black the Knife, and cut him up like a knife, and feed him to the dogs! A little man named Dodson calls Isaiah, and IQ is on the case.

When you're bad, you're bad. Just ask Skip. At least, he goes by Skip, and hes not the least bit afraid of some kid named IQ asking questions, but he wants to eliminate him. Hes got the dogs to do it, because he almost ended a hot-shot rapper, and Skips not about to be crossed.

For what I love to read, I did consider this to be racy, yet acceptable. Joe Ide has the approval of Carl Hiaasen, John Sandford, Peter Spiegelman, Stephen Hunter, and then some. And as a new author, hes got my attention.

30301,1200,64,"This book started out really strong but ended with a meh feeling.  I feel like it had so much potential that just kind of fizzled out and deflated about two thirds in.

I want to be as spoiler free as possible so I'm gonna be kind of vague.

I liked the heroine.  She uses multiple names but the one used the most is Alex.  She's very strong, mentally and emotionally.  Not so much physically but she absolutely makes up for it with brains.  I was intrigued by her and felt drawn to read more about her and what got her into this dangerous situation.

So in comes this man. She's told he's a terrorist.  She follows him, kidnaps him, and then tortures him.  But turns out he's not really a terrorist and she's just been set up.  Then it's a whole new ball game.  In comes another character, and it snowballs from there.  They're on the run while also trying to take down whoever is after them.

My issue here is that man #1 is totally into Alex.  She tortured him and he then follows her around like a puppy.  Um what?  He's just too perfect and forgiving.  I could get behind a romance between them AFTER a certain period of time where he hates her a little bit.  But he never does.  He just let's it go.  That's not normal

And then there was no real sexual tension.  The attraction didn't make sense to me.  This is coming from someone who's read hundreds of romance novels with various levels of intensity.  I get that Ms. Meyer wrote a ""clean"" story because of her personal background, but this romantic relationship wasn't believable to me at all.  He was claiming to be in love with her a few days after she kidnapped and tortured him. It just didn't make sense.

My other big issue was the ""climax"" of the book where she and the guys supposedly find out who put the hit out on them.  Except that it's just a calculated guess!  Alex just decides that it must be this one guy because his last name starts with P.......NO concrete evidence, NO files, NO video or recordings incriminating him.  Then they immediately decide to kill him!  With no real proof!  The whole thing baffled me!

So I give this a 3 cause it's well written and had a great beginning and good backstory on all the characters.  But losing two starts because I got lost about two thirds through. I felt like it could have been 100-150 pages shorter and been much better.

There is ZERO language in this book.  Not even the more mild words  No sex scenes.  Just kissing that always gets interrupted.  BUT LOTS of violence, torture, murder, fist fights, guns/shooting etc...",1521158400,3,book start realli strong end meh feel feel like much potenti kind fizzl deflat two third want spoiler free possibl im gonna kind vagu like heroin use multipl name one use alex she strong mental emot much physic absolut make brain intrigu felt drawn read got danger situat come man she told he terrorist follow kidnap tortur turn he realli terrorist she set whole new ball game come anoth charact snowbal theyr run also tri take whoever issu man 1 total alex tortur follow around like puppi um he perfect forgiv could get behind romanc certain period time hate littl bit never let go that normal real sexual tension attract didnt make sen come someon who read hundr romanc novel variou level intens get m meyer wrote clean stori person background romant relationship wasnt believ claim love day

30310,1767,3620,"There is a certain dry, sardonic wit common to many British novels--a slightly understated, slid in dig that can go unnoticed or over the head.  To be honest, it took me a few chapters to settle into the rhythm of the novel and start really enjoying myself.  But as the plot unfolded (and the body count rose) and my own gray cells started trying to keep up with the inspector's I found myself virtually flipping through the pages as fast as I could to see if Purbright could beat the reaper.

 I would place the time of the action at about early Dr. Who (which had some of that same sly humor)--no cell phones, no computers and, sadly for the detective, no Tardis.

 The UK publisher Farrago (Prelude) seems to search out the overlooked and underappreciated gems of 20th century humor and mystery of which this is clearly one, so I look for Farrago/Prelude titles on NetGalley and am seldom disappointed, nor am I this time, and am eager to continue reading this series as it is (re?) introduced to the American public.",1521158400,4,certain dri sardon wit common mani british novelsa slightli underst slid dig go unnot head honest took chapter settl rhythm novel start realli enjoy plot unfold bodi count rose gray cell start tri keep inspector found virtual flip page fast could see purbright could beat reaper would place time action earli dr sli humorno cell phone comput sadli detect tardi uk publish farrago prelud seem search overlook underappreci gem 20th centuri humor mysteri clearli one look farragoprelud titl netgalley seldom disappoint time eager continu read seri introduc american public
30311,3901,3830,"I love to hunker down with a good police drama and mystery thriller. I have been lucky to read one of this authors works prior to this new release so I was excited to dive into this story.

Its funny how involved I get into a book when it is written well and the story flows. This book seemed slow to start as the author winds you up and walks you into the subtle nuances of issues, crimes, weirdness that starts in the characters lives. You look back and realize that the author has been dropping these hints all along the way. So that slowness in the beginning was simply setting the stage.

This book had a ton of changes in direction, twists, and minute details that added up into a crime fiction that will set you on edge. Mackintosh keeps you guessing until the every end and then even carries it into a foreshadowing for more to come maybe.

With fine detail, engrossing writing that ramps up with every page turn, Let Me Lie is an imaginative novel that is not to be missed by those that love a great crime story.

30319,1071,2979,"Savage Run is the second Joe Pickett novel and it was another fun read. Though theres still a blatant political message here, it was a good story. One could look at it as another preachy tome, while if you step back and take it as a plot device, the environmental message and the author using it for full effect, welljust go with it. It works.

Im not one to look too deeply into the horses mouth (okay, its a clich), but I had a great time with this novel. I like Joe and his family, and after reading the much more recent ones, Im now filling in all the blanks in his history.

The way this one plays out, it could be hard to overlook the authors obvious biases, but at the same time, it does present another viewpoint from someone who lives the life, or sort of does. He at least lives in the general area, so he understands the culture there, rather than those of us that live in more urban areas.

With that in mind, he paints such a vivid picture of the life in the wilds of Wyoming and the big country. You can just about feel it through his pages. Thats one thing that draws me to his books, that and the characters.

I just try to ignore the preaching through the story, which can be hard at times. On the other hand, hes not the only writer that does this on either side of the spectrum and I can understand why he likes to promote his side of things from where he lives.

The writing was excellent with solid third-person, past-tense with only occasional head-hopping which almost, but not quite jerked me out of the story. The narrative was brisk and the story moved, which made reading this novel a breeze. With a cast of likable characters and despicable bad guys, its the kind of story I like.

Given whatever preaching might be there, this was still a very entertaining story.

30324,574,2914,"Once again we a treated to three POVs and three storylines but unlike Shattered these work seamlessly.

Atticus has issues with the vampires and their leader Theophilus. Enough is enough and its time to take a stand. To do this, he will face danger, severe ties, suffer loss and will end up carrying guilt but with a price on the druids heads, Atticus is determined to be the victor. This thread has him reconnecting with characters from previous books as he does quite a bit of traveling in his quest. The Hammers of God was an interesting thread and I loved how Hearne brought them back in and feed my quest for knowledge regarding them.  The Dark Elves also made an appearance and continue to fascinate me.

After Granuaile s experiences in India, she is determined to be free of the mark, the Norse God Loki set upon her.  To do this she enlists the help of the gods and the witches in Poland. This was an intense thread that has her facing several Slavic nightmares. She also continued her quest regarding her stepfather. I like Granuaile but I would be lying if I didn't say that her POV sometimes grates on my nerves. She is passionate but also youthful in her reactions.

The third POV is Owen, who has decided to teach again and is spending time with a certain werewolf and her clan. In Staked, Owen has a wee bit of trouble with trolls. This thread was intense, heartbreaking and tied to the overall series ARC as Owen makes a startling discovery concerning an enemy.

Oberon and Orliath were present and added humor, emotion, and talks of food to the story. While I enjoy Orilath, but Oberon continues to steal the show. One of my favorite side stories in Staked had to do with a ghost and I enjoyed how Hearne both shared events from Atticuss past and addressed ghostly entities.

The stories eventually wove together when Atticus and the other druids join him in Rome as he takes on Theophilus. These final scenes were intense and had me sitting up straight and listening intensely.

Luke Daniels continues to narrate the series and I think he will be as sad as I will be when the final novel releases.

30328,1658,20,"This month in my book club, it was my pick. I have been dying to read Little Fires Everywhere going on a year now  seriously  but just haven't had the time with review work obligations. I really need to find a better balance of work reading versus pleasure reading, especially as my TBR pile has multiplied to a ridiculous amount, spilling from my bedside table onto my desk, with the excess stacked up in two dangerously tall piles in my library.

Little Fires Everywhere did not disappoint. And Im glad of it, since my pleasure reading time is so precious to me. Im also always a little nervous when picking a book for my book club. Id hate to pick a dud (my friend Kelley did one month and we haven't let her live it down yet, ha ha!) and Im always conscious of everyone elses reading preferences. We are a bit of an eclectic mix who fall into several different reading preference categories, but the four of us generally can agree if a book is good or bad. Ive been waiting on pins and needles to hear if they liked Fires as much as I did and luckily, they enjoyed it nearly as much as I did.

This book was . . . well, overall, it was simply a portrait of human character. It carefully and thoughtfully peeled back the layers of the contributing factors give a person their personality, whether it be person, place, thing, or idea. Whether it be setting or circumstance. Time or space. Or all of the above. It detailed the nuances that keep a personality in its place, and what sways a person to make the decisions they make. It got raw, and it got dirty. At times, it was hauntingly real in the way that the author could slice right down the middle of the characters insecurities and lay them open and bare.

Of course, there were some instances where the details got a little too deep and a little too particular. There were so many characters that the back and forth of  points of view became a bit tedious, your mind wandering from this person to that. It was hard to get attached to any one character, but in reflection, I wondered if this was the authors intent. We discussed it in my book club . . . how the characters could sometimes feel a little flat. Again, I argued that perhaps this was the intention all along. Shaker Heights is a real place, and author Celeste Ng grew up there. Was she poking fun at her traditional and ideally flawless little town? This book was not perfect, but it was a page-turner. There was a plethora of winding and twisty turning story-lines constantly weaving in and out of one another, making it feel like you were wrapped up in a daytime soap opera. They nestled into one another like Russian dolls, each characters path fitting inside the others with flush precision. And the ending . . . well. It was an ending, I can say that much.

The town of Shaker Heights is full of little houses made of ticky-tacky, just like the song suggests. The people there are the epitome of cookie-cutter, even in the standard way they strive for diversity and range. Everything has its place and its purpose; every shade of skin color is accounted for in much the same way that the colors of the houses are chosen. It is a masterfully planned community, right down to the studs.

There are rules in Shaker Heights, rules on how many trees you have to have in your yard or where your garbage can can be (and at what time it can be there). Rules on speed limits and how many animals each home can handle. And for the most part  it all works. The residents of Shaker Heights take their community and its way of life as something to be treasured; it is a Utopia and must be treated as such.

Mrs. Richardson grew up in Shaker Heights and never had any desire to leave the comforting motherly embrace the town provided. She thrived on the structure and glory that the town slowly embedded in her over the years; Shaker Heights carefully watched as she grew from adolescent into woman, and Elena Richardson hoped her children would grow up in her image. After all, who could want more than a tidy little existence in a tidy little town? No surprises, no nastiness, everything remained clean and beautiful and idyllic.

Trip and Moody Richardson are her sons, and they are the epitome of what embodies the Shaker Heights Young Man. Trip plays sports and has rugged good looks that have captured the eye of many a young lady. Moody lives up to his name and spends feverish afternoons writing in his journal or riding around the quiet tree-lined streets on his bike. Mrs. Richardsons oldest daughter Lexie is equally appealing with her WASPish good looks and beauty queen smile. But then theres Izzy, the black sheep . . . the odd girl out . . . the child who must always question everything and insists on going her own way, especially if its against the grain. Izzy is the child who always has a problem shoved up her sleeve, always ready to throw it like a bomb on a battlefield.

Izzy has always been difficult, even a as a young child. Mrs. Richardson even insists that she knew Izzy would be trouble even as the infant floated around in her womb. Thankfully she has become a little more manageable since the Warren family came to town, spending her after-school hours as a pseudo assistant to the enigmatic artist instead of plotting her next revenge. Mia Warren and her daughter Pearl drove into Shaker Heights from God knows where and planted themselves in the Richardsons investment property, renting out the upstairs space and setting down some not-so-firm roots. Mia is a photographer of some sort, a job that the formally educated Mrs. Richardson could never understand. The whimsical Mia, with her peasant skirts and thrift store bracelets, spends her days creating what she calls art from nothing . . . fragments of their little town distorted into images manipulated in a dark room to suit Mias whim and fancy. Her daughter Pearl possesses a quiet shyness that borders on socially awkward, never having been in one place long enough to make friends organically. But Pearl and Moody, they have caught on like fire, and it feels as if you cant find one without finding the other since the Warrens move to Shaker Heights.

It doesnt take long for the wounds to begin showing through the worn bandage, the blood vivid and shiny. While Shaker Heights appears perfect on the outside, scratching softly upon the surface allows whats underneath to show. When a prominent family in town announces their impending adoption of a little Asian baby, the real trouble begins. Mia Warren quietly and deftly inserts herself into the equation, urging those around her to do the same. She knows who that baby really belongs to and she knows the situation is going to get messy. But shes been in messy places before, shes had to make hard choices in her dark past, and she knows that she cant walk away from what is in front of her. Not like she did before.

The case of the baby will split the town into two equal pieces, throwing neighbors in separate chasms and pitting lifelong friends against one another. Mia Warren will be at the center of it all, her daughter an extension, and Mrs. Richardsons family threaded into the scandal as purveyors of what they believe to be true justice. Will the ties that bind be enough to keep the family together, or will Izzy burn it all down around them  as is her custom?

Little Fires Everywhere is the newest novel by Celeste Ng, and has taken book clubs around the country by storm. Hulu has announced an impending development of the book into a limited television series, and Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington have attached themselves to the project. A quick and enticing read, Fires catches the reader from early on, allowing its burn to spread and gather as the pages turn and the story builds on top of itself. Layer upon layer is applied, in a touch so tender you barely see it coming. It is appropriate for ages 15+, and touches on relationships from that particular age group all the way into adulthood. There are more than a few frank discussions about sex and pregnancy, but it is all very relevant to the plot and situation that readers of all ages will be able to relate to.

The takeaway in my book club for this particular novel was that while the book was an easy and fun read, it was also viewed by some as a story was a little too young for their taste; a touch too YA fiction instead of adult. While the plot is split between points of view, and quite a few of those characters are indeed teenagers, I personally didn't find it to be an issue. For me personally, the overall feeling was that of an adult fiction novel.

Thats probably what I love best about my book club  we are all such different readers coming from different walks of life and points of view, and we can be hit by the same book in totally conflicting ways. It makes for a great group discussion, and our differences always lead to growth in my book comfort zone.

I give Little Fires Everywhere 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to those who like easy and fast reads that are engaging and full of mystery. It is both plot and character driven which makes it semi-unique, and while the development is not strong in the character sense, the plot more than makes up for it. Readers who enjoyed Liane Moriartys Big Little Lies or Ann Patchetts Commonwealth would equally enjoy Little Fires Everywhere.",1521158400,4,month book club pick die read littl fire everywher go year serious havent time review work oblig realli need find better balanc work read versu pleasur read especi tbr pile multipli ridicul amount spill bedsid tabl onto desk excess stack two danger tall pile librari littl fire everywher disappoint im glad sinc pleasur read time preciou im also alway littl nervou pick book book club id hate pick dud friend kelley one month havent let live yet ha ha im alway consciou everyon el read prefer bit eclect mix fall sever differ read prefer categori four u gener agre book good bad ive wait pin needl hear like fire much luckili enjoy nearli much book well overal simpli portrait human charact care thought peel back layer contribut factor give person person whether person place thing idea whether set circumst time space detail nuanc keep person place sway person make decis make got raw got dirti time hauntingli real way

30335,573,3874,"Well, all the gritty, desperate, struggle-for-survival excitement comes down to this third and final book of The Illuminae Files Young Adult Sci-Fi series.  Each book has kept the thriller action in space taunt with tension and desperation so that I was at near distraction waiting for my pre-ordered book arrive.

Obsidio, as book three, is not a good place to start.  This is a series that needs to be read in order for all the clues in the conspiracy and building series action to make sense.

Each book is presented as a case file documenting the extent of a travesty that various key players are trying to make known so that justice may be found for all the victims, dead and alive. The big picture is only fully revealed by this last book.

I went into Obsidio worried that it couldn't live up to all the build up and promise of the first two books, but I soon learned to set that aside.  Things have come full circle and its for all the marbles as all the key players find themselves engaged in an epic battle for survival and if not survival, the opportunity to tell the true story of what happened when Bei Tech military attacked a civilian illegal mining colony to gain control of the mining resources and began a war between two big monopolies with the civilians caught in the middle.

Like the others before it, this book pulls no punches with catastrophic events and devastation.  It really does a good job of making one see what being in the middle of a war is really like particularly for non-combatants who must step up just to survive.  This is a young adult in that the main figures who are the movers and shakers are teens, but I think it is a series that is actually suited to adult readers maybe moreso.  There is a ruthless, dark and desperate quality to it.

But, like the first two books, a romance pair emerges.  Granted, they are living on the edge of life and death so its not a prime focus, but a second chance romance is there and I enjoyed seeing them worth through mistrust, assumptions, and their continued connection in spite of it all.

Now, what takes this beyond a typical sci-fi space adventure is the epistolary format of the book.  It's told in security feeds, messages, memos, graphic art, and more.  My only niggles is that at times the lighter shaded script was hard to read. The security feeds are told in an omniscient observer narrator who quips and comments on what he or she is observing.  One might think this would make it hard to engage with the story, but in truth, I had no trouble getting emotionally involved and teared up or laughed out more than once.  I found the notes Isaac left all those teen heroes on the eve of battle poignant, Nic's crazy need to go around with a spacesuit and parachute with it was whimsical, Ella's snark or Aidan (my bittersweet homicidal favorite AI)'s thoughts were also hits.

I have book hangover now and really don't want to leave this series behind.  It was stellar all around and I will definitely be going for a re-read at some point.

I read her books as a bit of a break from heavier, more literary novels and in that sense it definitely served its purpose. The main character, Sylvie, is similar to most of Kinsellas protagonists - sweet, kind hearted, a bit of a ditz, and quick to draw the wrong conclusions. Her husband, Dan, also follows the mold - lovable and reliable. The challenge initially is that, learning that their good health means that may have several decades left together, they aren't sure they can keep the love alive. It morphs into a deeper look at their relationship and their history/relationships with others (particularly in relation to Sylvies father).

30344,3460,3874,"I finally finished the conclusion to Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoffs hit series, The Illuminae Files, Obsidio! It was as awesome as expected! All expectations were exceeded, as expected! Lol! In this final installment we meet a new set of characters and also get to see the ones weve already fell in love with as well, which I wasn't expecting so much to the degree it was met at, so that was a happy surprise!

We meet Kadys cousin, Asha Grant as she lives on Kerenza IV and is a part of a secret rebel group that is trying to get rid of BeiTech who have taken over their home. Life on Kerenza has changed drastically with food shortages and curfews and of course, the soldiers who tear apart their planet. Things are crazy! So when Asha comes face to face with her ex-boyfriend, Rhys, who just happens to be a team member of BeiTech things get dicey. Ashas fellow rebels think that Rhys can be turned over to their side and be used as an inside man, but Asha isn't too sure. Theres a lot of history between her and Rhys and not all of it was pleasant.

We also get to see segments between Kady, Ezra, Ella, Nik, and Hannah as well as they are trying to band together their motley crew of survivors from the ships that have previously fell. But the odds are against them as they will not have enough food and oxygen to last them on their journey to Kerenza to take down BeiTech. Not only that, but theres tension in the air regrading Syra being the new leader and her plans for the crew.

And what would the story be without our favorite AI, AIDAN? AIDAN will always be a mystery to me. Ignoring the fact that its a computer, but the way it actually thinks and perhaps even feels? Its scary, yet not. It acts in the way a human might when it comes the hard decisions. The fact that it has lasted this long in the trilogy always baffled me, and oddly, not. It makes sense for AIDAN to continue to play a role in the course of things.

I truly never thought a book like Illuminae, Gemina, and Obsidio would hold my attention so tight. Upon hearing that the story is told in a course of emails, notices, video chats, and an assortment of other type documents, I was never really sure how a story could unfold and yet still make sense. But Amie and Jay truly make this process work! I could never even fathom the idea of writing like this for the entire book! All 600+ pages of it! Of course we had a good deal of artwork to enjoy on some of these pages as well, some of which was illustrated by the fabulous Marie Lu!

The Illuminae Files is definitely a sight to behold! This is without a doubt one of the most unique series Ive ever had the pleasure of reading! It blew me away from the getgo and held me entranced for just as long! Ive always struggled with futuristic/space-ish books, but with this series I was able to fall into the story so easily, so seamlessly, that when I finally turned the last page, I was saddened that there wasn't more. I was even more saddened this time around as this is the final book of the trilogy!

There was plenty of action in this one! If you think a book composed of chats, letters, notices, and emails cant be thrilling and on the edge of your seat riddled with action, youd be wrong! There was plenty of action and suspense in this one! Moments that had me gasping and holding my breath! The added romances between the three starring couples were still acknowledge as well, I suspected seeing Asha and Rhys rekindle their old flame and fighting it as well, but being able to see moments with the other two was a happy surprise! Speaking of which, there were surprises at every turn in this epic story and my emotions were basically continually punched over and over with the ordeals that Amie and Jay made me go through.

Obsidio was the thrill ride adventure I had been so badly waiting for ever since reading Gemina two years ago! It had everything I was hoping for in a finale and then some! I hope that this will not be the last time Amie and Jay write a series together because these two are just incredible awesome. Mind. Blown.

Bravo!

30346,1606,3874,"Man, oh man. I don't know how many times my jaw dropped during this final installment of The Illuminae Files but Obsidio was a perfect ending to an amazing story. So much tension, so many twists! That story, that presentation, that HUMOR! Those plots, those book jackets! And, those characters...

I know I am supposed to be reviewing Obsidio, but this is a package deal. Illuminae, Gemina, and Obsidio. I cannot help but rave about the entire series. You can't have one without the other two.

Jay Kristoff and Amie Kaufman took a story that in lesser hands would be just another sci-fi outerspace story and turned it into an epic experience like no other. A greed-driven corporation invades an illegally built mining colony in no one knows you're out there outer space and a bunch of teenagers attempt to take it on and save the universe. It's been done before, right?

Not. Like. This.

For one, the stories are told through the contents of a set of files created by a faceless entity known as ""The Illuminae Group"". Collected by The Illuminae to expose the attack on the colony, the files contain damning emails, memos, interviews, drawings, testimonies, AV transcriptions, notes, lists, death lists, and fun graphics that make you turn the book in circles so you can read what it says and make your family question what the hell you are reading. The blacked-out swear words in the files make it that much more fun because you can fill in the blanks with your own creative profanities.

The collected contents of these files are broken into three stories all related to the invasion. Each book has it's own set of main characters that are interconnected with one another and with them all coming together in the end to tie the story with a neat little bow.

Each set of main characters has a love you/can't stand you/get away from me/come back/I need you evolution of a relationship. My favorite couple is definitely Kady and Ezra from the first book. Hanna and Nik from Gemina and Asha and Rhys from Obsidio are excellent creations but my heart belongs to Kady and Ezra. Speaking of my heart, did I mention this series has the weirdest love triangle I have ever read? Usually I hate love triangles but this one, this one is iconic.

I was intrigued from the first page, the first email in Illuminae, but it was the following pages of Kady and Ezra's interview that had me hooked and I was in it for the long haul. From the invasion of the mining colony to the escape into outer space in Illuminae, to the invasion of the jump station to the invasion of slimy weird things in Gemina, to the return to the mining colony to the final battle to the courtroom in Obsidio, every page is different and exciting. The stories never stagnate and the characters are unique unto themselves. But one of the best characters, the most complex, the most memorable is an Artificial Intelligence named AIDAN.

So, these two fantastic literary geniuses wrote a story about an evil corporation that attacked a mining colony and it might have been written before but like I said: Not like this.

Note: the death lists in these books are rather popular as you might recognize some names and the writers even had contests so readers could be on a death list. (I entered but wasn't chosen.)

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001).

30349,4026,630,"It can be refreshing to note that a rewarding novel does not need to be particularly literary, unpredictable or even plausible to be thoroughly enjoyable.  Reading the Last Mrs. Parrish, cowritten by two sisters under the pen name Liv Constantine, is an example of such an experience.  The characters are exaggerated archetypes: pure evil and plucky goodness pitted against each other set within the backdrop of luxurious wealth and glamour.  The novel is divided into three parts, the first is presented in the third person (omniscient) and focuses on the wicked Amber Patterson, a grifter who feels entitled to the riches and privileges denied her by birth.  She readily admits her intentions from the beginning-to lie, seduce and manipulate her way in to infiltrate that world she envies. Amber sees Daphne Parrish as an easy mark; a woman who is pitifully trusting and nave, desperately trying to find someone to mentor as a replacement for her deceased sister.  Amber, a true sociopath, feels no remorse as she plots to replace Daphne as the wife of the superrich Jackson Parrish. The second part switches to the first-person point of view of Daphne, who then relates her side of the story as it unfolds. Typical of stories of this type, there are plenty of twists and surprises for the characters as well as for the reader.  The final section reverts to third person again, bringing the two women into clear focus and resolving the drama in a very satisfying way. A healthy suspension of disbelief and a respect for pulpy page-turners would be a good way to approach (and fully appreciate) this guilty pleasure of a novel.",1521158400,4,refresh note reward novel need particularli literari unpredict even plausibl thoroughli enjoy read last mr parrish cowritten two sister pen name liv constantin exampl experi charact exagger archetyp pure evil plucki good pit set within backdrop luxuri wealth glamour novel divid three part first present third person omnisci focus wick amber patterson grifter feel entitl rich privileg deni birth readili admit intent beginningto lie seduc manipul way infiltr world envi amber see daphn parrish easi mark woman piti trust nave desper tri find someon mentor replac deceas sister amber true sociopath feel remors plot replac daphn wife superrich jackson parrish second part switch firstperson point view daphn relat side stori unfold typic stori type plenti twist surpris charact well reader final section revert third person bring two woman clear focu resolv drama satisfi way healthi suspens disbelief respect pulpi pageturn would good way approach fulli appreci guilti pleasur novel

30355,3061,3503,"This book was a pleasant book to read. It was interesting and moved well. I certainly got the feeling of what life on an aircraft carrier and in the war during that period was like.  However, it was somehow incomplete.
 It turned out to focus rather heavily on the battle of Midway.  This was not really what the book was supposed to be about. It was supposed to be about the whole pacific experience in the early war. I have read several of the books on the battle of Midway, which I confess I still do not fully understand.  This book explained it rather more poorly than other books I have read on this.  What exactly was the battle of Midway? Why did the Japanese feel it was so important? Why did we feel it was so important. Why exactly did we win?  Apparently the Japanese were more experienced at this point in the war, and their Zero  fighters were superior and more maneuverable than ours.  Did we win because we destroyed all the airplanes? Did we win because we destroyed their aircraft carriers?  I recall there was some question of one of the Japanese admirals warming his planes with anti-land bombs rather than anti-ship torpedoes, and this was one of the reasons why we won. This was not really addressed in this book.  Why did we have such overwhelming victory in the face of what appeared to be Japanese superior forces and skills?  This was apparently one of the decisive battles in World War II, which effectively ended Japanese superiority.  After reading this book, I still do not understand exactly why this is true, what happened, or how we did it.

30356,1522,3891,"This compelling book tells the story of a young man who suddenly chose to rack up quite a body count -- 5 men (6, if you count his suicide) in five different cities in just four months. Andrew Cunanan's story captures and holds our interest because he's not typical. He's not a Charles Manson. He's not a loner -- I don't think he could stand being alone. He's bright and had an easy time making (if not keeping) friends. He had natural gifts: intellect, looks, imagination, and a photographic memory. And yet, his life went spectacularly off the rails and he destroyed five very nice men on the way down.

It's also an exhaustive and brutal look at  law enforcement in post-OJ America. The last two murders may not have happened if the authorities had been more coordinated and focused in their handling of the first three.

While highly readable, it's a far from perfect book. Orth is very hard on those who exploit Andrew's tragedy, all the while reminding us that she was first on the story, even before he murdered Versace. She wants it both ways: she wants to use this sensational story to enhance her career while sitting in judgement of others who profit from it.

And the book is ultimately frustrating because there's no real explanation as to why he did all this. Until he went on his murderous spree, there is no real evidence that Andrew had a penchant for violence. Orth breathlessly keeps returning to his fondness for porn and drugs. Even in the pre-internet 1990s, porn was easily accessible. So were drugs. And yet somehow, South Beach wasn't crawling with serial killers.

There was one passage that stayed with me, that went further toward an explanation than any of her tsk-tsk-ing about gay porn and tweaking. His killing spree may have begun because his life of lies was about to be exposed. "" ... the two men that he cared for most (Jeff and David) were turning their backs on him, banishing him to struggle alone, insecure, depressed and overweight. It was all their fault. They were forcing him to expose the sham of his grandiosity like a mangy peacock.""

He had no faith, no sense of values, no sense of self. All Andrew Cunanan had was grandiosity. Perhaps that final, pitiless exposure was simply too painful for him to bear.",1521158400,4,compel book tell stori young man suddenli chose rack quit bodi count 5 men 6 count suicid five differ citi four month andrew cunanan stori captur hold interest he typic he charl manson he loner dont think could stand alon he bright easi time make keep friend natur gift intellect look imagin photograph memori yet life went spectacularli rail destroy five nice men way also exhaust brutal look law enforc postoj america last two murder may happen author coordin focus handl first three highli readabl far perfect book orth hard exploit andrew tragedi remind u first stori even murder versac want way want use sensat stori enhanc career sit judgement other profit book ultim frustrat there real explan went murder spree real evid andrew penchant violenc orth breathlessli keep return fond porn drug even preinternet 1990 porn easili access drug yet somehow south beach wasnt crawl serial killer one passag stay went toward explan tsktsking gay porn

30360,3077,87,"I had enjoyed Backman's ""A Man Called Ove"". I did not like Britt-Marie was here, but took a chance on Beartown partly because of the subject (hockey) and partly on a strong rec from a friend. Well, I'm glad I did! This novel eventually drew me into its world in a way that rarely happens. This takes place in a rural part of a Scandinavia. They never specify the country, and it is written so that one can easily see it as occurring in rural Canada, or maybe Minnesota or North Dakota. Until ""kroner"" was mentioned, I was thinking this could be in North America. I guess it shows how similar a hockey culture can be in different countries. The first half of this book focuses on the game of hockey (a great game) and the hockey/jock culture (not a good thing) in this hockey crazy town. The ""boys will be boys"" mentality and star idolization result in an act of violence that rips this community apart. I really liked this novel, in spite of its flaws. The biggest flaw was the fact that little happened over the first half of the book, The fact that I love hockey kept me interested enough. After initial confusion with so many characters, I finally got to know them all, and care about the people and this small town. An underdog junior team is vying for a national championship when a violent act turns things upside down. Heroism and bad behavior by adults and kids fill this fascinating novel.

Plot of the book  teenagers competing to be part of a six person team to find a liveable planet for Earthens (that is us!) And thats the only the thing you need to know about the plot before going into the book  it is an experience you wanna try out for yourself; trust me!!

The characters are brilliantly created; diverse in nature and as a reader, I loved that and I had such a pleasurable time getting glimpses of their culture and traditions in such a controlled environment.

There is drama duh! Teenagers together, with all those raging hormones competing and thats the best part of the book. Theres romance brewing and everything had me cackling like a witch planning revenge (my hubbys words, not mine *rolls eyes*).

30382,1048,894,"As a science fiction aficionado, you often find yourself mired in unrelentingly depressing apocalyptic plots, interstellar tales of inter-species genocide, and endless narratives about human technological hubris going awry.  The bulk of the better written and well-plotted SF novels, the ones with big ideas and unique points of view, often explore the darker side of advancement and discovery.  But every story need not plumb the depths of human (or alien) folly, and every novel need not be ground-breaking or award-winning.

Becky Chambers in this first of a series has instead chosen to write in the best tradition of Star Trek--optimistic, strength through diversity and understanding, and humorous.  The analogy bears out in that there is not one main and overarching story line, but rather what feels a bit more episodic with a handful of smaller climaxes that act to introduce us to the crew of the Wayfarer and the universe they exist in.  The captain and about half of the crew is human, but there are also three alien crew members and an AI.  The book opens with Rosemary, the newest member of the crew, on her way to rendezvous with the Wayfarer.  All we know is that she isn't entirely what she seems and that she is trying to escape her past.  As we progress in the book Chambers does an excellent job of fleshing out the crew with insights into their histories and personalities, and uses this as as springboard to also help us explore the Galactic Commons which many sapient races belong to.

While this is not a book that belabors ideas over character and story, Chambers still weaves in serious subjects.  There are discussions related to inter-species romance, respecting the customs of others, the rights of clones and AI, family and belonging, and friendship.  With that, there is action (though not overblown), romance, and hints at galactic political intrigue.  This book makes you wish for crew like that of the Wayfarers' and I look forward to the other books in the series (currently two published, a third due out this summer).",1521244800,5,scienc fiction aficionado often find mire unrelentingli depress apocalypt plot interstellar tale interspeci genocid endless narr human technolog hubri go awri bulk better written wellplot sf novel one big idea uniqu point view often explor darker side advanc discoveri everi stori need plumb depth human alien folli everi novel need groundbreak awardwin becki chamber first seri instead chosen write best tradit star trekoptimist strength diver understand humor analog bear one main overarch stori line rather feel bit episod hand smaller climax act introduc u crew wayfar univers exist captain half crew human also three alien crew member ai book open rosemari newest member crew way rendezv wayfar know isnt entir seem tri escap past progress book chamber excel job flesh crew insight histori person use springboard also help u explor galact common mani sapient race belong book belabor idea charact stori chamber still weav seriou subject discus relat interspeci romanc respect custom other right clone ai famili belong friendship

Secrets, lies, blackmail, murder, and revenge all factor into this gripping tale. The story is narrated from several points of view, but without it getting too confusing.

As for Portia herself, she has struck me, thus far, as being a little flaky, only acting in her own self-interest more often than not even while proclaiming a deep friendship with Naledi.  Of course, Naledi extracted a promise from Portia near the end of this story to change her ways.  So let's hope a change for the better is in the works and will stick.
As for Thabiso, he seemed very full of himself in the beginning of the book, although that must be a prerequisite of all royalty.  But this was explained because he was uncertain of what Naledi knew of him, her background, and why her parents up and left Thesolo when he was a mere toddler.  The romantic relationship that developed between him and Naledi grew from his curiosity about her in the present day, exploding eventually into a love that could not be denied by the end of the story.  And they eventually figure out why her parents departed, stealing her away from him.  Although I won't divulge that secret here.
The only thing I would have liked to have seen was Naledi speaking with her maternal grandparents after they woke up from their disease-ridden comas, just to give Naledi a better sense of closure in her life.  But other than that, I had fun reading this book and can't wait to read of her and Thabiso's further adventures.  Even if they'll be delegated to background character status since Portia and some Scottish blacksmith are on tap next.",1521244800,5,like chemistri naledi thabiso instantli fall love also bonu like watch think work around root feel one anoth also secondari charact given enough depth make seem like wellround figur alongsid main charact speak want learn kelli portia sister sen interest background way ill get wish next book also got definit sen portia arent close way twin suppos portia struck thu far littl flaki act selfinterest often even proclaim deep friendship naledi cours naledi extract promis portia near end stori chang way let hope chang better work stick thabiso seem full begin book although must prerequisit royalti explain uncertain naledi knew background parent left thesolo mere toddler romant relationship develop naledi grew curio present day explod eventu love could deni end stori eventu figur parent depart steal away although wont divulg secret thing would like seen naledi speak matern grandpar

30400,3175,2769,"Summary:

   A recluse with agoraphobia, Anna Fox spends her days watching old movies, drinking way too much, and spying on her neighbors. When the perfect family moves across the park, she can't look away. A father, mother and teen son; the Russells seem to have it all. One night, though, Anna sees something that she shouldn't... and it all unravels. Misdirection, lies and deceit... she knows what she saw... or does she? Is it possible too much wine and too many pills combined with old movies have created a crazy scenario? How can she know- and who can she go to for help? Is anyone else- is she- in danger? And who is pulling the strings here?

My thoughts:

   I loved this book for a lot of reasons. Every time I felt like I knew where things were going, the story veered off leading me to somewhere new. I had an inkling a few times about what was going on, but I didn't want to believe it. There were so many scenarios that could have fit! The character development was amazing. Even the characters I hated, like Anna and David, were intensely interesting and wonderfully multi-faceted. I felt for Anna, having been a psychologist she wanted so badly to help others, to heal others even as she could not heal herself that she often went too far and did too much out of desire to be of assistance. I also felt that her trauma and pain were well done. For me, this was a four and a half star book, with an extra star for originality.
      On the adult content scale, there is a high level of violence, language, and some sexual content. This is definitely geared toward adults.

30401,2826,3780,"Catherie Nixey's book, The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World, studies what St. Augustine called merciful savagery, the destruction of classical philosophy by the Christians who inherited the Roman Empire. The book is a compelling narrative, full of facts, and an antidote to two thousand years of Christian propaganda about how one culture replaced the other.

It's not the particular beliefs the Christians espoused, or the nature of monotheism as opposed to polytheism that made the Christians a threat to freedom of thought, it was the intolerance they showed to any other religion.

It's a common belief in modern societies that the pagan Romans persecuted the Christian martyrs. Catherine Nixey shows it's not that simple.

The author analyzes at length correspondence between Pliny the Younger and the emperor Trajan about the way to deal with recalcitrant Christians. The emperor was willing to give Christians any excuse to practice their religion as long as they didn't simply refuse to acknowledge the authority of the state. The author quotes Trajan: Conquirendi non sunt. These people must not be hunted out.

It's ironic that barely a generation later it would be Christian Roman officials who would be investigating the thoughts and religious practices of citizens.

Some of the martyrs were would-be suicides, itinerant farm workers called circumcellions.

In AD 392 clerics in Alexandria destroyed what was considered the most beautiful  building on earththe temple of Serapis, a god that linked Egypt to Rome, thereby typifying one of the strengths of polytheism. Besides the temple, books in the Great Library were also destroyed.

Nixey analyzes the main reasons that historians have given over the centuries for why Christianity replaced the old religion.

Polytheism was just ridiculous, goes one version.

Of course people didn't believe that stories about Zeus's adultery and Hera's jealousy were true, but doesn't that make the old culture more sophisticated instead of less? People recognized that the meaning of Greco-Roman mythology wasn't literal. That's why Albert Camus was able to use the myth of Sisyphus to illustrate a philosophical idea millennia after the gods first appeared.

Another theory about why the empire changed from one religion to another is that people were living through an anxious time. The barbarians were at the gates, and Christianity unified the empire.

Statistics make Catherine Nixey doubt this, though. She estimates less than ten percent of the empire's population were Christian when Constantine declared Rome a Christian empire. That left fifty million to be converted.

But the church wrote the histories, and therefore Christ's victory was inevitable. However, history is never inevitable.

By the late 400s monks came out of the desert to destroy what temples were left, such as the one dedicated to Caelestis in Carthage. The Christians were proud of the destruction they committed, and of the conversions that resulted from the violence. Non-Christians pointed out that these were not true conversions, but the Christians didn't care.

In the year 415, Hypatia, a philosopher in Alexandria who taught and tried to learn from everyone, including Christians, was taken by a Christian mob who flayed her alive, gouged out her eyes, and then burned her.

Nixey blames the disappearance of most Greek and Roman literature as much on simple ignorance as on conscious actions. For instance, St. Antony was proud that he never learned to read.

The author points out that only about one percent of Latin literature has been saved. The monks who get credit for recopying classical literature often ignored rare ancient texts and made unnecessary copies of Christian authors.

You could make a martyrology of philosophers whose actions, not just words, put them in danger.

Nixey tells the story of the philosopher Damascius, who escaped the Christian mobs in Alexandria after Hypatia's murder and returned to Athens.

For a while, Athens was relatively safe for philosophers. Damascius became the head of the Academy, the school that had seen Plato and other brilliant minds of the ancient world. But by this time Christianity was entrenched in the empire. A law against teaching pagan philosophies under penalty of death drove the seven remaining Academicians briefly to Persia, but life there was no better.

They returned to the empire. Their former refuge in Athens had been turned over to Christians who beheaded the statue of Athena, the goddess of wisdom, to show the primacy faith over reason.

It would be centuries until man was again the measure of all things.

Mindi wanted to try for an arranged marriage to stay with tradition and Nikki didn't know what exactly she wanted to do, but it was not an arranged marriage.

30410,2006,3489,"Alex Delaware, a psychiatrist, was frequently called upon by Los Angeles homicide detective Milo Sturgis to assist in solving especially gruesome and thorny murders.  In NIGHT MOVES, he was called to a house where the family came home from dinner and discovered the mutilated body of a man in the fathers den/office.  While there were no signs of a struggle or even the expected blood splatters, the mans face was unrecognizable and his hands had been amputated.  Identification would, therefore, be very difficult.  A major question was why was the body in that location?
 As Alex joined in the interviews with the family membersfather, mother, seventeen-year-old daughter, and thirteen-year-old sonhe quickly determined that their family dynamics were very strange and hostile.  The father paid no attention to the children while the mother refused to let the police talk to them.  The childrens bickering went beyond that seen in a normal family.
 The houses in the neighborhood were expensive and the people were not at all friendly with each other.  As he talked with some of them to find out what they might have seen, a few mentioned one of the residents was unusually strange.  He was a famous cartoonist whose cartoons were on the twisted side and he did not talk to any of the neighbors, even refusing to acknowledge their friendly greetings.  He would not answer the door when the police first came to his house and later refused to talk to them.
 As the story progressed, there are other murders and Alex and Milo tried valiantly to find a link between them.  The hunt for both the identity of the first victim as well as finding the killer or killers took them to several areas of southern California.  The story had as many twists as did the roads they traveled to reach them.
 NIGHT MOVES was a fast read though it did drag a bit in the middle.  The last quarter of the book made up for that as more characters are introduced and some people prove to not be who Alex and Milo thought they were.
 Once again, Jonathan Kellerman proves that it is possible to write an excellent crime novel without including descriptive sexuality or crude language.

30411,617,2037,"This is another book from my blogger shame pile. I actually started and stopped it a few times before deciding to try it in audio on my drive east not long ago. I have been wanting to try Kathy Reichs for a while as I really enjoy Bones, the television adaptation of the Temperance Brennan series.

Sunday Night is a tortured heroine, former military, former law enforcement, current recluse and part-time private investigator. Sunday suffers from PTSD, slight hallucinations/delusions, and fairly extreme paranoia. Though her paranoia does seem to serve her well in her line of work. Sunday is convinced (somewhat guilted) into taking a case involving a missing girl and bombing, and the investigation will see her traversing the country from Charleston to California to Kentucky. I was not able to connect to Sunday Night - I just couldn't get a bead on her character. She was part film noir, part snark - but those characteristics largely fell flat in the audio version of this book. She also seemed somewhat inept in her role as a private investigator, and I often found myself rolling my eyes or feeling like she was missing the picture completely.

The mystery and suspense was fairly well laid out. I liked the plot line and there were some good twists in there. Unfortunately, I just couldn't get myself interested into the story enough to care. I even fell asleep during one rather important moment once I got to my hotel room, and I wasn't interested enough to rewind and see what happened.

While this story did not work for me, I still plan to give the Temperance Brennan series a shot. I think I may be able to connect to her quirky character better than this noir snark.

30416,132,39,"""Annihilation"" seems to be the ""buzzy"" sci-fi novel of the moment, one that everyone is clamoring to read.  The premise looked interesting, but I normally shy away from the hyped ""it"" book of the moment until some of the fuss has died down.  But when I learned a movie based on this book was coming out, I figured I should at least read the novel before watching the film.  And... not only do I not see what the fuss is about, nor how anyone could look at this book and consider it movie material, but I can honestly say that I hated it.  Some interesting concepts were completely ruined for me by confusing and pretentious prose, a complete lack of characterization, and a seeming unwillingness by the author to actually explain what the heck is going on.

""Annihilation"" takes place in Area X, an area where some sort of strange event has wiped out the people living there and is slowly turning everything into lush wilderness.  Most of the expeditions sent to explore Area X and determine what happened have had catastrophe of some sort fall upon them, and the current expedition -- four women, known only as the psychologist, the surveyor, the anthropologist, and the biologist (our narrator) -- sets out in an effort to succeed where the others have failed.  The biologist immediately begins to suspect that the psychologist knows more than she's letting on, and that she's hypnotizing the team members for sinister purposes.  But Area X is affecting everyone, including the biologist, in ways they cannot fathom... and it turns out the biologist herself has her own secret ties to Area X, and her own reasons for determining just what happened here...

I was excited to dive into this book and figure out what was going on -- alien invasion?  Science or military experiment run amok?  Gaia's revenge?  Lovecraftian horror?  Don't expect any definitive answers if you do choose to read this -- the novel seems to deliberately go out of its way to not give a definite answer to anything.  Not to the larger mystery of Area X, not to what makes the characters act the way they do... nothing.  Things are hinted at, such as the ""moaning monster"" that stalks the campsite or the large reptilian creatures said to lurk here or a mysterious Tower (really a gigantic tunnel, but the biologist insists in calling it a Tower for some weird reason), but no answers are provided in the book.  I understand that this is the first volume in a trilogy, but come on, the reader expects SOME answers, SOME resolution, even from the first book in a series.

I could have forgiven the vagueness of everything happening had the characters been at all interesting... but no effort is made to make any of the characters relatable or to flesh out their characters.  The biologist gets some hints of characterization, as we do learn her backstory, some of her personality, and her motivation for coming to Area X... but the other characters might as well be robots for all the personality and characterization they get.  Perhaps this was intentional on the author's part to focus the reader's attention on the biologist or to render them unlikable, but it was a stupid tactic on his part... and the biologist herself was so aloof and erratic that I couldn't bring myself to root for her as I read.

Jeff VanderMeer's writing is pretty inconsistent as well.  There are some lovely descriptive bits, but the book alternates between good writing and wooden, stiff prose, often in the middle of a section.  And there are times when the description, instead of proving a clearer picture of what's going on, just serves to confuse the reader.

I honestly can't understand why anyone chose to make a movie out of this -- there's hardly anything here to make a decent film, especially when it seems to deliberately go out of its way to avoid answering any questions the reader might have.  And while I know this is part of a trilogy and some answers need to be saved for future books, baiting the reader into buying the next book by refusing to resolve anything in the current book is a huge cheat in my opinion.  I won't be continuing this series, and unless I hear from a reputable source that the film manages to construct something actually decent out of this bare-bones novel, I probably won't be watching it either.",1521244800,1,annihil seem buzzi scifi novel moment one everyon clamor read premis look interest normal shi away hype book moment fuss die learn movi base book come figur least read novel watch film see fuss anyon could look book consid movi materi honestli say hate interest concept complet ruin confus pretenti prose complet lack character seem unwilling author actual explain heck go annihil take place area x area sort strang event wipe peopl live slowli turn everyth lush wilder expedit sent explor area x determin happen catastroph sort fall upon current expedit four woman known psychologist surveyor anthropologist biologist narrat set effort succeed other fail biologist immedi begin suspect psychologist know she let she hypnot team member sinist purpos area x affect everyon includ biologist way cannot fathom turn biologist secret tie area x reason determin happen excit dive book figur go alien

30419,235,3822,"The hardcover of this book, due for release in early march, shows a horse drawn wagon heading out into uncharted territory. This represented the pioneering spirit of American settlers heading west for California who felt confident in the knowledge that they were destined to occupy this territory irrespective of the affect their actions might have on the indigenous native American tribes who already populated these regions. The Hunger recalls one particular group of travellers historically referred to as the ""Donner Party"", led by Jacob and George Donner, who in the spring of 1846 departed Springfield Illinois on a perilous 2500 mile journey their intended destination the Mexican province of alta California. Poor planning, bad decision and snowstorms caused a number of the original pioneers to become trapped in the mountains during the severe winter of 1846. When food ran out it was said that they resorted to cannibalism; the unthinkable had happened in order to survive.

Alma Katsu expertly uses the harsh unforgiving environment and that deep rooted human weakness, fear of darkness and the unknown, to instil in the travellers a paranoia that something evil is out there stalking them.....""He saw teeth sharpened like iron nails, and too many of them, far too many-a long slick of throat, like a dark tunnel, and that horrible tongue slapping like a blind animal feeling for it prey.""...Some excellent characterization really made the story come alive as long held dark secrets gradually emerged. James Reed owner of a large furniture business in Springfield, married to an older woman, yet tortured inwardly by personal feelings, dark thoughts and undisclosed encounters. Charles Stanton, the quiet anti-hero whom Mary Graves....""was giddily, stupidly, happily in love."".....Tamsen Donner, young bride to George Donner, her beauty and wayward ways causing discern and rumour amongst the gradually starving disillusioned pioneers. As bad weather, low rations, and poor decisions prevailed the.... ""creatures that fed on human flesh"".....selected and noisily consumed the weak and innocent.

What I loved about this novel was the seamless blending of historical facts with a modern horror theme, a wolf like predator with an unquenchable longing for human flesh. As a British reader I must confess to my ignorance of the Donner Party and was pleased that the author included an ""historical note"" which greatly added to my enjoyment of the overall story. There were many fine observations in this ill fated journey non better than a quote at the conclusion of chapter 21.....""Then the Lord must be mightily displeased with you, because he has led you into the valley of death. Make peace with your Lord before it is too late, because the hungry ones are coming for you.""....

30424,1613,143,"Ruth is a labor and delivery nurse (she has been for 20 years). One day she goes in to do a new Mother and Infant check and the parents are not too friendly, in fact, they are hostile. The exam ends when the father tells her to get away from his wife. He then goes on to tell Ruth's supervisor that no African American hospital staff are to touch his son. A post it note is put in the chart and Ruth is made aware of this as she is the only African American working in the Labor and delivery department. The parents are white supremacists. Ruth is upset but agrees to comply.

The next day Ruth is left alone in a room with the baby after he is circumcised and the baby goes into distress. What is Ruth to do. There is a note in the chart saying no African Americans are to touch the baby, but the baby needs medical help. She has taken the Oath a nurse takes. Does she listen to her supervisor and the note, does she act? What is the woman supposed to do. What is right and what is wrong. Her supervisor comes in and tells her to act, she performs CPR but unfortunately that baby dies.

Ruth is charged with Murder. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't comes to mind for this circumstance. She is arrested along with her teenage son by police who enter her home at 3 a.m. She is represented the next day by a white female public defender named Kennedy who advises Ruth that race has no room in the court room. It is not a winning strategy.

For Ruth, race has everything to do with her arrest and the charges against her. We see how people react to her. Ruth goes to the cafeteria to get something for her self and staff asks her if she needs help while at the same time pulling her purse closer to herself. We see Ruth followed closely while shopping for a present. She is approached several times and upon leaving the store, her receipt and bag are checked.

The story progresses and we see who Ruth and Kennedy begin to trust each other and let the other one in. I thought it was a great learning experience for both of them but mainly for Kennedy.

Race is a big subject to take on. I thought that Picoult did a very good job with it. At least in my mind she did. She showed us several families. The white supremacists, Ruth, her son and her sister, and Kennedy's family. I thought she did a good job with those. She was able to show how characters so full of hate could also be full of love. That is a tricky thing but it is real. How a person can love their child, their spouse yet hate others so deeply. She also showed how people don't want to be seen as racists and how people don't either see or want to acknowledge there is a problem because the problem does not affect them.

Ruth's trial begins and I thought Picoult did the courtroom scenes very well. Character dynamics, relationships, fear, loss, regret, wanting to have your say, to tell the truth, to have justice, revenge all come into play.

There is a reveal at the end of the book that was interesting and I did not see coming.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I think this is a perfect book for book clubs. Lots of great discussions can be had.

  For Kate Channing, Severine was an unwelcome presence, her inscrutable beauty undermining the close-knit groups loyalties amid the already simmering tensions. And after a huge altercation on the last night of the holiday, Kate knew nothing would ever be the same. There are some things you cant forgive. And there are some people you cant forgetlike Severine, who was never seen again.

  Now, a decade later, the case is reopened when Severines body is found in the well behind the farmhouse. Questioned along with her friends, Kate stands to lose everything shes worked so hard to achieve as suspicion mounts around her. Desperate to resolve her own shifting memories and fearful she will be forever bound to the woman whose presence still haunts her, Kate finds herself buried under layers of deception with no one to set her free

Can she figure out the truth of what happened? Or will she finally realize that her memories have been hidden from her for a reason?

There were many characters to loathe, like Caro, whose presence in Kates life these days is an annoying and disturbing reminder of those feelings.

What about Tom, who seems to know more than he is letting on? And then there is Lara, her best friend, who might be hiding something, too.

30438,1613,3547,"""I think at some point, dear, you're going to have to work out who Louisa Clark is.""

I don't think there needed to be a trilogy. I really don't. Let me start by saying I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED Me Before you. It literally blew me away. I read it twice and have seen the movie three times. I think it is Moyes Swan song. It doesn't get any better than that - which is why the two books which followed could not live up to their predecessor.

In this book we see our much-loved Louisa Clarke moving to New York City to be the ""assistant"" to a wealthy young socialite. A socialite who is not much liked by others in her social circles as her husband was once married to their friend. A friend he divorced to marry his much younger massage therapist. Before she is even over her jet lag, Louisa is running in central park, shopping and attending fancy social events. She is thrown into a glamorous life one that is much different from the life she lived in England with her paramedic boyfriend, Sam.

While out and about she meets a man named Josh Ryan who bears a striking resemblance to someone from her past. They form a friendship while Louisa pines for Sam and throws herself into the NYC high society social circle. Louisa continues to be quirky and finds herself in various situations both comedic and sad. There will be misunderstandings, new friends, broken hearts, miscommunication, deceit and mayhem.

In this book, Louisa takes Will's advice from Me Before you: You only get one life. It's actually your duty to live it as fully as possible. She does take chances and tries to be her own person but sadly, it didn't really pay off for me in this book. It was a solid 3-star book for me. I hoped it would be better. I can't fault he writing, the writing is good but the story lagged in places for me. Again, I think she should have left well enough alone. Good not great.

30439,633,3350,"I have read Quidditch Through the Ages a few times over the years since the book was first released. Listening to the audiobook was a real treat!

This audiobook was so much fun to listen to! Andrew Lincoln did an absolutely amazing job! I really loved the various voices and accents he used to capture all of the characters mentioned. There were also sound effects used here and there such as crowd cheering, the snitch noise as it zooms around, horns, and other such things, that added a lovely layer to the production.

There were many terms, names and such things that I heard out loud for the first time. So of course that was interesting!

All of the bonus elements were fun as well!

There was The History of the Quidditch World Cup which dove a bit deeper into famous Quidditch games through the years. I was so excited to hear about Viktor Krum and a few of his famous matches!

There were also a bunch of lovely articles from the Daily Prophet that were included that were also wonderful to listen to! I loved the way that Imogen Church read these as she acted like Ginny Potter! She put some wonderful emotion into the readings. Though I have to admit, I was a bit bummed to hear when Rita Skeeter came in, narrated by Annette Badland. Mention of Rita's name still gives me anxiety! But of course the narrator that read these articles did a great job here as well. And it was fun to hear about Harry and the crew. Though Rita's creepily obsessive narrative about Harry and her negativity toward the other characters made me very weary.

30445,1574,3717,"I knew going into this book that I was not in the sweet spot of its target audience, but the further along in the story I got, the less it mattered. In Women in Sunlight, author Frances Mayer returns to her beloved Tuscany. Not a sequel to Under the Tuscan Sun, Women in Sunlight is wholly separate, a work of fiction  though not without some connections and similarities to the earlier memoir.

Kit Raines is a writer  poet and novelist  who lives in the (fictional) Tuscan town of San Rocco, in a small villa which she shares with her significant other (I hesitate to use boyfriend when the subject is in his 40s), an architect named Colin who travels back and forth between Italy and his firms London offices. One October morning three 60-ish American women show up at the house next door, which is being leased out by the daughter of Kits recently deceased neighbors. The trio of aging southern belles  widows Susan and Camille. and Julia, a refugee from a bad marriage  throw themselves into their year of Tuscan living with gusto, learning to speak Italian, refurbishing the aged stone farmhouse and garden, and rediscovering the passions and interests of their youth  art, cooking, gardening  all with the added brio that seems to come with the territory in Italy.

The book is delightful escapism. Everyone seems to have plenty of money, and little in the way of illness or misfortune (there is one unfortunate occurrence, which I will not go into because it would constitute a spoiler of sorts, but its inclusion seems almost gratuitous.) There were times when I verged on dismissal of the almost relentlessly sunny outlook the story espouses, but it was so infectious that I found myself suppressing my inner Grinch and just enjoying the ride.

Even if one were to adopt something of a cynical attitude toward the story, the language will keep you engaged. Ms Mayer has a gift for an elegant turn of phrase, and her love for the countryside, people, cuisine, and culture of not only Tuscany, but all of Italy, informs her prose. She does use an oddly worded (to my mind) expression or two, here and there (which I would be discussing with her were I the editor for the book), but nothing terribly intrusive (though I did make a few notes in my copy with my red editors pencil.)

30449,2202,3830,"My Highly Caffeinated Thought: An emotional and slow revealing thriller filled with twists and wonderfully imperfect characters. Not to mention an ending which can be called nothing short of killer.

Claire Mackintosh did it again! LET ME LIE brings together so many elements of the authors previous books while infusing it with a whole new theme. The blending of social issues, mental stability, and addiction with the mystery of what happened to Annas parents was expertly done.

As a slow-burning psychological thriller, this book eases the reader into the investigation. Though at times I wanted the pace to be a bit quicker, the author would throw in tidbits and reveals to keep my interest. In truth the complexity and nature the story allows for the pace. I was able to grasp more of the content as well as delve further into the web of lies, secrets, and duplicity of the characters.

This is the third book I have read by the author, and I must say that I was not disappointed. I love her deeply flawed characters. Mackintosh always manages to bring to life the honesty and grit of the human condition. There is never anything cut and dry with her books.

30450,125,3894,"I am coming to love this series and Hopjoy Was Here, the third, is another good one.  This time Purbright and his team investigate a possible acid-bath murder, as agents of National Security hover because one of their own may be the victim.  It's a well told, quite twisty tale, but as always it is Colin Watson's writing which is the really enjoyable thing.

Watson has a dry, sardonic take on things, illustrated by this lovely little example as Purbright calls to interview a neighbour of the house which is the crime scene: ""Mrs Alice Sayers celebrated the installation of a police inspector in her drawing-room by serving a jug of hot milk and water delicately tinctured with coffee essence...""  The book is full of such amusing and penetrating little nuggets of characterisation, including a very enjoyable satire of self-important spies, while the plot moves on at a fairly leisurely pace - which is just fine by me.

My sole reservation is that women are treated with almost universal contempt, and there are some observations about their sexuality among other things which border on the offensive.  Even allowing for the prevailing attitudes of the period, I did find this uncomfortable.  However, there is so much else to enjoy here that I can still warmly recommend the book.

30451,2274,3830,"Claire Mackintosh is one of my favorite crime writers. Her characters are vivid, her plots brilliant, and the mystery intriguing. However, Let Me Lie was much more of a family drama than her previous two books, which gave it a bit of a different feeling. There was much more of a focus on mother-daughter dynamics and family secrets. It wasn't as suspenseful as I was expecting but it was still an engrossing read. While this wasn't my favorite book of hers, I still adore her as a writer and will absolutely be reading everything she writes in the future. If you're a reader who found her previous novels, which were more psychological thrillers, to be too dark, I think this is the Clare Mackintosh book for you!

30461,3949,3486,"I see this book is doing well, and in my opinion it is amazing.  I tear up at the end of a well-written book; especially when it has so much heart, and makes so much sense.

I'll first say that the title misled me, and that I expected more of a fluff piece; so happy this is quite a substantial read.  I have long sensed over the years, much of what Author, Benjamin Hardy asserts is true, so I can say that for me it all rings true.  The notion that our environment can be what shapes us, versus the notion that we as individuals grow and change from our own efforts alone, not taking our environment into consideration. This is one of the points the author makes.  He was not referring to our inner environment at that time as I recall.

Willpower does factor into this of course, but in my mind it appears that this book is only saying that it willpower is like wheels turning, propelling us. I think the author points out that we can do better, and wow, he sure does make that point well throughout the book.  My understanding is that we need much more than these wheels (my own interpretation of willpower) to accomplish what we want.  And personally, I don't think of this as a book about willpower, as much as a book is giving extensive, and heartfelt guidance on how to manage your life, your time, your creativity, and more.

Putting ourselves in different, new, creative, and more conducive environments, is the cornerstone of much of this book, yet, by the time I got to the end, I felt as though I had read about brilliant life-lessons that frankly made me feel much better about myself.  For years, I have heard people regurgitate what I would consider ""junk psychology"", particularly when my siblings and I were young and foolish.  I remember at one point I was informed that my life was a result of my own choices, that it was that simple.  The assumption was that since I had grown up with the same chances as others, I should have chosen better ones to have had a result similar to theirs. That notion disagreed with my logic, since I did not believe it was that simple.  I don't know if anyone, nor if the the author, would say that statement I just made is true, but the important thing is that after reading certain passages in this book I've felt as though I have been exonerated.  Ahh, how nice to be older and wiser now, and to read someone who is quite a bit more wise than I; though this author is much younger.

Benjamin Hardy writes about how his choice of having chosen a fostered family has influenced his life learning, and the way he approaches life.  While reading this book, it seemed to me that he was conveying that this new adventure gave him the impetus to grow, at perhaps a more rapid rate, or perhaps he would say that he learned, adapted, and had grown, more, and deeper as a result.  The way he put this really resonated with me, because it brought me around to thinking, that if I had not had a son, and then had become a single parent, where would that impetus have come from which propelled me forward to overcome the odds I did in my life?  I hadn't really been inclined previously to grow in the direction I did.  I cannot imagine I would have made such bold choices, had I not the maternal instinct.  So, the author makes a whole lot of sense for me.

For me, the most valuable message I garnered from this book it that it is in our best interest to learn to adapt, and be malleable.  He brought up three examples I can think of: 1. The Beatles, and how Lennon and McCartney played off one another so intuitively, fluidly, also taking into account their apparent talent and skills. 2. A girl from a background of disadvantage finds her way to a church where she learns to play a game so well that not only does she propel herself to the top, but she lifts her family up to her level, when they might have otherwise stayed the same.  as a side note, within this book, I want to note that there is a little lesson within the pages that reminds me of this story of the girl who lifted her family up to her level:  Before, in the book, I read the author saying something like, ""You can't be a prophet in your own town"".  He doesn't actually say that, but I got that he was indicating how it is common to become successful after leaving home, only to find, that the people you are coming back to later have not changed from before.  Also, it is possible that your family that you had left, might not recognize that you have changed, when you return. People cannot know what you have learned along the way if they haven't learned it themselves.  This rings so true. Also, it is quite an outcome for someone to have changed for the better, and then come back to their old life with the old people who have remained the same, and to then actually lift them up with you. if I have read this right, this is not a common outcome. This information is valuable to me for personal reasons.  3. A kid mentioned in the book had learned a game where at a certain point he discovered how he could learn to succeed exponentially.  His teammates, playing that game their own couldn't figure out for quite awhile why he was so good at it.  This was a competitive learning environment for them, and they all finally discovered that because he had taught himself to adapt to new situations, the environment in his game, the way he was playing it, made him more advanced, and those skills carried over into his career goals.  The other teammates were eventually able to catch up, but one of the benefits he garnered from this type of adaptive thinking is that it made him so much better off in his life, and it opened up a lot of opportunity for him that others didn't have.

As well as the benefits of being adaptive, and being malleable, the author shows quite a few examples of being ""super powered"", and productive. There was a man mentioned in the book who had the ultimate setup where he used a rhythmic, and strategically-timed, and planned approach, using technology to make the very most of his life.  It seemed to me that a person like this could work for NASA building rockets, so yes, it was not realistic for every average person I have known, but this is quite a great specimen of an example.  There is a woman who chose to work very hard for part of the time, and the other, relaxing and meditating.  This approach is quite efficient, and very conducive to her having a good outcome. Many more examples, many more lessons.

Loved this,

30470,2498,3668,"Every limiting behavior is rooted in a strength, say the authors. Sally and Marshall identify twelve of these behaviors typically seen in woman working in the USA business culture.

This book is the womans companion to Marshalls earlier bestselling, What Got You Here, Wont Get You There. Marshall explains that typically when he is delivering tough feedback to male executives they get defensive and women listen attentively and set to work with enthusiasm and zest.
The authors describe this book as a means to clear your path of self-imposed obstacles, so you can become more successful and take greater satisfaction in your work. The bulk of the book is spent describing each of the twelve behaviors, a case study, some business insights, and suggestions on how to break through it.  For example, habit three is, overhauling expertise.  Meaning mastering your current job keeps you in your current job, learn to master the job you want. Then there is a story about Ana, a software designer in a large tech firm in Silicon Valley.  She had to learn to not always have the answers but learn how to talk to anyone about technology.  Having the answers was less important as she moved ahead in her career. That is a behavior I see in the technical men I coach too. The business insights in this chapter related to types of power. While the book is geared for women, it can be helpful to men.

The book ends with a small section on how to overcome these behaviors.

30475,3967,3750,"Michio has given us notice: We must vacate the planet earth.

Before we pack our bags however, we have to figure a few things out. Where do we go and, once we arrive, how long before we get yet another eviction notice? Not to worry, MK has it all worked out. First we terraform Mars. Shouldnt be too hard; after all, we have no problem maintaining the earths temperature to within a few degrees Celsius. Should be a piece of cake to resettle on Mars and set up shop. Seriously, Michio understands the enormous task we have set before us and provides a measured guide to achieving a successful transition to a new home.

Along the way, we are treated to a necessarily speculative romp encompassing materials science, exotic space travel and transhumanism.

To provide a complete overview of the enormous effort confronting us, Michio does have to revisit earlier themes and concepts from previously published works. This is understandable and should not form the basis for sophomoric criticism.

We are told that evolution equipped us with weak and clumsy prospects for negotiating the African savanna and to compensate we developed intelligence. Maybe. But why weren't other animals also poorly equipped and also in need of compensating intelligence? Or why weren't we made stronger to begin with? Who knows? I don't know; you don't know; and with all due respect to MK, he doesnt know either. As far as what we shall become in the future as we manipulate our genome, its up for grabs.

We have been told that we are not special so many times I sometimes catch myself believing it. Of course if we live in a multiverse we should expect to find conditions just right for us in one of these universes. But until there is irrefutable evidence to confirm such a possibility, I remain unconvinced. Michio surely would concede that, if this is the only universe extant, the mere fact that we are hear and beginning to comprehend our universe makes us very special indeed.

Other authors are finally getting serious about AI and other imminent concerns we will face in the not too distant future and Michios foray into our need to find future habitats is a welcome contribution to these ongoing debates.

Readers will, as usual, enjoy the authors insights and his take on the future of space exploration.

30481,170,1313,"I purchased this to examine it from two perspectives. One, I admire accomplished executives. Those who read, plan, analyze and think. Those who inspire loyalty and accomplishment among their staff. Those who are able to get along with those with whom they disagree and try to seek common ground in solving problems. Those who manage to connect with people at all levels and work for fair resolutions to problems. Politics aside, I think Obama meets those criteria and this collection of photographs bears this out.

Second, I am a serious photographer, so when a former Chicago Tribune photographer who was also published in the National Geographic decides to select his favorites from the nearly 2 million shots he took as the official White House photographer, I think it bears a look. And a well rewarded look it was. Gorgeous shots capturing great expressions and circumstances. Phenomenal pictures taken under dramatic and difficult lighting conditions. Well done, Pete!

Not only an intimate view of Obama but a reminder of the difficult times we experienced during those eight years as the economy was rescued, major legislation passed, and horrible mass shootings occurred.

30485,1278,924,"In World War II, a critical part of the war effort was breaking German and Japanese codes. Yet, unlike major European countries, the US had very little in the way of a cryptography operation. One had been developed during the first World War, but Henry Stimson, William Howard Taft's Secretary of State, closed it down when he came into office in 1929.  His statement, ""Gentlemen don't read each other's mail,"" is beautiful, but of course, in the context of international diplomacy, completely wrong The Navy managed to preserve a tiny operation, but the onset of World War II, the US needed to ramp cryptography back up from almost nothing, very rapidly.

Yet the men, who ""ought"" to have done that work, were needed for combat operations. Enter the women.

Mundy, based on extensive research including interviews with many of the surviving ""code girls,"" gives us a revealing, compelling picture of the women, their experiences, the history of American cryptography, and the vital role it played in WWII.

Drawing women in to war work, as well as industrial work, to fill the places of men needed for combat, was a major social upheaval in America, and after the war ended, there was an equally major effort to roll it back and send women back home to make room, and inviting homes, for returning men. Yet ""freeing the men to fight"" had also meant, in many cases, that the women's own brothers or husbands or sweethearts were killed, even as the coders' and others' work had been aimed at keeping the fighting men safe and bringing them home faster.

At the same time, cryptography during the war was a major opportunity for women interested in math to do real and meaningful work in it, rather than being regarded as having wasted their time on a subject not really considered fit for women.

The conflicting pressures, as well as both the restrictions of highly classified war work combined with the freedom of earning their own money in settings far removed from their families and the neighbors they grew up among, created an exciting, confusing, challenging life for women cryptographers, even as the small number of men in their ranks experienced, too often, being regarded as failures and perhaps cowards, despite often being men who were too old for military service, or classified as 4F, medically unable to meet the physical demands of combat. Like the women, they were doing the work they could do, valuable work, that enabled the combat soldiers to fight more effectively.

It's a fascinating look at a long-hidden but vital aspect of the war, one the women and men involved couldn't talk about until decades later.

Highly recommended.

In SITG, Nassim speaks of Those Hidden Asymmetries and Their Consequences. Negativa, the agency problem, and other themes are reworked and reintroduced.

The author does offer insights worth considering, such as how the minority may dictate majority behavior and acquiescence, scale transformation, and bias-variance tradeoff.

30499,647,3846,"Olivia Twist is a gender bending retelling of Dickens' book Oliver Twist. This book makes many references to the original work of literature and reimagines the story from a girl's perspective.
Olivia Brownlow grew up on the streets of London as a boy to save herself from the horrible life of an orphan girl. She escapes the workhouse and is taken in by Jack, the Artful Dodger. One day they unwittingly pick her uncle's pocket, and her uncle takes her in as his own. Many years later, Olivia is reunited with Jack in polite society, and attraction and disagreements ensue. Soon Olivia and Jack are pulled into circumstances beyond their control, and they must fight a dangerous criminal in order to protect themselves and those they love. Will they be able to bring the criminal to justice and get their happy ending?
What a different sort of retelling! I enjoyed it even more than I expected to. There was just the right amount of danger, suspense, emotion, and humor to make it a great read. I loved the main characters, especially Olivia, Jack, the orphan boys, Brom, and Mr. Brownlow. I loved the ending as well and was very satisfied with the outcome.

30500,2563,3846,"What if Oliver Twist was actually...a girl? Lorie Langdon takes this seemingly simple scenario and crafts an engaging, ahem, twist on a beloved Dickens classic. In this version, Oliver--or Olivia--was rescued from the streets at age nine and has since grown up into a London society belle with a marriage offer from a highly sought bachelor. Yet while her head tells her to settle down with Maxwell Grimwig, Olivia can't ignore the other man who sets her body and soul aflame. He's Jack MacCarron, a roguish Irish gentleman with a mysterious past and an infuriating bent toward exposing everything Olivia doesn't want the world to know. She knows him, but from where and when? And might Jack be the one to help Olivia save the orphans she's taken under her wing from a dangerous street lord?

I loved the story of Oliver Twist as a preteen and teen, enough to tackle an unabridged hardback copy. But I always did kind of wish Oliver was female; later, analysis led me to believe Oliver's personality was not very masculine at all. Lorie Langdon read my mail. Her version of Oliver is a vivacious, determined, and fearless young woman who I thoroughly enjoyed rooting for and following. Olivia's involvement with the Hill Orphans and street culture, even after becoming a ""lady,"" gave her a unique story and increased my sympathy for her. In Olivia Twist, Lorie Langdon takes readers behind the scenes into street culture and reminds us that being ""rescued"" is only part of any orphan's story. That orphan also needs a purpose, fulfillment, and happiness, and Olivia gets those things after a long and engrossing journey.

The other characters provide one of the most colorful casts I've encountered lately. Because I've read the original Dickens work, they're familiar. But Lorie puts her own spin on each. Jack MacCarron, for instance, is this story's Artful Dodger all grown up. He knows his way around society and is a real charmer, but he hasn't lost his intelligence or streetwise edge. Arguably, he grows as much if not more than Olivia, especially in terms of spirituality. He's annoying but in a winsome way, and it's gratifying to see him become worthy of Olivia. I also loved each of the Hill Orphans, Uncle Brownlow, the vivacious Cousin Vi, and even the villain, who has one of the best motives I've read in a while.

The world of Victorian London springs to life in this novel, from Cavendish Square to Seven Dials and everywhere in between. Lorie nails everything from the differences in accents and dialect to the code of the streets. The world engaged me as much as the characters did, and it was great to revisit a place that felt familiar, yet had its own distinct flavor in the hands of a modern author.

The Christian element in Olivia Twist is extremely subtle. If I hadn't seen it listed under Christian fiction and on Christian websites, I would not have caught it until fairly late in the story. Lorie takes some risks, such as having characters curse occasionally. But sometimes subtlety is just what a story needs to point to Christ, and it mostly works here. For instance, there are a lot of references to laying down one's life for a friend, being a prodigal, and depending on God for intervention. Sometimes I wish the spirituality had been clearer, but as I said, it mostly works. Other than that and a few editing issues, Olivia Twist is crafted beautifully.",1521244800,4,oliv twist actuallya girl lori langdon take seemingli simpl scenario craft engag ahem twist belov dicken classic version oliveror oliviawa rescu street age nine sinc grown london societi bell marriag offer highli sought bachelor yet head tell settl maxwel grimwig olivia cant ignor man set bodi soul aflam he jack maccarron roguish irish gentleman mysteri past infuri bent toward expo everyth olivia doesnt want world know know might jack one help olivia save orphan she taken wing danger street lord love stori oliv twist preteen teen enough tackl unabridg hardback copi alway kind wish oliv femal later analysi led believ oliv person masculin lori langdon read mail version oliv vivaci determin fearless young woman thoroughli enjoy root follow olivia involv hill orphan street cultur even becom ladi gave uniqu stori increas sympathi olivia twist lori langdon take reader behind scene street cultur remind u rescu part orphan stori orphan also need purpos fulfil happi olivia get thing long engross journey charact provid one color cast ive encount late ive read origin dicken work theyr familiar lori put

30504,2387,3642,"The Great Alone- Kristin Hannah, author; Julia Whelan, narrator
This is a hard book to summarize because it goes off on so many tangents over several decades, really beginning in 1974, with a major change in lifestyle for the Allbrights, and ending with a published piece about Alaska, by Lenora Walker, in 2009. Although all the dots connect and get resolved in the end, there is a danger of giving the story away in the summary, so I must warn readers that this review contains spoilers.
Ernt Allbright and Coraline Golliher fell in love when she was 16 and still in high school. Her parents objected to him. When she became pregnant, she quit school, and they ran away and eloped. He worked as a mechanic, and they lived a vagabond sort of life until he went to Vietnam. After his helicopter was downed, he was captured and became a prisoner of war in a place known for its brutality. Cora was left alone with her daughter, until he returned, a much damaged man, prone to nightmares and violence.
One day, in 1974, a letter came from the father of one of his Nam buddies. Bo had died there and had left him his land in Alaska. As he found it hard to be in the real world, a place where Patti Hearst was kidnapped, Watergate was being investigated, and Israelis were murdered at the Munich Olympics, he decided they should move to Alaska, the new frontier, and start life again without the encumbrances of modern technology, without the governments interference. In Alaska, there was no electricity in the shack he inherited. There was no indoor plumbing. There were no hard and fast laws to follow. Survival was the only game. His mental health seemed to improve. Then the long nights came.
Lenora was 13 years old when they moved to Kaneq. She loved Alaskas beauty and majesty. Although it was a hard life, without creature comforts, she adjusted well. Her father was a difficult taskmaster who taught her to shoot and kill for food, who taught her how to survive. The neighbors taught her mother and her to forage for food, plant gardens and smoke meat. The neighbors helped them build outbuildings, clean the shack left to her father, and in general, to learn the way of the land in Alaska. People who survived there were strong and independent, some escaping from something and some looking to leave the rat race that society was rapidly becoming.
Cora and Ernts love was as dysfunctional as Ernt was. Cora could not leave the abusive relationship and often made her daughter responsible for keeping the peace by humoring Ernt to prevent him from exploding. Leni felt responsible for her mothers safety and was afraid to leave without her. She feared for her mothers safety. As the years passed, although just a teenager, she began to see her father more clearly than her mother did, and she began to be afraid. She wished her mother would leave him, but her mother kept making excuses for him and forgiving him. She promised he would change, and he often begged for forgiveness, promising his violent outbursts and reactions would never happen again. He even promised to stop drinking, but he never did.
The life was hard and when winter came, the darkness, isolation and weather set her father off and he often had violent tantrums, striking out at Cora, but generally, not at Leni. While attending the one room schoolhouse she met another teenager her age, Matthew Walker, and both quickly bonded. Soon that bond grew into devotion and love, but as her father became more and more irrational, he began to hate the Walkers because of their wealth and influence, and also because Walker wanted to modernize the town, with electricity, plumbing, better roads and guest houses. As he became more and more jealous, belligerent and dangerous, the neighbors rejected him and his ideas. He grew angrier and the Allbrights became more and more isolated from the community.
After a particularly violent incident, Leni and Cora tried to run away, but they skidded off the road and were injured. Cora refused to report Ernt to the police. Instead, after medical treatment, they returned to the cabin and their fear. Another time, after an incident, Matthew and Leni ran in one direction and Cora ran in another, to prevent Ernt from finding them. Cora promised she would call the police and report him. Large Marge, another settler would help her. However, in the end, she refused to press charges and he was soon released from jail. Meanwhile, Matthew and Leni were severely injured when they tried to return to see how Cora was doing. Matthews injuries were far worse, and he was placed in a coma, with brain damage. He might never wake up again. He might never walk or talk again. Once more, Cora and Leni returned to the cabin. Things rapidly escalated downward and as Ernt builds a fence to pen them in, they become more and more afraid, and he grows more and more dangerous. Alaska is called the great alone. It is a dangerous place that one has to constantly try to contain in order to survive. There was the ever present danger of wild animals, limited supplies in the winter, extreme weather and tides. Self sufficiency was a must, but it was a skill that was learned and acquired through trial and error and community cooperation. Neighbors counted on each other for help. Ernt wanted to isolate them from the community. That was dangerous.
Finally, a series of events caused him to completely erupt. When he started beating Leni, threatening her life, it was the last straw for Cora. She took matters into her own hands, at last. They were on the run, sneaking out of Kaneq, racing to Seattle where her estranged parents lived. They begged for help. Leni was pregnant. They assumed new identities. Their many foolish choices had condemned them to this chaotic life
As the years passed, Lenis son, Matthew Jr., grows into a happy, obedient boy who brings joy to all of them. Eventually, Leni even gets her college degree. Then her mother falls terminally ill, and she writes out a confession for the crime she had committed. After her death, Leni returned to Alaska with her mothers ashes and the written confession, as Cora had requested. She reunited with her friends and introduced her son to his relatives and his severely injured father.
The story was about soldiers who suffered from the trauma of war, it was about battered wives with no power, it was about young, romantic love and about dysfunctional love between disturbed and damaged people. It was about the foolish decisions people make. It was about people who wanted to prevent change and some who preferred it. The author states it was about people who had dreams.
The book was obviously well researched. The landscape of Alaska came to life. I felt as if I was there when the darkness that threatened Ernt, came down around him, loosening his fragile self control. The narrator read the characters personalities so well that I was placed directly into each characters head, experiencing their individual traumas, and there were traumas galore, so many in fact, that it felt like the author was a bit afraid to leave any experience of life out of the narrative. However, her writing style held my attention, as I wanted to find out how all the myriad problems were resolved, but the narrative often seemed too intense to imagine as a part of reality. There were just too many incidents that made me question whether or not they really could have happened. Could characters really keep making the same excuses and mistakes over and over again without learning from them?  After awhile, don't apologies for the same infractions lose their meaning? Would the prince and princess really find each other again? Too many problems piled up, emergencies piled up, dangerous rescues and life threatening situations piled up, so at times, the storyline simply stretched credulity and became like a fairytale.",1521244800,4,great alon kristin hannah author julia whelan narrat hard book summar goe mani tangent sever decad realli begin 1974 major chang lifestyl allbright end publish piec alaska lenora walker 2009 although dot connect get resolv end danger give stori away summari must warn reader review contain spoiler ernt allbright coralin gollih fell love 16 still high school parent object becam pregnant quit school ran away elop work mechan live vagabond sort life went vietnam helicopt down captur becam prison war place known brutal cora left alon daughter return much damag man prone nightmar violenc one day 1974 letter came father one nam buddi bo die left land alaska found hard real world place patti hearst kidnap waterg investig isra murder munich olymp decid move alaska new frontier start life without encumbr modern technolog without govern interfer alaska electr shack inherit indoor plumb hard fast law follow surviv game mental health seem improv long

I bought the first book from Tesco. (Not knowing anything about the trilogy) I read the back and thought, yes I will have some of that........finished my chores on a Saturday afternoon, house to myself, so I settled down with a cupa and my new book. I have to admit I was a little surprised at the content, especially as I bought it from Tesco, of all places. Next thing I knew it was past midnight and I just didn't want to put it down.

Sunday morning I was straight onto Amazon to order the other two ready for when I finished the first book. I also took the time to actually read some of the reviews. I am so glad I didn't read them first as I know I would have been put off by the negative feed back. Some of the comments I have to say were ""good points well made"" but my advice is just read the books for what they are and enjoy.

Now, I am not saying that these are the best books I have read but I did find them very addictive. I had to know how the characters developed and I was not disappointed, but like so many other readers I would love to read the story from Christians point of view. Please, please, please!!!

The author writes in a poetic way using descriptions that I could visualize, smell and emotionally react too. It was creepy at times with a hint of the dread to come.

Myriam and Paul are the parents of two young children. They are living in a flat in Paris and Myriam makes the decision to resume her career and becomes a criminal defense lawyer (ironically). They think they have found a ""perfect"" nanny named Louise. They hire her and she immediately impresses them by doing such a great job taking care of the kids, cleaning and even cooking.

Louise has created a home of peace and harmony, but as we begin to learn of her past (through flashbacks of her former life) and we see disturbing scenes. She begins to do very strange things that upset Myriam and Paul, but they have grown to depend on her help. As the story progresses, you begin to see what the parents do not and the end may leave you with more questions than answers.

Philippa, Gwen, and Minnie live on the Upper East Side of New York City, and while I found none of the characters particularly likable or relatable, I enjoyed watching how the story unhurriedly unfolded, exposing betrayal, secrets, and lies.

Gemma and the Old Biddies are off to Vienna!

The Old Biddies, a name given to the group of women that frequent Gemma's tea room, consists of Mabel, Ethel, Florence and Glenda.
While the quirky group of ladies tend to annoy Gemma, they always seem to find themselves tangled up in murder.
This time is no different, the biddies and Gemma are off to Vienna to claim Gemma's prize.

They stay at an adorable bed and breakfast, owned by a dear friend of Gemma's mum.
While there, the group meets some colorful characters, including Herr Moritz, a man with a barbed tongue and a nasty personality.
When Herr Moritz is found dead, everyone thinks it's an accident. It certainly could be, but according to the Old Biddies, it's murder!
There are too many suspects, all with good motives so the biddies finally convince Gemma to help investigate.

A scorned lover and a museum owner seem to have the best motives.

Join Gemma and the Old Biddies in this top notch story by H.Y. Hanna.
I feel like Ms. Hanna breathed some new life into these characters. This book is well written and has a light and airy feel to it. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments in this 8th installment of the Oxford Tea Room series.

30545,3577,2045,"*Words of Radiance* is one of those books that is, truly, hard to rate or review. This is largely due to two factors. First of all, it is so big that it's hard to summarize or deal with much of the huge amount of stuff in the story. The second issue is that it was both so good and yet so hard to read. What I mean is that it was well-written, absorbing, and a true pleasure to read, but yet it was also so depressing in some parts that it was hard to read.

This is because, while the psychological arc of Kaladin is not over yet (he has oaths still to swear), the major emotional parts that ripped him up to the point of being a rather hateful man at times, and willing to be a bad guy, are resolved. But, boy oh boy, does it take some doing. And that struggle to come out from what really and truly *are* horrific traumas is what this book shows us. What's more, he's not the only one to endure much anguish now and in the past.

As the narrative begins, Dalinar is trying to make sense of the visions set by the Almighty, one of the gods of his world, who he has learned is dead, but left parts of himself and a plan to still save humanity. Of course, they the people of Roshar now face the awesome power of the evil god Odium. Readers, of course, from what they've seen in this and (if they've read them) other novels in the ""Comere"", as Brandon Sanderson calls his fictional universe, know *some* of what is coming. Dalinar and the other characters do not. It's quite a battle, as future books will, I'm sure, show us.

In the midst of this are the intersecting plots of Kaladin and Shallan. Shallan knows she is a surge binder and Knight Radiant, but doesn't want to admit it. Her powers could place her in jeopardy and make her tasks to uproot an evil group more difficult. They also would force her to face past traumas. Kaladin is paranoid and fearful, and thus doesn't want to admit to Dalinar who he is. It takes events beyond their control and moral conundrums to convince them to reveal themselves to the world.

The story is really so huge and complicated that it's quite difficult to give more details, so I won't try. I'll just say that a final battle with the Parshendi, which is also the first battle in a longer conflict with an impossibly strong foe, is upon them. Only if Dalinar and the other characters can get their acts together, and Shallan and Kaladin can get past their fears and move forward, can the heroes stand a chance in hell of winning.

The characterization in this book was great, though again, it was painful at parts. Kaladin was the most painful, but to see the trauma Shallan deals with and her tragic (just as painful in it's own way as that of Kaladin) past, well, it's so much. You just wanna give them both a big hug. Adolin is awesome as well, and he is shown to have a much deeper personality than others might think. The first volume did show his thoughts are complex, but this second volume shows that he is a much more insightful and clever person than many might think at first. While he is not the smart one compared to his family, fiance and best friend, he is, indeed, perceptive. Renarin, Jasnah and others have more expanded roles in the third book, so we'll see more of their characterization there. It would be truthful to say that the characterization was masterful, and I just don't have time to deal with summarizing it in this review.

One thing I like, which is an aspect of the series as a whole, is how certain virtuous traits are explored. They can have good and bad sides if taken to unhealthy extremes or used to justify unhealthy or bad actions. For instance, Kaladin's love for others and desire to save them, is a truly and wonderfully good thing. It's great and awesome that he is so self-sacrificing and that he wants to protect folks. But if he lets the pain of loss and desire to not feel it dominate him, then that is bad. It can increase his sense of hopelessness and turn to darker paths. It can also lead him to making bad decisions because he doesn't think of the consequences.

The truth is that he must find a balance, which he is still working on, between accepting loss and doing what he thinks is right. Another part of doing right is to accept responsibility and to, well, do the right thing, even when it is hard. As he notes in his darkest moment in the book, saving only those you like is not doing what is right, it's selfishness. Saving those you hate, that is doing the right thing.

Despite the harshness of some of the backgrounds to characters here, and the suffering it is unpleasant to see them undergo, the series comes out firmly on the side of idealism in the end. In a time of darker and edgier, more ""realistic"" fiction, it's refreshing to see a story that might strive for some realism, but does so whilst still shows good winning and heroes *being heroes*.

It was when I was reading this that I came to some personal epiphanies. I know that this is taking the scenes into a different context, but it still is what I realized. This is that I am not the man I want to be. I have not followed God's Word to love others. Like many works of fiction can sometimes do, like much art can sometimes do, this story lead me back to the truths of the Bible.

In my reading of the Bible, our service to God is not just about doing right upon salvation because of the gratitude we feel towards God for saving us, though that is certainly part of the equation. God doesn't save us from Hell and separation from Himself alone. He also saves us from the suffering that sin itself is. Oh, it is at first often easier to sin, but eventually the guilt, the lack of joy, and the knowledge we just are not who we want to be, who we were *made* to be hits us. God saves us from that. In His Word are the messages and such we need follow and apply to our lives in order to be that person He created us to be. Sometimes we don't realize we are not following Him and His instructions. Other factors such as friends, and yes, art, can remind us.

So it was here. To take the theme and play with it, I want to show love to those I do not like. I want to be able to say that, yes, I would sacrifice myself for them, but I want to go beyond that and what Kaladin does, and say I would and *do* love them. I want to give love and kindness to others, even those I really don't want much to do with. Indeed, in the third book are hints Kaladin is moving on this path. Before anyone mentions a certain event in the book with two other characters, the situation and morality is arguably different, so it doesn't undercut this.

That is the lesson of Kaladin to me. There are others from him and Shallan, such as not backing away from responsibilities to do what is right, among others. And lessons from other characters to boot. But this was the one that struck me. Saving, and even more so, *loving* those I dislike. This doesn't mean excusing evil and precluding justice. It means showing love while combatting the one and ensuring the other. Justice, not revenge.

Brandon Sanderson's skill at the craft of writing and in exploring various themes are both top-notch. Highly Recommended.

Synopsis: Kady, Ezra, Hanna, and Nik narrowly escaped with their lives from the attacks on Heimdall station and now find themselves crammed with 2,000 refugees on the container ship, Mao. With the jump station destroyed and their resources scarce, the only option is to return to Kerenza--but who knows what they'll find seven months after the invasion? Meanwhile, Kady's cousin, Asha, survived the initial BeiTech assault and has joined Kerenza's ragtag underground resistance. When Rhys--an old flame from Asha's past--reappears on Kerenza, the two find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. With time running out, a final battle will be waged on land and in space, heros will fall, and hearts will be broken.

I think this series will always hold a special place in my heart. I loved this series and I was so sad to see it end. But being the anxious beaver I was I had to read it ASAP. The story picks up from where we last left off in the series with our heroes and we have two new ones. I thought the story picked up from the last book right where we left off and that the characters blended well together. The character development of all 5 of our previous heroes was well done as well and the plot and the pacing kept the story interesting. I also thought the writing was well done as well, if really does sound like different voices talking instead of just 2. I think co-authoring works well with this book.

However, I did have an issue with Asha and Rhys. Asha, while developed, didn't get much book time. Rhys wasn't very well developed in my opinion and we didn't really learn a lot about them. Their reunion and him deciding to help her out seemed really quick. The plot they came up with at the end of the book wasn't also explained for the audience, which could make it confusing.

Verdict: An action-packed adventure with your favorite heroes, plus two new ones that don't get as much book time as I would have liked. Great if you like throwbacks to the old IM chat books.",1521331200,4,rate 455 genr ya scifi recommend age 15 violenc gore death child death psychot ai teenag take charg page 615 author websit ami kaufman jay kristoff amazon link disclaim none bought book synopsi kadi ezra hanna nik narrowli escap live attack heimdal station find cram 2000 refuge contain ship mao jump station destroy resourc scarc option return kerenzabut know theyll find seven month invas meanwhil kadi cousin asha surviv initi beitech assault join kerenza ragtag underground resist rhysan old flame asha pastreappear kerenza two find opposit side conflict time run final battl wage land space hero fall heart broken think seri alway hold special place heart love seri sad see end anxiou beaver read asap stori pick last left seri hero two new one thought stori pick last book right left charact blend well togeth charact develop 5 previou hero well done well plot pace kept stori interest also thought write well done well realli sound like differ voic talk instead 2 think coauthor work well book howev issu asha rhi

30550,1689,1962,"Do I really have to write a review for this book? I mean, it has something like 1,892,468 ratings and 29,593 reviews on Goodreads. No joke...I copy/pasted that number! So, I mean, do I really HAVE to review this book?

Do I? Fine. Okay, here's what I didn't like...some of the scenes dragged on and on. That's it. Nothing else wrong with the book and I can't exactly put my finger on exact scenes that stuck out at me. I just know that quite a few times I wanted to get back to the action.

Having read this book AFTER seeing the movies firstthis is my first read through, okay?I also want to fangirl over someone. But, that's only because I know spoilers. I can't exactly fangirl over actions in this book until I get through the next. So, Y'all just wait because I WILL read the next book as soon as I can!

Anyway, though I felt this book was slow in parts, it's still a fantastic book and I cannot wait to pick up the next.

I also want to say that you'll appreciate this book more after you have finished the series. So, if this is the first time you're reading it, go back and reread after you finish.

30554,913,3560,"The Hazel Wood seems to have generated a lot of buzz this year. There is this great divide between the love and dislike (hate is such a strong word).  I started off eagerly adding this one to my TBR with great enthusiasm that slowly began to waiver as reviews rolled out. Fortunately, in my case, my fears were unwarranted and this was a success! I lean heavily into the group of readers who embrace this darker tale with open arms.

Alice is a 17-year-old girl who has spent her entire life on the road with her mother Ella.  A life clouded with bad luck, they hurriedly pick up and relocate each time things go wrong. She also happens to be the granddaughter of Althea Prosperine, an author known for an elusive and famous collection of dark fairy tales entitled Tales from the Hinterland. But after her mother receives notice that Althea has passed and then mysteriously vanishes, Alice soon discovers that there is much to her grandmothers collection. With the help of a young fan and classmate Ellery Finch, she sets out for her grandmothers estate, The Hazel Wood, in search of her mother. But she finds more than she could ever bargain for.

I will be the first to admit that The Hazel Wood unfolds at a somewhat leisurely pace for nearly 70% of the book. Character development is slow and challenging. We are presented with a protagonist that is difficult to like but not hard to appreciate. While I struggled to love Alices rough attitude, I also found myself unable to fault her. I found the fact that she referred to her mother by name to be irritating and also often felt she was overly aggressive. But when reflecting on her disheveled life and lack of roots, it was still relatable or at least understandable at its core. It works. You do not have to like characters for them to be viable and rewarding. Alice is a prime example of this. I also found great appreciation in supporting characters such as Ellery and those she encounters during their journey that offered a complimentary balance to Alices flaws and shortcomings.

The storyline was where I found complete satisfaction with The Hazel Wood. Alberts decision to incorporate the stories from Althea Prosperines book into the narrative was brilliant and countered the pacing issues I was facing. I thoroughly loved reading the dark and twisted fairytales. I think I may have favored them over the actual plot though so I can see how some found disappointment within depending on expectations. For myself, I was entirely okay with this fact and the brief tales drove me to want to explore Alice and her mothers disappearance more. They were cleverly placed throughout, providing the necessary momentum and turning what might have otherwise been another YA fantasy into something special, a new collection of fairy tales.

My love he wooed me
My love he slew me
My love he buried my bones
His love he married
His love I buried
My love now wanders alone 

The writing is engaging and detailed while remaining plot oriented and forgoing the typical frivolities. The fairytales unfold with a poetic prose. There is an admirable lack of the normal tropes one would expect to encounter, and the end experience is hauntingly smooth and lingering. It has been a week since I completed the book, and I do not find myself struggling to review it. It remains as vivid now as the very night I completed it. That alone speaks volumes. Fans of those traditionally bleaker fairytales who enjoy a good mystery will want to sink their teeth into this one.",1521331200,4,hazel wood seem gener lot buzz year great divid love dislik hate strong word start eagerli ad one tbr great enthusiasm slowli began waiver review roll fortun case fear unwarr success lean heavili group reader embrac darker tale open arm alic 17yearold girl spent entir life road mother ella life cloud bad luck hurriedli pick reloc time thing go wrong also happen granddaught althea prosperin author known elus famou collect dark fairi tale entitl tale hinterland mother receiv notic althea pas mysteri vanish alic soon discov much grandmoth collect help young fan classmat elleri finch set grandmoth estat hazel wood search mother find could ever bargain first admit hazel wood unfold somewhat leisur pace nearli 70 book charact develop slow challeng present protagonist difficult like hard appreci struggl love alic rough attitud also found unabl fault found fact refer mother name irrit also often felt overli aggress reflect dishevel life lack root

But, I did not know about Westinghouse's involvement and the AC/DC Current War.

I really got drawn into this book and I can't wait to have my husband read it, as he has always had an interest in Tesla. From there, the book will go to both of my sons, one of whom hopes to own a Tesla car in his future, and the other, who, like his father, has felt that Tesla never got the credit and fame he deserved.

30565,3808,3547,"I loved this book!  I love Louisa Clark and her family.  There were some good points to this book, and some not so good points.

Good points:  Louisa and Sam. I love their love story.  At one point they break up.  I had to actually go to the end of the book to see if they would get back together.  I think that they are the perfect?  Do they get back together?  You'll see.  Louisa's family.  I love how her family interacts with each other.  The author did a good job of bringing her family into the story via emails while she was living in New York.  Some of my favorite parts was when she would would go home to England.

Bad points:  I found her job rather boring in this book.  The Gopniks, the people whom she worked for are despicable people.  I didn't like anything about them, and I didn't like who she was when she worked for them.  A man named Josh.  This was a new love interest for Louisa.  As I mentioned, I am team Sam.  Josh only ruined parts of the book for me.  And really, did he have to look just like Will?  Come on!

Worst Point: Will- LET IT GO!!!  I get it.  She loved him.  She only knew him for 6 months.  Move her on please.  It was totally weird and just too much the way that Camellia Traynor contacts here in this story.  Enough already!!!!  I have gotten totally bored with Will being in her head.  That is the only reason that this book gets 4 stars instead of five.

I do hope that another Louisa Clark comes out. I don't want this to be the end.  I want to hear about her getting married and having a baby.  Can you imagine the Clark family planning a wedding and watching her being pregnant?

  Running Blind is classic Lee Child and the story moves with a brisk pace with Reacher helping the Bureau under duress while wrestling with his relationship with Jodie and the loss of his rambling lifestyle and feelings for an attractive FBI agent.

This book is about Wonder Woman before, when she was just Diana, princess of the Amazons. Diana longs to prove herself to her sisters on the island and one day she finally has that chance when she rescues a mortal girl, even at the risk of exile. Alia is not just an ordinary girl though, but a Warbringer, a descendant from a long line destined to bring about an age of war. Together, Diana and Alia must fight against those who want Alia dead and break the Warbringer curse once and for all.

Basically this book was awesome! It has action, amazing characters, and so much fun banter between friends. It was so close to being 5 stars, I'm actually a bit heartbroken that it didn't end up that way. Still liked it a lot but... it was just so close.

Diana is an amazing character. She's obviously really badass but she's funny too, and her friendship with Alia was amazing. Strong female friendships in books, especially YA are the best and I wish I saw them more often. Plus Diana interacting with the modern world was just hilarious at times. I pretty much loved all the characters too, Alia and her friends Nim and Theo. They were such squad goals.

There was so much mythology! More than I thought and it was great! This book moved so fast and the action was spot on. I wish there could have been more of Diana kicking ass but it was still pretty nice.

When I was reading this book, it was just so fun. I was laughing, I was cheering Diana and company on, I was falling for these lovely characters but then there was a big bad guy reveal... and it was awful. It lowered my rating of this book so fast, I still can't believe it was actually real. It was just so out of place, clich, and it pissed me off because it didn't make ANY sense either. I still want to drop more stars but I still liked most of the book. Just that one major thing.

30586,4675,210,"Warcross takes place in the slight future where a virtual reality game called Warcross is played by millions all over the world. For Emika, it's a way to make a living. Emika is a hacker and a bounty hunter, paid to track down those who bet on the game illegally. The score isn't always so good though so when the chance for Emika to make some fast cash happens, she takes it. Unfortunately it was hacking into the international Warcross Championships, where she glitches it thus exposing her identity. After her hack, Emika draws the attention of young billionaire Hideo Tanaka. He needs a spy in the upcoming tournament to find a security flaw and find the one trying to disrupt the games. But what Emika uncovers is far more than she thought, with lives and Warcross at stake.

This book was great! For the most part. Emika is a great main character. She's tough, has rainbow hair, is a great hacker and player, and stands up for herself. She's been through some hard times and just wants to finish the job she was hired for but she isn't going to back down. She does end up getting a bit closer to her boss than she'd intended. Hideo is mysterious and has a lot of walls and emotional baggage and I was here for that romantic subplot. When they were sharing their emotions while making out- yes please.

The Warcross games were so fun! I kind of got a Hunger Games vibe, but a lot less murdery. They were imaginative and exciting. I want to play! Another thing I really liked was the dark underbelly of Warcross, the Dark World. It was creepy, and it was so well done.

But that's kind of where one of the issues I had with this book begin though: the VR itself. While I get it's the future, it's not that far into the future (or at least I would think, besides the NeuroLink, everything else is the same and there is no mention of a year).

This tech made no sense at times and I would have accepted it being magic versus any sort of computer science. The worst part is that it didn't even TRY to explain it.

Then there was times where I wasn't really sure how they were moving. At first they were sitting down while moving virtually by twitching their feet to move or something. Other times they moved their hands while VRing.... do they move to play the game or not? How real does it feel when you aren't walking around yourself? How does the guy in the wheelchair move around in the game? I know it's nitpicking but it just bothered me.

Onto more positives though- the casual diversity! Warcross is a worldwide game and hell yeah if it's going to feel that way with people being different nationalities and throwing those different languages around. Tokyo being the setting was also really fun but I wished they were outside more. I also wished that Emika had bonded with her fellow teammates more but hoping in the sequel! This book really opens up for the sequel, while also tying up some loose ends, like the identity of Zero.

The writing was just so good, and the characters were so well made. The descriptions of the games were really awesome. Despite my issues with this book, I did still really enjoy it and I need the sequel right now and not next year.",1521331200,4,warcross take place slight futur virtual realiti game call warcross play million world emika way make live emika hacker bounti hunter paid track bet game illeg score isnt alway good though chanc emika make fast cash happen take unfortun hack intern warcross championship glitch thu expo ident hack emika draw attent young billionair hideo tanaka need spi upcom tournament find secur flaw find one tri disrupt game emika uncov far thought live warcross stake book great part emika great main charact she tough rainbow hair great hacker player stand she hard time want finish job hire isnt go back end get bit closer bos shed intend hideo mysteri lot wall emot baggag romant subplot share emot make ye plea warcross game fun kind got hunger game vibe lot le murderi imagin excit want play anoth thing realli like dark underbelli warcross dark world creepi well done that kind one issu

30591,2524,1438,"The Flight Attendant is the first book that I have ready by Chris Bohjalian, but it definitely won't be the last.  The character development and the different settings and locations made for a very nice thriller.

The main character is Cassie Bowen.  Cassie is a flight attendant who drinks too much and has a habit of sleeping with strangers.  She is basically spiraling out of control and it all comes to a head when she wakes up one morning in a hotel room, lying next to a dead man.  Even though she suffers from black outs, she is sure that she didn't kill him.  To make it even worse, she is in the middle east, where not only is she in trouble for possibly killing a man, but a promiscuous woman is certainly frowned upon.

As she struggles to remember what happened that night.  She learns that the dead man was a hedge fund manager and that the girl who showed up and shared a vodka with them, might have something to do with death.

Part murder mystery, part espionage spy thriller and part character study, this book held my interest from beginning to end.  Having Cassies character be so flawed really added to the dimension of the story.  Also adding to the story was a glimpse into the life of a flight attendant.

Very nice, solid mystery.  I read it quickly in a couple of days.

30594,2511,2939,"This is another book on the Bill Gates reading list and I have yet to be disappointed.  That said, while I believe that the fundamental premise of this book is fairly intuitive (that violence has declined over the course of history), Pinker suggests that it runs contrary to popular wisdom owing to its glorification by modern media.  Consequently, he embarks on an ambitious and thorough examination of the history of violence through the ages.  The book is readable and informative but (IMHO) was not revelationary.

The book is divided into several parts:
. SIX TRENDS
  - the transition from the anarchy of the hunter / gatherer society
  - the birth of large kingdoms with centralized authority during the middle ages
 -  The age of enlightenment and reason during the 17th and 18th centuries that saw the abolition of socially sanctioned forms of violence
 -  the long peace post World War II as developed states largely stopped waging war
 -  the post.-cold war era where civil wars, genocide and the like have largely subsided
 -  the declaration of human rights, signed in 1948, that has seen a growing level of revulsion and refusal to accept smaller scale aggression and violence against minorities and other helpless parties such and gays, ethnic minorities and the like

FIVE INNER DEMONS
Notwithstanding my inner urge to wage road rage on incompetent drivers, mankind does not have innate urge to commit violence. However, there are certain environmental triggers that propel people to commit violent acts.
-  Predatory or instrumental violence committed as a means to an end
 -  The need for dominance and authority
-  the desire for revenge and the pursuit of justice, whether real or perceived
-  a sadistic pleasure in someone else's suffering
-  an ideology that justifies a violent means to an end.

30597,4940,753,"Blurb....
When quiet Ellen Lang enters Elvis Cole's Disney-deco office, she's lost something very valuable - her husband and young son. The case seems simple enough, but Elvis isn't thrilled. Neither is his enigmatic partner and firepower Joe Pike.
Their search down the seamy side of Hollywood's studio lots and sculptured lawns soon leads them deep into a nasty netherworld of drugs and sex - and murder. Now the case is getting interesting, but it's also turned ugly. Because everybody, from cops to starlets to crooks, has declared war on Ellen and Elvis.

I read this first Crais book probably a year or two after it was first published in 1987. Robert Crais was one of a new breed of writer I wanted to get into when I made the reading jump from the horror genre into crime fiction. Crais along with Robert Parker, Elmore Leonard and James Lee Burke opened my eyes to a different kind of fiction and a far different kind of life on the streets of America than I was used to living in sleepy Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire.
Whilst my reading has mainly remained in the crime zone, for the past 20 years, with the odd foray elsewhere, I kind of neglected Crais and his creation Elvis Cole. I still acquired new Crais books along the way, but can't say that I ever made the actual jump into opening the damn things and getting stuck into them. Cole with his sometime sidekick Joe Pike appeared in a series of 12 or so books, before Pike was given his own showcase by the author. Vaguely recalling the enigmatic Pike, and wanting to read more about his exploits, the OCD within me dictated that I re-visit the first Elvis Cole and start again back in late 80's LA.
Cole is an interesting enough protagonist in this book; a private investigator for hire, a military background having served in Vietnam, an exponent of some form of martial arts, a practising yoga fiend, wise-cracking mouth, a bit of a loner with only a couple of friends; Pike and Portias - a detective with the LAPD. Crais at time steers Cole close to the stereotypical PI of the genre, but manages to infuse enough depth to the man to allay any concerns that he's a cardboard cut-out. Cole's drink of choice seems to be beer rather than the obligatory bottle of bourbon stored in the lower desk drawer.
Crais entertains with his first book, whilst Cole predictably gets to the bottom of the mystery and achieves a resolution of sorts for Ellen; the book was good enough to withstand a second reading 20 plus years after I first cracked its spine. Good enough for me to follow straight on with the second book in the series - Stalking The Angel.

So, I had to dock this one star for the whole conversation Charles and Anna had about Bran & Mercy  in chapter 1. I was all 'what the heck?, that just doesn't fit with previous books'. If you want spoilers, there are other reviews that go into greater detail.
Meeting some of the wildings and learning a little more pack history, and I guess world history, was good.
I liked the way Anna stretched herself and was able to help certain people. I like that she is showing her strength and trusting herself. She and Charles compliment each other well.
I liked getting to know Leah a bit more, although I don't completely buy into the reasons given as to why she is so mean to Mercy. I always like Asil, and wish I knew if I was pronouncing his name right in my mind.

30607,1778,1046,"When I saw the movie adaptation of this book, I felt like the presentation of this somewhat interesting idea was already dated by about five years. This made me curious if the book was any better. As is probably no surprise to anyone, the book was much better. Sure, the movie cut a few things from the book that I thought were a bit too unnecessary (all the sex, that is) or underutilized (the Calvin character), but the book really hits at the intensity of the internet-addicted generation. I would even go so far as to say The Circle is the modern version of  1984 .

Im somewhat torn when it comes to the message presented here. I understand how trying to stay on top of millions of e-mails, and thousands of social media updates can be utterly overwhelming. I also agree that a lot of ideas that seem to be beneficial to society will have the removal of personal privacy as an adverse side effect. However, the vehemence that people participate in the world does bring up a good point about apathy. Granted, I don't think we should be nearly as extreme in our oversharing on social media, but if the majority of success is just showing up, then why do so many people find themselves too busy to even participate? Do they not want to engage with their fellow humans?

I did appreciate how the transition from utopia to dystopia went almost entirely unchecked. The main characters journey really helped to show how the addicting nature of online interactions and instant feedback can get out of hand. From documenting our lives to searching for information to even searching for love (of which internet dating wasn't included in the movie), the internet is a powerful place. If anything The Circle highlights how dangerous a true democracy can really be, particularly if the minority opinions are known at each decision point.

30609,2486,2748,"Friday is one of Robert A Heinlein's later novels (1982). The story concerns an AP or artificial person who was ""made"" rather than born. As such, she is enhanced (speed, strength, etc.), but without any legal standing as a human being or citizen of any country. She works as a courier for a secret organization. Her adventures involve both her job as well as her personal life as she struggles to find her place in a world that is largely fragmented, disintegrating around her, and regards her as less than human.

While the main theme of the story is society's approach to artificial people, Heinlein also explores various forms of human relationships, especially the concept of multiple partners engaged in a marriage with ever changing dyadic arrangements. Heinlein always seemed to come down on the side of more sex with more people as a positive improvement and he goes wild a bit with Friday. Along the way, he touches on genetic engineering as a profession, Earth governments fragmenting into smaller and smaller units, and rapid global transport. A faster than light drive is offered along with planetary colonization that features into the plot.

As they got older they went their separate ways. Macey to work in Thailand in the Peace Corps and Derek became a firefighter in Dallas, until tragedy strikes leaving him a shell of himself. He leaves Dallas to  go to San Amaro Island to escape life and help his uncle run a shack on the beach. When Macey returns to the US, shes asked by Dereks Mom to please check on him. Off she goes with the intention of spending 6 weeks in a tropical island. Thats when the plot thickens.
The story was engaging, with very complex characters. But what I appreciated most, was the authors ability to make us feel the grief Derek was experiencing and Maceys need to help Derek . A man she has been in love most of her life. All this making it at times a heartbreaking as well as heartwarming story.

When Oprah Winfrey's movie came out, and I learned that Disney had scrubbed all references to Christianity from a Christian children's book, I decided to check the book out and find out what the fuss was about.

I don't like the book much, and I don't understand why it gets glowing reviews. Compared to better children's books like Charlotte's Web and The Little Prince, it's not good at all. It's half-baked.

The characters are very thin. They all talk like each other, if you don't count the extra letters the author appends to Mrs. Which's words. We learn nearly nothing about them.

The plot could be written on the back of a business card. Don't read any more unless you're not afraid of spoilers: a man experimenting with space travel is trapped on a planet consumed by evil. Three angels take his son, daughter, and a friend to rescue him. Everyone escapes except the youngest son, who has been assimilated by evil. The daughter goes back, wakes him up with love, and brings him home.

That's the whole book. If it doesn't sound interesting or clever to you, that's because it isn't.

In addition to the poverty of the characters and plot, this book suffers from an excess of estrogen. It's a chick book, through and through. The characters are soppy and wimpy. Even the dad is kind of a woman. If you're a boy and you love Huckleberry Finn and Treasure Island, you will hate your parents for making you read this. The pajama boy from the old Obamacare ad would love this book.

The Christian content is minimal and misleading. If you're trying to get a kid to accept Jesus, this book won't help. ""God wants us to be nice, Jesus is basically no better than Da Vinci and Newton, yada yada yada."" Nothing about heaven, hell, repentance salvation, or the Holy Spirit.

I was bored by this book, because it's boring. It's not because it's a children's book. The other children's books I mentioned aren't boring to adults.

This might be a good read for girls, but I wouldn't bother a boy with it.",1521331200,3,hard time decid whether give two three star decid give three three mean okay would say book earn descript small margin enjoy kid kid told need read wrinkl time sound like drag dont know never took oprah winfrey movi came learn disney scrub refer christian christian child book decid check book find fuss dont like book much dont understand get glow review compar better child book like charlott web littl princ good halfbak charact thin talk like dont count extra letter author append mr which word learn nearli noth plot could written back busi card dont read unless your afraid spoiler man experi space travel trap planet consum evil three angel take son daughter friend rescu everyon escap except youngest son assimil evil daughter goe back wake love bring home that whole book doesnt sound interest clever that isnt addit poverti charact plot book suffer excess estrogen chick book charact soppi

The addictive writing is very nicely done and the author presents the most unreliable narrator in recent memory: Amber Reynolds. The plot is compelling and tense, it reminds me very much of one of my old favorites Before I Go to Sleep.

However, I didn't love the ending and I wish to the high heavens that the cast of characters were more complex and illuminated. I'm so done with superficial, twisty for twists' sake and I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT!!! (Insert teardrop here.)

Although this book is slower and overly detailed at times, it actually is more interesting because it is (loosely) based on two real women - Sarah and Angelina Grimke of Charleston, sisters from South Carolina who were early and staunch abolitionists and feminists in the 1820s-1840s. Other real people like Denmark Vesey, Lucretia Mott, John Greenleaf Whittier, etc. also are portrayed, along with their contributions to those turbulent times. Although half of the story is totally fictionalized  the half involving the young slave girl Hetty Handful and her mother Charlotte  the characters seem real and the actions seem consistent with the overall plot line. Slave vs. free, men vs. women, the role of religion in society, and when and how to speak up and fight injustice even at great risk to yourself and others - these universal quandaries are presented in a meaningful way.

30649,3656,2010,"Cassie Maddox is back. Fans of Tana Frenchs Dublin Murder Squad series will remember Maddox from book one in the series, In the Woods; she returns in the second book, The Likeness.

 Lexie Madison is found dead. Not only did she look like Detective Cassie Maddox, but her name  her entire character  was created and used by Cassie while working undercover. So, Cassie returns to undercover work to discover who Lexie was and who killed her. Lexie had been a graduate student at Trinity College, living in a large, rural manor house with four other graduate students. So, Cassie must slip back into her Lexie Madison character in a way that seamlessly meshes with her four housemates  quite a challenge as the five had been extraordinarily close.

 I loved The Likeness. Every time I read one of Tana Frenchs books, I remember how much I love her work. I do not know why, when I am not reading a French book, I seem to forget this, but when I return to French, I am once again captivated. There is something about her writing, something magical. Frenchs work is character weighted. Her characters are not the beautiful that we dream of becoming  they are ordinary, often troubled people, warts and all. But, French is a master at painting pictures with her words. Although the mysteries in the plots are intriguing and enticing, they are secondary to the world she creates. The pictures painted by her words seem to capture an extra layer  some sort of additional element, like an esoteric metaphysical layer, though not in a fantastical or sci-fi sense. It is an ineffable, albeit enticing, quality.

 And, like every other time that I have read Tana French, I now have the urge to read the entire Dublin Murder Squad series again, trying to bide time until a new French book is published.",1521331200,5,cassi maddox back fan tana french dublin murder squad seri rememb maddox book one seri wood return second book like lexi madison found dead look like detect cassi maddox name entir charact creat use cassi work undercov cassi return undercov work discov lexi kill lexi graduat student triniti colleg live larg rural manor hous four graduat student cassi must slip back lexi madison charact way seamlessli mesh four housem quit challeng five extraordinarili close love like everi time read one tana french book rememb much love work know read french book seem forget return french captiv someth write someth magic french work charact weight charact beauti dream becom ordinari often troubl peopl wart french master paint pictur word although mysteri plot intrigu entic secondari world creat pictur paint word seem captur extra layer sort addit element like esoter metaphys layer though fantast scifi sen ineff albeit entic qualiti like everi time read tana french urg read entir dublin murder squad seri
30650,3127,2152,"When Sue Grafton passed away about 3 months ago, and her family said they wouldn't be publishing the final 26th book of the Alphabet series, I was very disappointed. The world lost a fantastic writer, creator and author, not to mention human being and literary supporter. Grafton's books kept me sane for a decade... I immersed myself in the world of Kinsey Millhone and Santa Teresa, California. It's one of the most vividly drawn series of books I have ever found. I hadn't finished the last few books in the previous five years, so I bought the remaining three and started W is for Wasted last week. It was like coming home again... I really missed the characters and found the book quite good. It wasn't her best, certainly not the worst, but somewhere in that middle comfort zone. I can't wait to read X and Y, but I know they'll be the end. All good things have to embrace it sometimes...

In this story, we see the perspective of the dead investigator for whom Kinsey needs to re-trace some steps. How did he get himself killed? We also meet more of Kinsey's family -- always an exciting adventure. Throw in a great plot (and sense of humanity) in talking about the life of the homeless in a balanced way (not just throwing shade at them)... Grafton provides keen insight into the minds and thoughts of people stuck in a situation with nowhere to turn. I enjoyed this style, found myself with eyes opening wider, and laughed out loud way too many times.

It's a strong book in the series, and I think it shows a lot of the early reasons why I feel in love with the stories and characters. The only thing that pushed my buttons a little bit was an excessive amount of sideline backstories that really had nothing to do with the main stories... meaning 3 or 4 pages would be devoted to the history of some building that had little to do with the plot. Solid writing, interesting, but not connected. Not enough to be painful, but it crossed the line a few times where I found myself taking breaks at times I would normally just plow right through the story.

Kudos to another solid plot and re-introduction of past characters we hadn't seen in a long time.

30657,1406,1952,"I am tempted to add this title to my Southern fiction shelf. For a Pulitzer winner to be so careless with his facts is egregious. I got 200 pages or so in, and I found a glaring error. To be honest, I thought maybe it was me. I haven't taught the American Civil War in 8 years now; am I slipping? Because I could swear that the famous tidbit about a single battle killing more soldiers than the American Revolution, War of 1812, and war with Mexico all added together was about the battle of Antietam, yet here is Chernow, saying it's Shiloh.

This is when it's nice to have a physical library nearby. I rummaged on my Civil War shelves and plucked Battle Cry of Freedom, which he (rightly) appears to cite more often than anything except perhaps Grant's Memoirs, and I also grabbed McPherson's book on Antietam, and I double-checked. Yup. The reference is to to Antietam, not Shiloh.

At this point I wondered what else might be amiss. There's a Sherman quote that's supposed to be in a section in BCF, but the page number Chernow cites is actually in a section about the nurses of the ACW. Well, of course there are different editions, so page numbers may shift a bit, especially in a lengthy source. But I chose--randomly, from the citations at the back--3 other quotes from BCF, and read 8 or 10 pages before and after the page where the quote or fact is supposed to be located, and didn't find them. A more meticulous reader might have different results, but I am not running a courtroom prosecution; I am trying to decide if I now trust this author enough to believe him regarding other information. And I am not all that sure I do.

I have a lovely hardcover copy of this biography given me by one of my sons at Christmas, and I would hate to abandon it entirely at the 200 pp. mark; but I'll tell you one thing. I'm rereading Battle Cry of Freedom again before I turn another page of this biography. Because at the very least, this is a work to be read critically, rather than with innocent faith in its author. I like some of the analysis Chernow offers, but I would hate to see a newbie miseducated by using this title as an introduction to Grant or to the Civil War. As for me, I am going to strengthen my own foundation before I approach this tome, which must be read cautiously.",1521331200,2,tempt add titl southern fiction shelf pulitz winner careless fact egregi got 200 page found glare error honest thought mayb havent taught american civil war 8 year slip could swear famou tidbit singl battl kill soldier american revolut war 1812 war mexico ad togeth battl antietam yet chernow say shiloh nice physic librari nearbi rummag civil war shelv pluck battl cri freedom rightli appear cite often anyth except perhap grant memoir also grab mcpherson book antietam doublecheck yup refer antietam shiloh point wonder el might amiss there sherman quot that suppos section bcf page number chernow cite actual section nurs acw well cours differ edit page number may shift bit especi lengthi sourc choserandomli citat back3 quot bcf read 8 10 page page quot fact suppos locat didnt find meticul reader might differ result run courtroom prosecut tri decid trust author enough believ regard inform sure

30659,2682,459,"Reza Aslan is the author of a previous New York Times bestseller book, Zealot. In the books Introduction, he reminds us of his conversion from Islam to Christianity during his teens, only to then to on a subsequent life-long search for spirituality. This is the authors 5th book in that quest.

God - A Human History (2017 publication; 317 pages) is by no means intended to be an objective look at God. Instead, it provides us with a promise: This book is an appeal to stop foisting our human compulsions upon the divine, and to develop a more pantheistic view of God.  From there, the author brings us on a journey through time, as he examines how humanity has looked at God, starting with how Adam and Eve (representing Homo Sapiens), and even examining the concept of a soul.  where did the idea of the soul come from? The truthful answer is that we don't know. Ur, okay then. By the time we get to the New Testament era, we are already approaching the end of the book. Indeed, the official stated lenght of the book (more than 300 pages) is vastly misleading. The actual book itself is a mere 170 pages, with the rest devoted to a bibliography and then more than 100 pages of footnotes.

30660,368,3655,"3.5 STARS - This 9th book in the D.D Warren series has the experienced detective in the middle of a murder of a family and includes Flora Dane, a character from the previous book, Find Her, who becomes D.D's sidekick/confidential informant.

The addition of Flora's POV and different methods of getting information added an extra layer to the plot and funny banter between the seasoned police detective and the vigilante. But, there was often overlap between the two POVs which sometimes gave the story a 'didn't I just read about that?' feel for me.

This book picks up two years after 2016's Find Her (a wonderfully gritty read and one of my top reads of 2016). While readers don't have to read previous books in the series, I highly recommend reading Find Her to get Flora's back story which is important to understanding her character's development.

In Look For Me, Gardner gives her readers another twisty read and provides insight into the overburdened foster care system, how it has helped some kids and failed others. Gardner also addresses the issue of family, mistakes and healing and the addition of a teen's school essays on what 'The Perfect Family' means to her were touching and poignant.

This is a clever police procedural that kept me entertained, had some twists (even though I figured out the culprit) and an important social aspect. And while I can't say I was totally wowed this time out, I look forward to reading the next installment in this series.

30661,4675,480,"Sorry to inform you but the title is a spoiler because authors these days are so inconsiderate.

They Both Die at the End takes place in a world where when you get a call from Death-Cast, you are going to die in less than 24 hours. No one can escape death and if you get a call, that's it. The purpose of the warning is so those called can live their last day to the fullest, and tie up any loose ends. On the day of eighteen year old Mateo's call, he's shocked and alone. His father is in a coma and his only friend is a single mother who has already been through so much. When seventeen year old Rufus also gets a call, he's already made his peace with it after he lost his family months ago. With nothing else to do, both boys go onto the Last Friend app and meet each other. What follows is their last day where they slowly end up falling for each other.

This book is actually a lot like The Sun Is Also a Star, but for me, I enjoyed this one so much more. While I'm always a bit iffy on 24 hour romances where they start dropping the love bomb, I believed it a bit more this time. This book also happens to show POVs of other characters like in Nicola Yoon's. Every person that Mateo and Rufus bump into have their own story and I loved that here.

I really enjoyed the romance. For being such a short time period, it was kind of a slow burn? I don't get it either but I was obviously bummed out by the ending. At least I had a warning about it though! Mateo was such a sweet guy and he was honestly so relatable to me. Even if it was my last day alive, I'd probably have issues leaving my house too. Rufus was the classic tough guy but he was still nice under that; him and Mateo together were just adorable. Also good diversity!

As for this world where 100% accurate predictions of when people are going to die and then the system to tell them about it? It's sci-fi but it's never explained or gone into detail at all. For that, this book was really just a contemporary.

Weirdly, this book dragged sometimes. A lot of the book was just Mateo and Rufus walking around, talking and eating food. They have less than 24 hours left and they spend it just kind of hanging out and going back and forth around NYC. Get a move on it boys, you're literally both going to die soon.

While the ending didn't pack as much of an emotional punch as I thought it was going to, I still enjoyed this book a lot and I'm glad it exists. Normally I love a good ending but in this case, I'll just settle for the heartbreak.",1521331200,4,sorri inform titl spoiler author day inconsider die end take place world get call deathcast go die le 24 hour one escap death get call that purpos warn call live last day fullest tie loo end day eighteen year old mateo call he shock alon father coma friend singl mother alreadi much seventeen year old rufu also get call he alreadi made peac lost famili month ago noth el boy go onto last friend app meet follow last day slowli end fall book actual lot like sun also star enjoy one much im alway bit iffi 24 hour romanc start drop love bomb believ bit time book also happen show pov charact like nicola yoon everi person mateo rufu bump stori love realli enjoy romanc short time period kind slow burn dont get either obvious bum end least warn though mateo sweet guy

30665,692,1131,"Quick and readable, this book does a pretty decent job of presenting a teenage girl caught in the middle of a police shooting of an unarmed boy in the ghetto. Although there are a lot of stereotypes on all sides of the controversial issues, the story moves well and has a lot to say without being preachy. Complicated wrongs and rights are shown from several perspectives; there are no easy or pat answers. The violence comes in waves, and family loyalties (of all sorts) are tested to the max. I do wish, however, that an editor might have taken a stronger stance on some of the wasted, casual banter between characters that takes away from the developing tension. A little of that Fresh Prince kind of chit-chat is clever; too much begins to grate.

30668,1689,1721,"This series is just absolutely delightful. Compared to the Sweet Valley series that is edgy but filled with terrible role models; Nancy is a strong, capable womancompletely wholesome but able to hold her own. Nancy is a great role model, she can change her car's tire for herself. She solves mysteries and helps police capture a ring of thieves. Nancy was breaking barriers and portraying young women as capable and I love that!
There was a comment that stuck out to me in this book. When Nancy is locked in a closet, a caretaker of the property assumes the thieves are trying to trick him. As Nancy becomes frantic, she screams and the man makes a remark that a man couldn't make that much of a racket.

Rather than letting this comment wither her self-confidence, Nancy sets out after the thieves. Not only does she sneak into the thieves' hideout but she also solves the mystery of the old clock. Folks, this girl solves not just one but two mysteries in this book!

I was torn on what to rate this story. This book is fairly simplistic and easy to figure out. I mean, the title practically gives away the whole plot of the story. But, sometimes a rating should be about how eloquently a book is written. Sometimes a rating is about how the book makes you feel. This one makes me feel young again. Innocent. It takes me back to a time when a legit, good mystery was a missing clock containing the last will of a rich, old man.

Children of today may be surprised that Nancy doesn't have a cell phone. Also a sign that times have changed? $100,000 is presented as an extraordinary amount of money. In fact, in those days it was enough to support multiple beneficiaries, launch a singing career and obtain the best medical care that exists.

30670,3734,2645,"My 2nd time reading Lover Eternal by J.R. Ward and Im still in love with Rhage and Mary Luces story.

I actually listened to Lover Eternal, while I was at my day job (with ear buds of course). Jim Frangione definitely brings the BDB to life with his narration and his voice definitely keeps me company, when Im working on projects at my day job.

This time Rhage Hollywood is going to get his story in Lover Eternal and hes going to find his shellan. His shellan though is not one of them though. Mary Luce is a beautiful human woman who is dealing with her own problems. Problems that that she has been dealing with awhile. She is going to get thrown into the BDB world due to another side-character that comes into play in Lover Eternal. She wants to help this side-character, but things about him come to light to another character meeting him. (I don't want to give away any details)

Mary became a favorite female character in the BDB series, when I first read this book in 2009. Shes a strong character that definitely has gone through a lot and she still continues to live her life and help others, whenever she can assist someone. Shes an amazing human being and that is why shes perfect for Rhage because they are complete opposite and he needs someone to accept him for all he is in the story. Rhage battles a beast within that was given to him by the Scribe Virgin. Hes afraid the beast is going to hurt Mary though in the story. Even the BDB is scared of Rhage, when the beast comes out and that should tell you something about his full character. I loved him from the beginning because hes vulnerable, but a deadly character. Hes very gentle, when it comes to Mary though and hes very caring.

One of my favorite parts in Lover Eternal is when Rhage actually takes Mary on a date. Can you imagine one of the BDB characters being at a normal restaurant? Yup, very intimidating, but also very sexy too. These lethal warriors all have a soft side, especially with the women they end up with.

If you're thinking about reading the BDB series then read in order, please. Otherwise, youll miss out on some side-stories in the books from the other characters and youll miss out on some of the other BDB main stories. Believe me J.R. Ward builds up the storyline of certain characters in each book to prepare for the next book in the series. I love the main storylines and the side storylines because J.R. Ward is a master storyteller, which is why shes a favorite author who I always auto-buy.

J.R. Ward introduces Zsadist more into the story, which happens to be the next BDB book in the series. Zsadist is another BDB character that is scary, but hes going to open up a bit in Lover Eternal and then prepare for his story. I love this series!!!!

I give Lover Eternal 5 stars and highly recommend this book and the series to PNR readers out there.",1521331200,5,2nd time read lover etern jr ward im still love rhage mari luce stori actual listen lover etern day job ear bud cours jim frangion definit bring bdb life narrat voic definit keep compani im work project day job time rhage hollywood go get stori lover etern he go find shellan shellan though one though mari luce beauti human woman deal problem problem deal awhil go get thrown bdb world due anoth sidecharact come play lover etern want help sidecharact thing come light anoth charact meet dont want give away detail mari becam favorit femal charact bdb seri first read book 2009 she strong charact definit gone lot still continu live life help other whenev assist someon she amaz human she perfect rhage complet opposit need someon accept stori rhage battl beast within given scribe virgin he afraid beast go hurt mari though stori even bdb scare rhage beast come tell someth full charact love begin he vulner

30674,3734,415,"Ive decided Im going to re-read or listen in this case to the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. I have some catching up to do and the best way to start is rereading or actually listening to the previous BDB books before playing catch up. It helps, when you have Jim Frangione narrating the BDB books. His voice is memorizing and he makes my day job go by faster, when listening to the BDB men come to life.

How I have missed the BDB series. J.R. Ward has been a favorite of mine since 2009, when I first started reading her books. Ive neglected reading her books because of the blog becoming more of a job, instead of a hobby. Wellits back to enjoying reading again.  What better way to start then to dive back into some favorites!

First off, Wrath has been one of my book boyfriends for a while now. Ive missed Dark Lover and how he came into my life back in 2009. Im ecstatic to come back to his story and where the BDB started. Im also still jealous that Beth has him completely. *sigh*

If you enjoy a PNR series with lots of world building story telling and unforgettable characters youll enjoy this series. The first book alone builds up to what the BDB is exactly and what drama is playing out in Caldwell, NY. Its not sparkly vampires in this story. Nope. Instead, you get a band of warrior vampire brothers who are slowly, but surely finding their one true love or shellans in this case. They also are battling their own evil villains who hate their kind and they may be battling with themselves as well in the process. They are definitely intimidating characters.

Wrath is the Blind King who refuses to really take his rightful place at the throne. Hes the last full-blooded vampire and he is about to meet his match with Beth. Beth is about to turn into a vampire, but she needs Wraths help. Beth has no idea about the paranormal world and shes going to get thrown into the chaos.

There is instant chemistry between Wrath and Beth, when they first meet, but youll understand why the minute you start reading their story. Vampires have no control really and who can resist, such a dark and tall Vampire King like Wrath. I know I couldnt. He was very swoon worthy and sexy.

J.R. Ward also introduces the other vampires in the story too and believe me, Wrath is not my only favorite. I literally have several that became book boyfriends instantly, even in the first book. It gets worst, when they get their own stories. J.R. Ward is a master of writing addicting characters and stories too.

Nothing Left to Burn has been high on my wish list ever since I first heard about it, and as the buzz continued to build over these last few months my excitement did as well. I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy!

Now that I've read it I can definitely say it was well worth the wait. Nothing Left to Burn is fiery and enthralling...the kind of book that calls to be read in one sitting. It's about the secrets a person keeps and the lies they tell themselves to protect the ones they love. It's about falling in love - so hopelessly in love - that they begin to loose parts of themselves along the way. It's about growing up and taking responsibility, finding strength in the weakness. Basically, it's the kind of YA contemporary that reminds me just how much I love YA contemporary.

Nothing Left to Burn is set over a twenty-four hour period. At first I was worried about this characteristic. I wondered if the book would feel complete, if the story lines as well as the characters would be fleshed out. As per usual, however, my worrying was for nothing. Heather does an excellent job of using the twenty-four period to her advantage. I loved the quick nature of the book. The chapters were fast paced and to the point; however, they never felt incomplete. I was always satisfied with what I received. I also loved that she included flashbacks. It helped to drum up intrigue as well as suspense, especially when the hinted at event was broken up into several parts.

Nothing Left to Burn is told through Audrey's perspective. I found Audrey to be an interesting main character. I can't say I always loved her or fully stood behind her choices, but there was something about her that made her story so completely compelling. I wanted to know more about her. I wanted to know why she loved Brooks, why she seemed to be keeping her friends and family at such a distance, why she felt so guilty, and what exactly happened between her and her best friend's brother. I also loved how real she felt. She wasn't perfect. She was actually far from it, but over the course of the book, she aims to become a better person, to tell the truth, to take responsibility, and I admired that about her. I could even see parts of my high school self in her, and I feel that many others will be able to relate to her as well, especially when it comes to her toxic relationship with Brooks.

Talking about Brooks, he definitely wasn't the most likable love interest. There wasn't anything swoony about him, and I could never quite see the appeal to him even in his and Audrey's happy days. He was broody and dark, and the more I got to know him, the more I wanted Audrey to run. Like with Audrey, however, I was curious to learn more about him, and I will say I appreciated the overall role he played. It offered up a lot of interesting twists as well as introspections.

Nothing Left to Burn is a slow-burn read. It takes a while to get to the action, or the meat of the novel, but it was so worth it in my opinion. I loved getting to know the characters first, of really getting a feel for the California setting...Heather just did such a great job of building everything up. I also appreciated the focus on wildfires. As someone who doesn't live in an area impacted by them, I don't think too much about them. Therefore, it was eye-opening to see one through Audrey's eyes. It broke my heart to see what Audrey and her friends went through, and it's nutty to think about how much can change with just one fire.

Overall, Nothing Left to Burn is a unique, carefully crafted contemporary. Even though I finished it days ago, I'm still thinking about it, especially the ending. Gosh, it was twisty and ambiguous but I don't think it could've been more perfect. I can't wait to read more by Heather!",1521331200,5,45 noth left burn high wish list ever sinc first heard buzz continu build last month excit well couldnt wait get hand copi ive read definit say well worth wait noth left burn fieri enthrallingth kind book call read one sit secret person keep lie tell protect one love fall love hopelessli love begin loo part along way grow take respons find strength weak basic kind ya contemporari remind much love ya contemporari noth left burn set twentyfour hour period first worri characterist wonder book would feel complet stori line well charact would flesh per usual howev worri noth heather excel job use twentyfour period advantag love quick natur book chapter fast pace point howev never felt incomplet alway satisfi receiv also love includ flashback help drum intrigu well suspens especi hint event broken sever part noth left burn told audrey perspect found audrey interest main charact cant say alway love fulli stood behind choic

30679,2543,3717,"The story follows American ex-pats in Italy--namely three women over sixty (Camille, Julia, Susan) who spend their time exploring, eating, and sharing stories about their lives--and a younger forty-something ex-pat, Kit, who is an author and finds herself pregnant. She is friends with another author, Margaret.

The book is initially light reading, but then delves into dark issues like drug addiction, infidelity, grief and loss (the women are either separated or widowed, with the exception of Kit who is younger and has a boyfriend). Then one of the peripheral characters unexpectedly dies in the end in a particularly depressing way, which spoiled my enjoyment of the story--particularly as it looked like things were headed towards a full-on happy end, with one of the characters getting unexpectedly re-united with a long lost daughter, etc.

Overall, the story is character-driven rather than plot driven. As such, it is rather slow reading. However, if you salivate at the thought of living in Italy, you might enjoy all the descriptions. And if you're over sixty, you're likely to relate to the main characters, who are all sympathetic women. There wasn't an unlikeable character in the entire book.

30680,4675,3512,"Yikes. I'm really sorry but this is going to be a semi rant review. This book just had nothing good going for it.

In Regin of the Fallen Odessa is one of her kingdom's necromancers. Her job is to take spirits back from the Deadlands and bring them back to life, even though they are not as whole as they once were. They have to wear shrouds and cover their entire bodies; all it takes for one of the dead to turn into a monster, a shade, is for the living to look at their skin. Suddenly the dead start disappearing, and more shades are showing up and killing people. As it turns out, someone is controlling them and necromancy might be the reason for the kingdom's likely downfall.

Sounds cool right? That is what I thought but... nope. Everything in this book felt half-assed to me, honestly. The kingdom? What kingdom? I have no idea what anything looks like, I cannot picture anything. Some hills and a castle I guess. Maybe because the background wasn't as detailed or described you'd think the characters would stand out but again... nope. There are a bunch of side characters who some die, some don't but none of them matter. This book tries so hard to have an emotional connection to these people dying and their connection to the MC but it isn't good at all. All tell and no show and no side character was developed at all.

Odessa suffers a loss in the book pretty early on and for some reason, this book takes a bit of a break while she downs potion drugs to cope with it. While I thought the addition and talking about grief and addiction in a fantasy novel was actually pretty interesting and actually pretty much liked, after a while the book is like: ""Alright that's enough of this, let's go back to the actual story."" Either go all the way, or don't. Having the entire middle of the book be Odessa struggling with addiction then just curing it and never mentioning it again was insulting and just annoying. Cut out the middle section of the book and that pointless plotline and this story is already better.

The romance: uh no. There was a character that I really liked with Odessa, I thought that person was adorable and that they were perfect for each other. IF that had been the love interest, I would have liked this book at least a little better. Instead it seems like they are introduced and set up for a romance then they get shoved aside for some other one who literally came out of nowhere. The major thing that this book was advertised for was for all the lgbt and well. It's there but I didn't think it was all that good either.

As for Odessa, there was a bunch more telling and not showing how great she is at her job. They call her the Sparrow because she's so good at finding people in the Deadlands and bringing them back, or something. We never really get to see her be actually good at it though? She is no different than any of the other necromancers, except for everyone acting like she is.

The magic system: what? So there are different magics for different eye color. It seems like everyone has these powers but the only reason not everyone uses them is because they ""don't train for it"" which in itself is so lazy to me. I did enjoy the magic of beast mastery but that is probably just my love for my World of Warcraft character.

One last thing I have to get out, the ending and the villain. Not only was it obvious who the person pulling the strings was going to be, I kind of don't see how the reasoning behind their motivation was evil. Sure they wanted to kill a bunch of people but otherwise, didn't they just end up doing the same thing in the end anyway?

30681,3174,470,"The hype surrounding Victoria Schwab's novels is HUGE. Everyone on my Twitter feed appears to love her works and worships the ground upon which she walks. Maybe that's why I'm constantly feeling a little underwhelmed by her novels? I'm not sure.

Last year I read A Darker Shade of Magic and was massively disappointed. The characters felt like cardboard cutouts and the world-building was very much lacking. By the end of the story, I felt myself wondering, ""so what?"" Now, I did listen to the audiobook and the author herself was not pleased by the audiobook narrators. And many people have said the second book is much better... but it would take A LOT of convincing to get me to continue a series that I'm not in love with.

I do, however, believe in second chances. This is where This Savage Song comes in. A story concerning two kids, August Flynn and Kate Harker, who are on opposite sides of the war but come together to try to keep their city from falling apart. There's music, there's monsters... what's not to appreciate?

I did come to really like August and Kate as characters. August is a monster. And he struggles against his baser nature in order to hold on to some semblance of humanity. Kate had a good life, once. Before her father stepped back into her life and her mother was taken from her. To cope and in an attempt to impress her father, she pretends to be unemotional and cruel. They both suffer such angst but despite that, and despite their positions on opposite ends of the war, they form an unlikely friendship. (And thank the heavens that doesn't result in some kind of cheesy romance.)

As much as I liked the characters, however, I feel like This Savage Song suffered from the same lack of world-building that A Darker Shade of Magic did. For a good portion of this novel, I was confused by what was going on in Verity. And even at the end of the novel, I was somewhat confused about how Verity fit into the larger world. There's not a lot of explanation here and I really wanted to get it.

I also felt like the plot was a little bit cookie cutter. I definitely feel as though I've read something similar before and I wanted Schwab to just dig a little deeper and surprise me. I'm hoping she will when I read the sequel Our Dark Duet.

All in all, I'd give This Savage Song a solid three stars. Nothing to write home about but I really did like the characters.",1521331200,3,hype surround victoria schwab novel huge everyon twitter feed appear love work worship ground upon walk mayb that im constantli feel littl underwhelm novel im sure last year read darker shade magic massiv disappoint charact felt like cardboard cutout worldbuild much lack end stori felt wonder listen audiobook author plea audiobook narrat mani peopl said second book much better would take lot convinc get continu seri im love howev believ second chanc savag song come stori concern two kid august flynn kate harker opposit side war come togeth tri keep citi fall apart there music there monster what appreci come realli like august kate charact august monster struggl baser natur order hold semblanc human kate good life father step back life mother taken cope attempt impress father pretend unemot cruel suffer angst despit despit posit opposit end war form unlik friendship thank heaven doesnt result kind cheesi romanc much like charact howev feel like
30682,2224,3794,"Alyssa Cole artfully blends contemporary romance and subtle feminist manifesto in this delightful novel. Heroine Naledi is a STEM scientist and doctoral student in epidemiology, a cautious, penny-pinching product of the state foster care system who tries to balance her one close friendship with multiple jobs and endless coursework. Romance is not a priority, but then in saunters a gorgeous chocolate-skinned Adonis. He is a prince of a guy. No, a PRINCE of a guy, who, unbeknownst to Ledi,  is destined to rule, as his parents do currently, a  lush, mineral-rich South African country-- one that turns out to be the place of Naledi's birth. Of course, the road to true love is never easy.  Mistaken identities, lies, sexual attraction so intense it is suspect, and a villain whose family relation is no match for the greed in his heart, which threatens desecration in the name of progress --any or all of these issues could  derail what the Goddess has decreed: that these two will overcome the odds, not just in theory, but in reality. The novel is full of humor and boasts, in addition to the plot I've outlined above, a wonderfully diverse and imaginative collection of secondary characters.

The way that the author gradually reveals bits and pieces of the characters' lives adds both to the tension and the way that the story moves forward.

30685,1171,3429,"So. I have major beef with Maureen Johnson. I am a huge fan of her, and her writing, and her Shades of London series. I wait in anticipation for each and every new book to come out, and have been waiting year after year for the 4th in the series to be released, except it hasn't been and I don't even know if it ever will. I understand that she's been going through a lot, and of course, priority is herself and her health. My confusion lies in the fact that...well...she left that series unfinished and has now started writing a NEW series! Completely new series! And here's the other thing...it is very similar, in terms of plot and storyline, to the Shades of London series (boarding school, murder, mystery, group of kids trying to get the bad guy and solve a century old mystery?) (except we haven't encountered any ghosts...yet). So what does this mean for Shades of London? Is she done with that? I'd love if anyone who has or knows the answer would share it with me.

Now...to get on with this book review. I am a sucker for YA mysteries, and I do love Johnson's writing style, so obviously I immediately purchased this book. The mystery in this one is quite heartbreaking, involving a 3 year old child, which tugs at my heartstrings. This is a very intricately written book, with so many complex things happening and being built simultaneously. Moving between past and present, you are left in awe at how Johnson maneuvered all the events and put them together in a way that isn't too complicated for the readers to grasp, but still leaves you scratching your head.

The book starts with a prologue, where a student at Ellingham Academy is murdered. That scene is written so well that it made me think of The Lovely Bones and that suffocating scene where Susie gets brutally murdered. We then find out that the school's founder's wife and 3 year old daughter are also missing.

In present day, Stevie Bell enrolls into Ellingham Academy with one goal in mind - to solve the murder mystery that took place back in 1936. Now, I have to admit, I was rolling my eyes at this. A teenager is going to solve a mystery that went unsolved for almost a century. Really? Except, once I got into it and got to know the characters and got to know Stevie better, I didn't even care anymore. I suspended reality and decided to go with the flow, and was completely behind her, supporting her and rooting for her.

The book continues to alternate between past and present as the events of the past are slowly revealed and how the crime was never really solved and the child's body was never found, and how Stevie tries to put it all together in present time, while strange things start to happen mirroring the events of the past.

In the midst of all that, we get to know Stevie's flat mates, friends, family, her likes and dislikes, her insecurities, her love interest (of course) and all the usual high school drama. David is definitely an intriguing character, and I have to admit, I didn't see that one coming, although I should have probably expected it, but I didn't.

This whole book played out like a big set up for what's going to happen in book 2. It introduces you to the murder in the past, then sets you up with a new murder done in the same fashion as the one from the past with a poem by ""Truly Devious"" him/herself, then leaves you with, not one, but TWO killer cliffhangers so you basically have to bang your head against the wall in frustration as you wait until next year for the second installment.

I hope that this is one series Maureen Johnson will see through to the end.",1521331200,5,major beef maureen johnson huge fan write shade london seri wait anticip everi new book come wait year year 4th seri releas except hasnt dont even know ever understand she go lot cours prioriti health confus lie fact thatwellsh left seri unfinish start write new seri complet new seri here thingit similar term plot storylin shade london seri board school murder mysteri group kid tri get bad guy solv centuri old mysteri except havent encount ghostsyet mean shade london done id love anyon know answer would share nowto get book review sucker ya mysteri love johnson write style obvious immedi purchas book mysteri one quit heartbreak involv 3 year old child tug heartstr intric written book mani complex thing happen built simultan move past present left awe johnson maneuv event put togeth way isnt complic reader grasp still leav scratch head book start prologu student ellingham academi murder scene

In this book, the Earth is at war with its own environment.  Many of its major cities are already completely under water and many have died.  The best hope for the survival of humanity is to inhabit another planet, or as they decided for this book, Europa, one of Jupiters moons. Twenty Four candidates, between the ages of 16-19, from around the world are selected for specific strengths they inhabit to give the mission its best chance of success.  This number is narrowed down to the Final Six before the mission is to take place.  But all may not be as it seems, and one candidate in particular has many doubts about the true intentions of the space program for this mission.

This book was very interesting, if a bit predictable at times.  There was an adorable romance between two of the candidates and the  explanations about the mission and the condition of the Earth in this book were fascinating to me.  If you dig science fiction with particular interest in space travel I would definitely recommend this book.  It was left open for an obvious sequel.

30691,3732,1611,"I've been putting off reading Go Set a Watchman for some time, scared off somewhat by the controversy - and feeling just as awkward reviewing the book because of it. For those living under a literary rock, the furore began about 3 years ago when the book was announced, at first it all seemed straightforward, however closer to publication time rumours that the elderly Lee had been manipulated or railroaded into publishing the book surfaced. There was an investigation, however no wronging was found, but the rumours still persist after Lee's death, with close friends saying Lee often said throughout her life she didn't plan on publishing another book, that and the content of Go Set a Watchman seem contrary to To Kill a Mockingbird.

The reason this upsets my review is I feel context is important in a sequel - but in terms of this one I'm just going to try and look at the book as its own creature - as much this is possible given its a sequel to a major classic! There are a few SPOILERS later in the review I'll signal them.

Go Set a Watchman is set 10-20 years after the events of To Kill a Mockingbird and follows Jean Louse (Scout) as she returns to Maycomb to visit her father and others, the plot centres around her relationship with paramour Hank and a challenging discovery about her father Atticus.

The first thing I noticed about Watchman is that the lens is quite different from Mockingbird, where the latter used Scout's childish perspective to explore intense issues - Watchman is presented to us through Jean Louise's adult eyes, and thusly has a much different feel, more like a small slice in her life rather than the major event Mockingbird was.

The second thing I noticed was Watchman was a relatively quick and simple read, clocking in at less than 300 pages which relatively straightforward prose the book didn't gather much momentum again feeling like an important but not a particularly huge sequence of events.

As to the story I'll start with a spoiler free section - my main annoyance with the tale is its marred by a lack of direction, upon introduction one is introduced with a series of potential conflicts, Jean's reluctance to marry Hank, her frustration with Maycomb, her reluctance to come home and 'take care' of Atticus, its only about more than halfway that the ""true"" conflict starts and I'll go into more detail in the spoiler section but it feels unearned and completely surprising from a story-craft point of view. It created an interesting almost meta-twist on the story but in terms of narrative it almost felt like the novel was really just throwing a curve-ball.

So at this point I want to start going into SPOILER territory.

The other major controversy of Watchman was the take on racism. For those still under a literary rock the main thrust of Mockingbird is that Atticus Finch, Jean's father, defends a Black man in court stirring controversy but also being somewhat of a heroic icon. In Watchman the main tension is that Jean stumbles onto the very same man participating in anti-black political movements and taking some rather racist stances on issues. The point of the story is mean to throw Jean into true adult-hood where she stops idolizing Atticus as a pure hero and becomes her own person. The problem with the premise is that the story doesn't really flow around this - is sorta fits that the novel's beginning tensions seem to be around whether Jean will settle down marry Hank and look after her father, then the whole Atticus is actually racist issue appears, and the resolution is that Jean is now her own person because she knows Atticus is flawed? Not exactly what we were looking for. The whole thing resolves bizarrely too where the other characters act as if they are in on this development too, Atticus is like ""you can't idolize me so it's OK that I'm racist - story concluded right?""

I can kind of see a natural sequel in the topic in the sense that the narration is trying to present racial issues as cyclic at least on a political level, rather than individual battles that heroes fight (hence the plot revealing Atticus as racist kinda being meta) but the whole story just sits uncomfortably, the overall message is murky the conclusion unsatisfying.

Overall I'm glad I read the book finally, but I feel that it'll mostly just inspire me to reread Mockingbird again, and Watchman will likely sit as an uncomfortable sequel to the classic.",1521331200,3,ive put read go set watchman time scare somewhat controversi feel awkward review book live literari rock furor began 3 year ago book announc first seem straightforward howev closer public time rumour elderli lee manipul railroad publish book surfac investig howev wrong found rumour still persist lee death close friend say lee often said throughout life didnt plan publish anoth book content go set watchman seem contrari kill mockingbird reason upset review feel context import sequel term one im go tri look book creatur much possibl given sequel major classic spoiler later review ill signal go set watchman set 1020 year event kill mockingbird follow jean lous scout return maycomb visit father other plot centr around relationship paramour hank challeng discoveri father atticu first thing notic watchman len quit differ mockingbird latter use scout childish perspect explor intens issu watchman present u jean louis adult eye thusli much differ feel like small slice life rather major event mockingbird second thing notic watchman

30696,2296,3644,"*Original review on Goodreads & My Blog*

  Magnalia House was the sort of establishment where only wealthy, talented girls mastered their passion. It wasn't designed for girls who were lacking, for girls who were illegitimate daughters, and certainly not for girls who defied kings. I, of course, happen to be all three of those things.

This book was everything to me! I loved it so very much. Was it full of action and fighting. No, not really and guess what? That's okay!

I have to admit when I first saw the beautiful cover I knew I had to have it and then I read the summary and thought it sounded pretty good and I took the plunge. I just wish I would have gotten to it sooner!

Brienna is brought to Magnalia House when she was ten by her grandfather. Brienna couldn't think why he would take her from the orphanage and bring her to this school. She had no passion she could think of but he wanted to tuck her somewhere safe. So he told the Dowager that she could do a little bit of all the passions: art, music, dramatics, with and knowledge. Well, it didn't go very good. You're supposed to have one passion and study it for 7 years and see if you can find a patron who will get you started in the world.

Brienna ended up going through all of the passions and ending up with knowledge for her last 3 years. Her master was named Cartier and he was a mysterious man. When Brienna and Cartier started talking about Maevana, things started to change. Maevana has a long history of Queens and magic, but many years ago some of the things that helped with this magic was stolen away and the Queen killed along with any survivors. And the King that sits the throne to this day will kill of any rightful heir he might find. They are the Kavanagh family and there is one daughter in hiding, waiting to take back the throne.

When Cartier gives Brienna a book about the stone and some more of the history, she starts having visions. And when everyone leaves the school and she's left without a patron, she finally tells the Dowager about her visions. To Brienna's amazement, the Dowager said she needs to get her with a patron that no one can know about. She can't write to her friends, her grandfather, or Cartier and let them know where she has gone. For she is going to Maevana where is it very dangerous and get that stone to get the rightful Queen back on the throne.

Brienna's patron is a man with the last name of Jourdain ad he takes her on as his daughter. It's all very cloak and dagger stuff, but it must be done and he's very kind to her. And will protect her with his life and he did on the road back home.

  ""One thing you should know about me,"" he murmured, nudging his empty bowl aside. ""If anyone so much as threatens my family, I won't hesitate to kill them.""

  ""I am not even your blood,"" I whispered, surprised by his steely resolve. I had only been his adopted daughter for one day.

  ""You are part of my family. And when the thieves tore apart your things, threw your books in the mud, threatened you . . . I reacted.""

  I didn't know what to say, but I let my gaze remain on his face. My embers of defiance and irritation faded into darkness because the longer I looked upon him, my patron father, I sensed that something in his past made him this way.

  ""Again, I am sorry you had to see such of me,"" he said. ""I do not want you to fear me.""

  I reached across the table, offering my hand. If we were gong to succeed in whatever plans we authored, we would have to trust each other. Slowly, he set his fingers in mine; his were warm and tough, mine were cold and soft.

  ""I do not fear you,"" I whispered. ""Father.""

  He squeezed my fingers. ""Amadine.""

They had to change Brienna's name to keep her in disguise just in case. So he named her Amadine. And she also has a new brother named Luc. They were all very kind to her.

Luc works with Brienna to help her figure out how to get her visions of her ancestors back. She does get more visions and knows where the stone is and how to get it.

She finds out who her father is and that's not a great day.

Brienna also finds love in all of this madness and revelations she never would have believed. She finds hope and a family. It was just wonderful. But you have to read it for yourself to see how you feel as I am but one person.

Happy Reading!

30702,3820,3642,"I thought I would read a while, put it down, and attend to some other things. I ended up ditching my plans for the day and reading nonstop, late into the night until the last page was turned, reading the entire book in one sitting. This book was a departure from romantic comedies that I often read. It is a very sobering story and I never laughed once. I don't read horror genre usually but I felt very tense and horrified more than once. I felt a great sense of relief to see where the characters ended up. There is some bittersweet sadness mixed in with the satisfying ending.

""The Great Alone"" will have me thinking for days. It is not the kind of book you can quickly shake. In a way I feel I have a book hangover, as though I was so immersed that it will now take time to get the story out of my system. ""The Great Alone"" is fiction and yet there is a lot of truth between the lines. It took me back to 1974, the music, the news, the social climate of the times.

The story fooled me more than once. The plot twisted into ways I didn't expect. I am usually good at predicting what will happen but there was so much I never saw coming, and vice versa, I thought things were coming that never came. For instance, I was predicting Axel would come back into the story in a big way but he never did.

The title, ""The Great Alone"" refers to Alaska but I think it also refers to the heroine, Leni. Throughout the entire story she does not have a girlfriend her own age, she does not have a cat or dog, she is an only child in a family where you could make an a case that she was the only adult and the adults were the children. Her one true friendship, Matthew, is soon ripped away from her more than once. As I was reading I felt that I was rowing through a sea of troubles and finding only a few small islands of happiness here and there.",1521331200,5,thought would read put attend thing end ditch plan day read nonstop late night last page turn read entir book one sit book departur romant comedi often read sober stori never laugh dont read horror genr usual felt ten horrifi felt great sen relief see charact end bittersweet sad mix satisfi end great alon think day kind book quickli shake way feel book hangov though immers take time get stori system great alon fiction yet lot truth line took back 1974 music news social climat time stori fool plot twist way didnt expect usual good predict happen much never saw come vice versa thought thing come never came instanc predict axel would come back stori big way never titl great alon refer alaska think also refer heroin leni throughout entir stori girlfriend age cat dog child

30705,1846,3845,"The first thing to say about Terri Blackstock's If I Live is that if you haven't read books one and two of her ""If I Run"" series, read those first.  Jumping into If I Live without having read If I Run and If I'm Found is like starting a movie in the middle.  Eventually you'll figure out what's going on, but at first you'll be totally lost.

If you have read the first two books, you will be pleased to see the pieces coming together.  Casey Cox is on the run, suspect number one for her friend's murder.  What she knows, and hasn't been able to figure out how to reveal, is that her friend was killed by the same dirty cops who murdered her father a decade ago.

Changing her identity and moving around is only practical if she's not recognized.  Even though she's in another state altogether and taking great pains to keep her identity hidden, with her face all over the news, someone inevitably turns her in.  She is in a race against time to expose the corruption in the police department while avoiding the deadly fate of the corrupt cops' other victims.

Blackstock's pacing is breakneck; you won't be able to turn the pages fast enough.  Much of the plot and action are formulaic, especially if you're an avid reader of this type of fiction or viewer of police-themed TV dramas.  But that doesn't change the fact that Blackstock writes the genre well.  I enjoyed the way she brought in the faith element, with Casey ultimately becoming a Christian.  It's also nice to read an action-packed, gritty story that does not succumb to the use of profanity and sexual material.

This series is great for fans of gripping, fast-paced fiction, especially if you don't mind staying up most of the night (because you won't want to put it down).

30709,4940,3023,"Blurb......

In tough times, crime is one of the few things that still pays, but even criminals are having to make cut-backs. So for defence lawyer Mickey Haller, most of his new business is not about keeping people out of jail; it's about keeping a roof over their heads as the foreclosure business is booming. Lisa Trammel has been a client of Mickey's for eight months, and so far he's stopped the bank from taking her house. But now the bank's CEO has been found beaten to death - and Lisa is about to be indicted for murder...

I've put off reading any Michael Connelly books for a good while now. When I first started reading him, I was absolutely staggered by the quality of his writing. Once I had discovered him, I was like a pig rolling in mud, a dog with a big bone and the cat that had got the cream - all bundled up into one happy parcel of book-reading joy, if you get the picture. I had about 15 or so of his back catalogue to catch up on, which was fantastic reading for a fair few months. I absolutely loved Harry Bosch and couldn't get enough of him.

Unfortunately though, and in the words of The Righteous Brothers crooning ""You've Lost That Loving Feeling"" his last 3 or 4 books just haven't done it for me. Connelly had introduced a fresh character, Mickey Haller into his arsenal and whilst he was likeable enough and shared a parent and sometimes a storyline with Bosch, Connelly just didn't grab me in the way that he used to.

Picking up The Fifth Witness, more with a sense of apprehension than anticipation, I had already put him on notice that once this, The Drop and The Black Box (both on mount TBR) were done, if he didn't up his game, he was joining the ranks of ex-authors - those that I used to read......James Lee Burke, Jason Starr, James Ellroy, Robert Ferrigno to mention a few.

Well happy to report that this time around he nailed it for me. Haller, criminal defence lawyer extraordinaire defends Lisa Trammel on a murder charge. Lisa, an unsympathetic character relies upon Haller to convince a jury that she is innocent of killing Michael Bondurant, a bank executive who's actively engaged in trying to foreclose on her property.

Without going into mega detail, Connelly kept me hooked for over 550 pages...........the cops, the investigation, the trial, the prosecution, Haller's team, his ex-wife and daughter, the absent husband, foreclosures, bank fraud, dubious Hollywood agents and film-makers, East coast Mafiosi linked with West coast banking magnates and an LA biker gang. Plenty of ingredients in the pot, with a few blind alleys and red herrings; all blended together skilfully and served up.

These stories are evidence that God is very much in the life transforming business. The book is an encouragement to anyone wanting to make a new start in their life. There is a prayer at the end of the book to help readers who want to ask Jesus into their lives and surrender to God.

30727,4940,3380,"Synopsis:
In the 26th century mankind has spread through the galaxy, taking its religions and racial divisions out into the cold arena of space. While tensions exist and small dirty wars flare up every now and then, the UN Protectorate maintains an iron grasp on the new worlds, aided by its very own elite shock-troops; the Envoy Corps.
Meanwhile, what religion cannot guarantee technology has already delivered; when your consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack and routinely downloaded into a new body even death has become little more than an inconvenience. As long as you can afford a new body...
Ex-UN Envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before; it was a hazard of the job, but his last death was particularly brutal. Needlecast across light years of space, re-sleeved into a body in San Francisco on Old Earth and throw into the centre of a conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that has forgotten how to value life, he soon realises that the shell that blew a hole in his chest on Harlan's World was only the beginning of his problems...

Well it's fairly obvious now why I don't read much Science Fiction......I don't enjoy it! I signed up to a pulp-fiction group on Goodreads site, and Altered Carbon was the February reading choice as voted for by some of the members.
Hopes were raised on reading some of the praise on the back.......hardcore, hard-boiled, astonishing, blown away, adrenaline, slick hard-hitting, brilliant, commanding, exciting, addictive, intriguing and inventive,
If they ever want my contribution for future editions...........snore-fest, dull, grim, tedious, numbing, anaesthetising.............these will do for starters.
My main gripe would have to be that I just couldn't feel a connection or any empathy for Kovacs. Gosh he's in peril, will he survive this latest conflict? Yawn, who cares?
There were some decent bits in the book and to give Morgan his due he can write some decent action scenes and he has a vivid imagination, and he didn't bore me with too much technical jargon where I felt a degree in physics would have been helpful. I'm fairly certain that many, many people really enjoyed this, but sadly I wasn't one of them. I wouldn't say I actively loathed it, but it was a close run thing.
Highlight for me, turning the last page, reading the last paragraph.

30742,1890,3820,"Maria Shriver is totally correct in saying we are now living in times where more is needed.  Men, women and children across this nation and world are tired of the prevailing negativity, yearning for that which makes life good.  No, this is not a self-help book for Pollyanna-type persons but one in which one finds inner peace, purpose, love, and even joy.
Before each meditation in this book are quotations from notable people, those whove made a difference in the world but not been satisfied by external accolades.  Instead they're centered on the inner world that fuels their thoughts, words and deeds.  For example, Who you become as a person is up to you  up to your imagination, your will, your determination, your choices or What you think you become shared by the Buddha.  Then there are sections that we have heard before like pieces on love, honesty, forgiveness, and so on.  But what about the power within each of us for empathy, losing faith, not caring too much for what others think, living in a complaint-free zone periodically, a culture of care, the process of discernment, grieving, and so many more topics will catch your attention and invite you to ponder each one.
One is to consider meditating on it with prayer or just letting it be in ones consciousness until one is ready to move on to the next one.  This is not a book to be read cover to cover quickly; its full of wisdom and points of view that are right at different moments in life.

There's kind of a slow build up here, but once the author gets going, she really gets going!

Note that there's not a ton of world building here - most of it is socio-political as opposed to setting/world.  Readers should note that women don't really have the best status in this world.  Aside from one woman and one girl, who both kind of have to fight to be included in 'boy' things, most of the women in the book simply aren't important - even when they're important to the plot, they're kind of...just there.

But, I loved our characters and really wanted to know what had really happened to the two princes.

30754,1239,1198,"First, theres an obvious and often-stated difference between religion and spirituality. One can be religious and not spiritual (hence the Inquisition, the Rohingya, etc.), and one can be spiritual and not religious (the modern trend).

Richard Dawkins is clearly not religious, but it also appears he does not believe in a spiritual aspect to the universe, which is a much bigger step. And note that modern science basically reports that human beings only have access to about 4% of the information/energy/matter in the universe, so theres no doubt that theres room for a lot of things we cant prove in any logically admissible manner.

But Dawkins The God Delusion does stay true to its title and the strict definition of atheism, focusing only on the idea of a god and not venturing much of an opinion about spirituality. The problem is, however, that The God Delusion is a one-idea book that rattles for 420 pages of sometimes rational but usually strident rhetoric that does nothing more than reiterate the title.

Dawkins vents most of his considerable spleen on Christianity, the religion he and his readers are most familiar with, and has a grand old time eviscerating the contradictions and weaknesses of the Bible, but really, one example would have been plenty. And dismantling the argument that religion is a necessary foundation of morality also did not require 27 pages  10 would have done just fine.

That said, Dawkins case against a monotheistic god who looks down on Earth and occasionally intervenes is a very strong one, and his careful explication of how natural selection is much more than chance and random mutations at work takes care of the intelligent design argument pretty convincingly. (My favorite of the many points he makes is that if there was such a thing as intelligent design, why is nature so inefficient and filled with mistakes? Why do we have appendixes, for example, and why were we not designed to avoid cancer?)

All in all, though, The God Delusion isn't much of a book, and could have been neatly compressed into about a 75-page pamphlet (or maybe even less). Dawkins rants on and on in his mean-spirited way, and after way too many words, comes to the conclusion that his title is right on the money.

But theism is only part of the story of spirituality in a complex universe, and atheism is only part of the solution to the problem of how human beings fit in that universe, and what role spirituality plays, if any. Unfortunately, well have to read a different book than The God Delusion to delve much deeper than the familiar assaults on the many weaknesses of Christianity, and truly explore what spirituality means for human existence.",1521417600,2,first there obviou oftenst differ religion spiritu one religi spiritu henc inquisit rohingya etc one spiritu religi modern trend richard dawkin clearli religi also appear believ spiritu aspect univers much bigger step note modern scienc basic report human be access 4 informationenergymatt univers there doubt there room lot thing cant prove logic admiss manner dawkin god delus stay true titl strict definit atheism focus idea god ventur much opinion spiritu problem howev god delus oneidea book rattl 420 page sometim ration usual strident rhetor noth reiter titl dawkin vent consider spleen christian religion reader familiar grand old time eviscer contradict weak bibl realli one exampl would plenti dismantl argument religion necessari foundat moral also requir 27 page 10 would done fine said dawkin case monotheist god look earth occasion interven strong one care explic natur select much chanc random mutat work take care intellig design argument pretti convincingli favorit mani point make thing

30759,637,3830,"Let Me Lie is the third book from Clare Mackintosh. I devoured the suspense and twists in her first two books and was eager to dig into this latest.

Anna's parents both committed suicide within a year. On the one year anniversary of her mother's death, someone drops a card through her mail slot. Inside is a cryptic message ... ""Suicide? Think again.""

Anna always questioned their deaths. The bodies were never found and she can't believe her beloved mother would leave her. She decides to check in with the local constabulary on the case. Retired detective Murray Mackenzie is on the desk, now working in a civilian capacity. But old instincts die hard and he decides to look into the case further - on his own.

Murrary ended up being my favourite character. His personal story (his wife is mentally ill) was very well depicted and drew this reader in. Their relationship and how Murray copes were some of my favourite bits of the book. He's kind and intelligent as well as being a clever investigator. Anna's emotions and mental health are also explored. However, I wasn't as drawn to Anna, despite her being the lead character. I questioned some of her actions and decisions plot wise. But on the flip side, without some of those decisions, we wouldn't have as many  questions and avenues to explore. Mackintosh does give us lots of characters that may or may not have suspicious motives, keeping us guessing.

Interspersed are italicized chapters from, well, someone. These are deliberately vague and let the reader decide who it might be. In the beginning, these missives had me thinking things were going to unfold in a certain way (one I wasn't interested in). (Sorry, being deliberately obtuse. )As these entries continue, more and more detail is added, so that their identity becomes evident and the direction changes. Clues to the past are found in these narratives.

Let Me Lie was not as fast paced as the first two novels. I found the first part of the book to be a bit of a slow burn. Things do pick up in the last few chapters and one last final twist was a real 'gotcha'  I'll be watching for Mackintosh's next book.",1521417600,4,let lie third book clare mackintosh devour suspens twist first two book eager dig latest anna parent commit suicid within year one year anniversari mother death someon drop card mail slot insid cryptic messag suicid think anna alway question death bodi never found cant believ belov mother would leav decid check local constabulari case retir detect murray mackenzi desk work civilian capac old instinct die hard decid look case murrari end favourit charact person stori wife mental ill well depict drew reader relationship murray cope favourit bit book he kind intellig well clever investig anna emot mental health also explor howev wasnt drawn anna despit lead charact question action decis plot wise flip side without decis wouldnt mani question avenu explor mackintosh give u lot charact may may suspici motiv keep u guess interspers italic chapter well someon deliber vagu let reader decid might begin missiv think thing go unfold certain way one wasnt interest sorri deliber obtus entri continu detail ad

30765,469,844,"Sometimes I Lie intrigued me as soon as I read Amber Reynolds's three things. Unreliable narrators always fascinate me, and I was curious to see how Amber's story unraveled...why was she in a coma? And why didn't her husband love her anymore?

The end result? Sometimes I Lie took me on a wild, twist-laced ride from start to finish. So many times I thought I had figured everything out; however, Alice Feeney always managed to be prove me wrong, and I was so incredibly grateful for that! I love a book that keeps me on my toes.

Sometimes I Lie is a difficult book to describe. It's one of those mind-twisting thrillers you just need to experience for yourself, but I'll try my best here to describe the reasons why I loved it so much.

For one, Amber is an incredibly compelling character. It's easy to tell that there's something off about her, that there's more to her story than what she's willing to offer. She's never exactly likable ; however, I still became incredibly committed to her story. I wanted her to wake up from her coma. I wanted her to face her demons. I wanted her to fall in love with her husband once again. The quality I liked the most about Amber, however, was her compulsion to lie. It made for an incredibly interesting read, as mentioned above, and it was also interesting to think about why she lied, why she felt that it was so pertinent to surviving.

Sometimes I Lie is split divided into three time periods- journal entries from childhood, now, and before. I thought Alice did such a fantastic job of interweaving all three timelines. Each blended beautifully together, and I always loved/hated when something in one timeline contradicted something in another one. It consistently made me wonder which timeline was true. The plot in Sometimes I Lie is also incredibly fast paced. I read this book on a plane ride to Florida, and I don't think I've ever had a flight go faster. Nothing could distract me from what was at play here - the coma, the lying, the conniving sister, and the scapegoat husband. One aspect I particularly liked about the plot was how Alice utilized relationships to drive things forward. So many events/problems originated from the messed up, codependent relationship between Amber and her sister, and it was juicy to say the least.

I can't end this review without talking about the ending! Alice Feeney BLEW my mind! The last chapter was so incredibly out there, and I couldn't have loved it more. It wasn't the ending I had anticipated and I had to read it twice just to believe it; however, I don't think there could've been a better option.

Overall, Sometimes I Lie is a stellar debut! Now that I've read it I can definitely understand why it's receiving so much praise - it's a must read for sure!",1521417600,4,sometim lie intrigu soon read amber reynolds three thing unreli narrat alway fascin curiou see amber stori unraveledwhi coma didnt husband love anymor end result sometim lie took wild twistlac ride start finish mani time thought figur everyth howev alic feeney alway manag prove wrong incred grate love book keep toe sometim lie difficult book describ one mindtwist thriller need experi ill tri best describ reason love much one amber incred compel charact easi tell there someth there stori she will offer she never exactli likabl howev still becam incred commit stori want wake coma want face demon want fall love husband qualiti like amber howev compuls lie made incred interest read mention also interest think lie felt pertin surviv sometim lie split divid three time period journal entri childhood thought alic fantast job interweav three timelin blend beauti togeth alway lovedh someth one timelin contradict someth anoth one
30766,2326,106,"4.5 stars (rounded to 5 stars)

I passed on this book when it first came out, but after seeing all the 4 and 5 star ratings from my Goodreads friends I decided to give it a go.

It took a while for me to connect with the story. The first 80-100 pages were slow, and I wasn't sure if I was loving the rather off-putting protagonist enough to enjoy her tale. Eleanor is a young woman living in Glasgow who suffered a horrifically traumatic event at age 10 and spent the rest of her childhood in one foster home after another and finally in an orphanage. She makes the best of things and decides she is completely fine as a scar-faced independent person with an OK job and her weekend bottles of vodka. Who needs friends and family when you are completely fine without them, right?

Then she unexpectedly finds herself in a situation where she thinks she might like to impress somebody. As practice for this project she begins to expand her horizons just a bit and surprises herself by enjoying these new experiences. And when a normal work colleague doggedly coaxes her into a friendship, it is nothing like she has ever experienced before. That is when the book started reeling me in. After that point, I was totally hooked and read the vast majority of the book in 2 days. Unheard of for me.

Wow, Ms. Honeyman constructed a jewel with this debut effort. Her writing style is beautiful and most appealing. She also drops an interesting new (to me) word every 3 pages or so. I was reading a hardback so kept my online dictionary nearby at all times in order to see exactly what these cool words meant. I love learning new words. She also knew when to inject a dose of humor into this emotive story.

Watching Eleanor learn about all the wonderful human-y things she has been missing in life is profoundly moving. She is like a chrysalis, just waiting to bloom. I appreciated the author not going over the top with Eleanors journey; the characters and the story are portrayed very realistically, adding to the brilliance of the book.

I must throw in that I thought the scenes of Eleanor with Maria Temple were particularly well done.

This story is many things. It is both wrenching and full of heart. It is deeply touching. It is dark, yet inspiring. Most of all, it is one of those few books one reads that is truly unforgettable.

I received a free copy of this book on Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you Flatiron Books!

Seventeen-year-old Alice and her mother have spent most of Alices life on the road, always a step ahead of the uncanny bad luck biting at their heels. But when Alices grandmother, the reclusive author of a cult-classic book of pitch-dark fairy tales, dies alone on her estate, the Hazel Wood, Alice learns how bad her luck can really get: Her mother is stolen awayby a figure who claims to come from the Hinterland, the cruel supernatural world where her grandmothers stories are set. Alices only lead is the message her mother left behind: Stay away from the Hazel Wood.

Alice has long steered clear of her grandmothers cultish fans. But now she has no choice but to ally with classmate Ellery Finch, a Hinterland superfan who may have his own reasons for wanting to help her. To retrieve her mother, Alice must venture first to the Hazel Wood, then into the world where her grandmothers tales beganand where she might find out how her own story went so wrong.  Amazon.com

I love fairy tales and Im sure almost everyone in the world has heard the phrase once upon a time uttered once in their lifetime. But what if there were tales that were dark, like darker than the Grimms Brothers fairytales? Enter Tales From The Hinterland! A book about those very dark, violent, and haunting tales. And enter Alice, a girl who is trying to figure out who she is, why her and her mother keep having to leave their homes, and who kidnapped her mother. She, along with superfan Ellery, travel to find her grandmother, the author of Tales From The Hinterland, to discover the answer to those questions. So, lets start off by saying that this book was actually really great! I thought the characters were all very well developed, the plot was intriguing and very well developed, and the world building was fairly well done as well. I thought that I could see these fantastical places pretty clearly in my mind.

However, I did feel that the pacing was a bit off in some spots. The book definitely has its high and lows in terms of action, but for the most part its mostly action. I managed to read the book in a day. Thats how fast of a read it was for me. On the subject of action, I did think that the action bits (like fighting and high stakes scenes) were a bit muddied. They weren't that clear to me as a reader and I felt that if those scenes were expanded a bit more then they could have made a bit more sense. The language is also flowery in places and while it didn't bug me I know it does some people which is why I mention it.

Verdict: If you're looking for a dark and action-y read this February Id definitely choose this one! It was one of my favorite reads so far this January and I think that this will be a favorite read for a lot of other people too this year. Definitely one of the most anticipated reads that is worth the hype in my opinion.",1521417600,4,rate 455 genr ya fantasi recommend age 16 violenc blood languag page 368 author melissa albert amazon receiv free copi book netgalley exchang honest review thank flatiron book seventeenyearold alic mother spent alic life road alway step ahead uncanni bad luck bite heel alic grandmoth reclus author cultclass book pitchdark fairi tale die alon estat hazel wood alic learn bad luck realli get mother stolen awaybi figur claim come hinterland cruel supernatur world grandmoth stori set alic lead messag mother left behind stay away hazel wood alic long steer clear grandmoth cultish fan choic alli classmat elleri finch hinterland superfan may reason want help retriev mother alic must ventur first hazel wood world grandmoth tale beganand might find stori went wrong amazoncom love fairi tale im sure almost everyon world heard phrase upon time utter lifetim tale dark like darker grimm brother fairytal enter tale hinterland book dark violent haunt tale enter alic girl tri figur mother keep leav home kidnap mother along superfan elleri travel

Spoilers

This book wasn't a disaster, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't Kinsellas best work.

There were two plots. The first, which Ill call Project Surprise Me, had a light tone and themes of living in the moment and loving completely. It was instigated and propped up by an absurdly thoughtless and unprofessional claim made by their doctor. I think Sylvie and Dan took it way too seriously and lent it more credence than it deserved. It was a flimsy foundation for a plot that fizzled out in the end. The second plot, which Ill dub Protect Sylvie, was darker and dealt with pride, disillusionment, and the depths of grief. The two were incorporated well but not seamlessly. Project Surprise Me eventually got lost in Protect Sylvie.

I could predict the direction the story was going in, but I couldn't predict the details. The pace was a touch slow in the middle, and I believe some elements were unnecessary and could have been removedfor example, Mary ultimately served no purposebut then this relatively short book would have been even shorter, and short books aren't as lucrative.

The characters were okay, but I didn't fall in love with any of them. I sympathized with Sylvie somewhat, but I think that was more a product of the first-person narrative than any emotional connection I had with her. Other than blonde hair, we didn't have much in common, so it was difficult to relate. Also, Sylvies fear of heights was one of the unnecessary elements. I very much did not appreciate the demonstration of her courage at the end, because it killed the momentum of their reunion, which was more important than her irrelevant fear of heights.

Dan was nice, but his personal goals and motivations, other than to protect Sylvie from the truth because he thought it would break her, were enigmatic, and I didn't fully understand him as a character. I still have questions. Was his work situation resolved? He was going to do some major expansions, but Im not sure if he did or not. And Im not sure why he felt the need to in the first place. To compete with Sylvias dad in wealth? He never felt the need before, so why did he suddenly want to compete? Im not sure what changed.

And why, exactly, did he invite his old mates over for a sudden, random dinner party? Were led to believe it was so he could see Mary again and start an affair with her, but we learn that was unfounded, so why did Kinsella bother to include it? Did Dan think catching up with his past would make him feel less stressed about his present? Thats a bit hypocritical, since he was always telling Sylvie to stop dwelling on the past. I think it was said that he downloaded on Maryor at least he halfway wanted to, but never actually did, since Mary didn't know jack squat. As a result, her only purpose was to torture Sylvie, and that wasn't necessary, because Sylvie already suspected something fishy was going on behind her back.

I gotta say though, Mary handled the entire situation with eerie aplomb. Imagine a guy you dated over ten years ago suddenly tracked you down and, in the capacity of friendship, wanted to vent his problems to you. Wouldnt that be at least a little weird? Not for Mary; she acted like it was totally inconsequential.

As for the other characters, Mummy was a psycho who thrived on denial. Mrs. Kendrick was a willfully ignorant woman whose tastes included everything old-fashioned and antifeminist. However, she was willing, even determined, to learn and modernize, which endeared me to her. The twins were just there, and Prof. Russell and Owen were unnecessary (though I liked them a lot). I liked Tilda, but Toby was useless. And lastly, I was pleasantly surprised when Roberts attitude changed for the better.

But despite its flaws, Surprise Me is filled with heart and good intention. It contains a great message about marriage, love, and realistic expectations. Mechanically, the writing was skilled, and stylistically, it was classic Kinsella, with charming awkwardness and amusing inner dialogue tangents and fabrication. I eagerly await Kinsellas next book.

I rarely give 5 stars to a book and frankly the amount of trash that I have read over the past two years in this genre thrillers, detective stories this was gold to my mind. When do you ever find literature in a modern day thriller, murder story. There were many phrases that I found myself reading again simply because they were literature at it's best. Even more interesting were the characters and the development throughout the story. Apart from perhaps Girl On The Train, the vast majority are utterly boring either weak pathetic characters or Amazon women, that have no relation to anyone that thankfully you will ever meet. Yes I can see some readers points regarding the pretty obvious twists, especially if you enjoy this section of fiction. However, did it matter, did it truly spoil the story itself. Certainly there was enough action and I can forgive that simply because the writing and the actual fact that this was so very different to the 'run of the mill' books on the market today'. As for the black and white films, wasn't this also part of the story, for sure am older than many of you as I do remember many of them and frankly like many modern films, especially this years Oscars were far more exciting and better acted.

30797,3174,444,"I never read this as a child and in fact, I had never really heard of it until I joined the online bookish community a few years ago. I was surprised to learn that it was a children's classic that so many had read, a staple, and yet I had never seen and certainly never read it in school.

I was, and still am, fascinated by the previews for the movie so I thought I would give the beloved classic a try in book form first. I have to say, without much of the nostalgia that so many readers seem to have for this book, A Wrinkle in Time fell a little flat to me.

I read many children's classics growing up and even know, I still pick one up from time to time when I come across it. I loved Narnia, the Hobbit, the Harry Potter series (of course), Inkheart, and many others. But I feel like the stories that I find in each of those are much more complex than this first installment to the A Wrinkle in Time series. It seemed as though the concepts in this book are dumbed down even for a middle grade reader. The concepts of good and evil (describing the antagonist as IT), concepts of religion, and even the concept of love. It seemed to me that it read more as a script for a Disney movie (ha!) than anything else (and without the adorable animations).

I, for some reason, did not love Meg as the main character. I get that she is meant to be flawed but I wanted her to be stronger. Instead of constantly reaching for Calvin's hand (and really, he seemed to only exist for her), I wanted her to face up to her fears. Instead of relying on her father to save her or the Beasts, I wanted her to recognize her own strength. And in some ways, she does toward the end but the end was so rushed as to really give her time to truly shine.

I have to say that I did not fully understand the scientific (or magical? I'm not really clear on this) aspects of this book. How they really got from one place to another; or really what Whatsit, Who, and Which are. I think there were a lot of opportunities for world building that were not seized upon.

In the end, I did not form enough of a connection with the characters nor did I really understand enough of this universe to fully fall in love with A Wrinkle in Time.",1521417600,2,never read child fact never realli heard join onlin bookish commun year ago surpris learn child classic mani read stapl yet never seen certainli never read school still fascin preview movi thought would give belov classic tri book form first say without much nostalgia mani reader seem book wrinkl time fell littl flat read mani child classic grow even know still pick one time time come across love narnia hobbit harri potter seri cours inkheart mani other feel like stori find much complex first instal wrinkl time seri seem though concept book dumb even middl grade reader concept good evil describ antagonist concept religion even concept love seem read script disney movi ha anyth el without ador anim reason love meg main charact get meant flaw want stronger instead constantli reach calvin hand realli seem exist want face fear instead reli

However, this book was nothing like the movie at all. You still get the Owens Sisters, but the aunt's and actual magic played very little part.

For me, the writing style was very hard to get used to. It felt more like a young adult novel, versus the adult novel i was expecting. The pov changed more often than I would have liked, making it feel like it was all over the place. Despite being very descriptive, the overall writing felt choppy. There needed to be more chapter breaks. I mean this book was over 250+ pages, yet there were only 4 chapters...

Overall, this book was just an ok read. I'm glad I picked it up when it was on sale and gave it a chance.

30816,1613,1281,"""It's strange how you give the people you love so much power over you""

I am in the minority on this one, but this did not blow me away. I wanted to read this after seeing so many high ratings. I was expecting to love this book but ended up feeling meh about it. I actually wanted to hurry the book up in parts and other times found it to be a little repetitive. There were other times I wanted her to go into more detail or explain things more. One thing I had an issue with is that her family is described as survivalists who educated their children at home - many of which do not even have a birth certificate - but then they had many modern conveniences. Her father has a junkyard and a huge distrust of the government. Her Mother becomes a midwife at her husband's urging and makes tinctures and uses herbs to cure those in her family and in their community. I do realize that the family acquired the telephone due to her Mother's job as a mid-wife but then I wondered how they paid for everything. .

Tara grows up free or wild. She didn't bathe that often, didn't wash her hands after using the restroom, and is unaware of world history, and is quite comfortable living around bad odors and smells. She is abused by an older brother and no one seems to notice, intervene, or even care. They seem to be a reckless group - example: multiple car accidents, etc.

I had a hard time believing some of the information presented. Case in point the first car accident in the book, Tara's father offered to pay for the damaged tractor. Where did they get the money? Just how much does farm equipment cost? It's not cheap, I know that. Even if the farm equipment purchased is used it still must be pricey. Plus, the damage to their car would mean they would need to purchase another. Then the family has another car accident. More money, lots of injuries, possible need for another vehicle, etc. I am not saying that none of this happened, but I had a lot of questions about how things were paid for

Plus, this family seemed to be very accident prone, falling from surfaces, fires, head injuries. Was this because they were raised without any rules and became reckless, or did bad things just happen to them?

Tara does want a better life for herself. She does educate herself at home, so she can pass the test to get into College. College isn't cheap, nor are book, nor is housing or food. Again, I wondered how she paid for all of this. Plus, once she got to college, she didn't seem to mind that her roommates were upset with the smell in their home. Dirty dishes, not bathing, not having clean clothes. I get if this is the norm, in the home she grew up in but when faced with other's displeasure, I would think a smart girl like her would have taken the hint that being clean and living in a clean environment is the norm, not how she was raised. Plus, at home a young man even pointed out to her that her home smelled as did she.

There was a part of this book that I did enjoy. Tara's thirst for knowledge and teaching herself and gaining entrance to college without a formal education. I appreciated her struggles and having to learn how to ""learn"". She went on to achieve a lot in her life and it is impressive and commendable. Tara definitely was an under dog and I did root for her. She definitely changed her life and sought for better for herself. Even without a lot of support from her family, she found strength and kept going. This is what shined for me in this book with otherwise left me with questions. Who doesn't want to root for her? I did. Having said that, there were just too many questions raised why reading this. I don't care if someone is a survivalist, I would think one would still want their children to be safe and free of harm. The turning the blind eye to abuse was despicable. The family also had a lot of modern conveniences which did not gel with my idea of what a survivalist family would own or not own. But I am no expert on survivalist families. Her father clearly had some mental health issues and they contributed to his beliefs and possibly to their way of life. Yes, she suffered abuse. Yes, she grew up in a home with an untreated mentally ill parent, yes, it is all very sad but it was still not enough to make me enjoy the book.

What worked for me in this book was Tara's drive for a better life. How with very little support from her family, she went out on her own and obtained an education. I appreciated her drive and determination. Her book is well written and I realize this is her account of how she remembers things from her perspective. I just was left with questions hence the 3 star rating.

Again, in the minority with this one. Most love this book. It just wasn't for me.

30822,162,1327,"I have yet to read a bad Lee Child book.  Some have been better than others, but they have all been good.  'The Midnight Line' did nothing to change that.  Was it the best book in the series?  No.  Was it the worst?  No.  It fell somewhere a little below the middle.

As in 'Night School', other characters take center stage in many of the scenes.  It would be hard to have Reacher star in every scene here since things are happening in two widely separated places at the same time.  Also, if memory serves, in the older books Reacher carried the day himself (or with the help of soldiers from his old unit).  In the last few books, hes enlisted outsiders (if you will) to help him.  Reacher is the main character after all.  So, lets keep him the star of the show.

In earlier books, Child made Reachers inner monologues interesting.  You wouldnt think Reacher thinking through how he will handle a confrontation engaging, but it was.  However, he fell flat here with his monologue about the evolution of heroin to fentanyl.  It went on too long and roamed around a bit as if it wasn't sure where it was going.

And again, too, the climax seemed a bit rushed here and a bit too neatly packaged.  It never had the heart-racing tension earlier books  any good thriller in fact  should have.  Could Lee Child be losing his edge?  Hard to say.

Ill keep reading his books until that point is reached then Ill say a sad good-bye to Jack Reacher.",1521417600,3,yet read bad lee child book better other good midnight line noth chang best book seri worst fell somewher littl middl night school charact take center stage mani scene would hard reacher star everi scene sinc thing happen two wide separ place time also memori serv older book reacher carri day help soldier old unit last book he enlist outsid help reacher main charact let keep star show earlier book child made reacher inner monologu interest wouldnt think reacher think handl confront engag howev fell flat monologu evolut heroin fentanyl went long roam around bit wasnt sure go climax seem bit rush bit neatli packag never heartrac tension earlier book good thriller fact could lee child lose edg hard say ill keep read book point reach ill say sad goodby jack reacher

30825,2527,1431,"Clive Cussler is the original master of the non-stop action thriller, and his co-authors enable him to juggle many series simultaneously. I've always enjoyed the Oregon Files series with Juan Cabrillo and his crew. Because Juan is essentially a mercenary, no excuse needs to be made for how he gets into particular situations; he does it for money. But he still has a conscience and a love for humanity, and this is what keeps his stories interesting.

As is standard for all of Cussler's books -- regardless of the series -- the book starts with an historical backdrop, setting the stage for what is to come. I've always loved this about Cussler's books; the tactic makes the story much more believable. In ""Typhoon Fury,"" it's  not difficult to imagine that the Japanese might have developed a drug during World War II to create super soldiers.

In this 12th installment of the Oregon Files, Juan finds himself up against some pretty nasty characters who have more than one deadly trick up their sleeves. Juan usually outmatches his enemies fairly soundly, thanks to his fantastically outfitted ship and the wonders of the Magic Shop on board. In ""Typhoon Fury"" he encounters an enemy who sees through the Oregon's disguise and manages to get one step ahead of him on occasion.

Multiple angles and plot lines involving the recovery of stolen paintings, a South African mercernary, and underwater drone weapons almost -- almost -- make for a chaotic confluence of characters and plots, but somehow Cussler and co-author Boyd Morrison pull it together and it all shakes out.

30827,2563,3652,"The Bright sisters, Evelyn, Maggie, and Willa, live a peaceful life in the Pennsylvania countryside until the death of their baby brother Henry. Shortly after that, Papa packs the family up and moves them to Philadelphia, where he will become part of Uncle Fred's undertaking business. Many opportunities await the girls and their mother in Philadelphia, such as better schools, new friends, and opportunities to work outside the home. But World War I is crouching at the doorstep, and the Spanish influenza soon threatens to kill them all.

As Bright as Heaven kept my attention, but I cannot honestly say I enjoyed it. The pace moves along at a good clip, but the actual plot seems thready. It reads sort of like this: ""We moved to Philadelphia. The war continues. Willa caught the flu. Mama caught the flu. Willa lived. Mama died. A bunch of other people died."" Events are summed up like a news report, with very little dialogue or growth from the characters. The Bright girls, especially Maggie, give some decent introspection. Sometimes though, their voices seem a bit too immature and stilted--yes, at the same time--even for their ages.

The book seems like it will turn around at one point, when Maggie finds an orphaned baby boy her deceased brother's age and lies to keep him. But that never really comes to anything; again, the focus is on a ""camera lens"" type of storytelling. Other plot points get the same treatment. For example, one of the girls in little Willa's class is Gretchen Weiss, who is shunned because she is German-American. At first, Willa shuns her too, due to her age and innocence. But then Willa wonders if she should have played with and gotten to know Gretchen after all. Too bad the poor girl dies within mere pages of this introspection.

The action, what exists, does not pick up until about halfway through the book, and most of it is written in a dark and hopeless fashion. This isn't exactly a bad thing, considering the story's setting. I've seen a lot darker. But couple the endless stream of death, sickness, and mourning with a plodding pace, and...ugh. I've read Holocaust novels with more hope than this. You just get the sense that this family is going to plod on and on in darkness and ennui forever, with no end in sight.

Final verdict? Skip it. Try Karen Hesse's A Time of Angels for a more nuanced and developed look at the influenza epidemic of 1918.

30849,615,200,"Readers seem to either love or hate Dan Brown's books and I fall heavily into the former category. All of his novels have been fast-paced, action-packed explorations into countries, cultures, and hidden aspects of history that I would probably never get to experience otherwise. He brings the reader along as he explores the world and teaches us fascinating little factoids about the locations or object being discussed, making you feel like you are getting a deeper picture of what is happening within the story. In this way Origin is a typical Dan Brown, going even farther than normal to ask and answer questions that are at the heart of humanity: where do we come from? Where are we going?

Origin tackles some of the biggest and most controversial warring aspects of modern life: religion vs. science, classical vs. modern, new vs. old, fact vs. belief. While Brown veers heavily towards the belief in science and technology he also shows an appreciation and love for the classical and the artistic, showing links between the measured science of and the beauty and chaos of nature and life as we know it. I can't tell you too much more about the overall plot of the story without giving something away, but I will say that Brown offers up some compelling answers to the questions he presents, ones that make me both excited for and terrified for humanity's future.

My favorite aspect of the story, and one that sort of drives home the point of the ceaseless advancement of technology, is the fact that one of Robert Langdon's companions on this madcap journey is a virtual docent at the museum, one created by Edmond Kirsch himself. ""Winston"" is a key player in helping Langdon discover what Kirsch was going to reveal to the world and making sure that his revelations are released. While he doesn't physically travel with the human characters he's able to interact with them virtually and search through copious amounts of information to assist in a fraction of the time it would have taken Langdon. To be honest I'm not sure how they would have proceeded without him! That isn't to say that Winston is perfect, but you'll have to read/listen to the story to discover his downfalls.

I listened to this story as an audiobook and I think it was the perfect way to experience it. The narrator (Paul Michael) was excellent, keeping the tension tight and the action flowing while also never glossing over those delightful little facts Brown throws in to educate and entertain his readers. Michael also did a wonderful job of changing the accents between characters, given their various countries of origin, something I imagine can't be easy to do. The sound of his voice perfectly matched the Robert Langdon in my head so it was an all around enjoyable experience!

If you already enjoy Dan Brown books you are sure to enjoy Origin as well. If you've never read a book by Brown before this might be a great place to start as you don't have to have read the previous Langdon books to jump into this story. It's a thought-provoking yet quick read that keeps you entertained from cover to cover.",1521417600,4,reader seem either love hate dan brown book fall heavili former categori novel fastpac actionpack explor countri cultur hidden aspect histori would probabl never get experi otherwis bring reader along explor world teach u fascin littl factoid locat object discus make feel like get deeper pictur happen within stori way origin typic dan brown go even farther normal ask answer question heart human come go origin tackl biggest controversi war aspect modern life religion v scienc classic v modern new v old fact v belief brown veer heavili toward belief scienc technolog also show appreci love classic artist show link measur scienc beauti chao natur life know cant tell much overal plot stori without give someth away say brown offer compel answer question present one make excit terrifi human futur favorit aspect stori one sort drive home point ceaseless advanc technolog fact one robert langdon companion madcap journey virtual docent museum one creat edmond kirsch winston key player help langdon discov kirsch go reveal world
30850,709,3750,"About seventy-five thousand years ago, a volcanic eruption nearly ended the human race; almost everything died. About two thousand humans survived. As a result two chimpanzees have more genetic variation than all human beings combined; we differ by .01 of a percent. And this wasn't the only time the Earth was almost destroyed. Most everyone knows about how the dinosaurs disappeared.

So . . . why are we here? According to Michio Kaku Jupiter is our guardian angel, deflecting most asteroids, comets and other space clutter that could kill us. Earth is a Goldilocks Planet, not too hot, not cold, with an atmosphere that's no too dense and a magnetic field and an ozone layer that deflects ultra-violet rays from frying us alive.  How many Goldilocks planets are there in our galaxy? Possibly hundreds of thousands, but a lot depends on plane old luck. We have been lucky. Just last year an asteroid came within a thirty-some thousand miles of the Earth.

How do scientists know which planets are like us? They can't see them, but the Kepler and the Hubble telescopes look at the brightness of certain stars; when they dim in a certain way, it means something is blocking their light. Scientists are able to tell the size of the planet by how much it affects the light from its host star.

Kaku discusses the effect of Obama's decision to shut down the shuttle program. He was hoping private business would get involved, and they have in a big way. Elon Musk has a billion dollar contract to provision the international space station, and he has delivered supplies several times. He is planning a Mars landing by 2024; he already has a rocket whose booster can land on an ocean platform. This rocket can take us to Mars. NASA isn't quite that optimistic. They plan to put a man on Mars by 2035, using the moon as a base.

Stephen J. Hawking maintains that if we can make it through the next two hundred years and not destroy ourselves via terrorism and nuclear war or pollution we can evolve in respect to reaching the stars. A Russian scientist, Nikolai Kardashev has created a scale of civilizations: Type I uses all of the energy from the light provided by its star; Type II uses all the energy the sun produces (think fusion); Type III uses all the energy in the entire galaxy. Obviously we're not even a Type I civilization since we don't use all the sunlight the Sun provides. We're about a 0.7 civilization.

If we survive it's pretty much a given we'll have a settlement on Mars by mid century and we'll start terraforming it. It's too cold up there with hardly any atmosphere. We can warm it up by injecting methane into its atmosphere.

Scientists have also discovered several moons of Jupiter and Saturn that have water. We can use them as bases to move beyond the solar system.

Eventually, Kaku gets around to his pet theory, string theory which mathematically combines Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum theory. It consists of ten dimensions, but we can't prove it until we become a Type III civilization. We can chip away at it, using the Super colliders, the CERN in Switzerland which has already discovered the Higgs Boson particle, an indicator of dark matter, and a new one being built by the Japanese in conjunction with other countries. String theory will help us discover what's inside a Worm Hole, whether or not we can pass through one without being crushed. Supposedly if we can pass through a Worm Hole, we can take a short cut to the opposite side of the galaxy. String Theory also allows for the possibility of multi universes. Kaku talks about universes popping in and out of existence. We're looking for the stable ones. Why? Because other galaxies are racing away from us at exponential speed. If this keeps up, we're in for a Big Freeze and everything will die. String theory allows for us to move not just to another star, but another universe. If you're the paranoid type, stop worrying.

30852,4501,1563,"Eleanor was right. She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something. ~ Park

I saw this book at my local library while I was browsing and it caught my attention, as Ive liked other books by Rainbow Rowell that Ive read.  This one was no exception.

-- New Girl at School --

The year is 1986.  Eleanor is the new girl at school with flaming red hair and clothes that, shall we say, are out of the norm.  Shes the school outcast and is bullied at school because shes a big girl who wears very odd, patchwork outfits.  The first part of the novel takes place on the bus, where she sits next to Park, a somewhat geeky boy who s half-Caucasian and half Korean.
Days pass and they never talk to each other nor look at each other until one day Park notices that Eleanor is discretely reading his comics over his shoulder.  He begins slipping her comics without saying a word, with her always returning them the next day.

-- A Relationship Develops --

From this point, their relationship begins to develop slowly, with Park creating mixed tapes for Eleanor (remember mixed tapes?) and them slowing starting to talk to each other about comics and music. Eleanor is convinced that a boy like Park couldn't possibly be interested in her but is surprised when they move to the hand-holding stage.

They both begin to look forward to the bus ride to and from school - the only time they get to spend together.  I really loved watching the slow and tender relationship develop between them as they learned more and more about each other.  Eleanor wavers between joy at having Park in her life and disbelief that he could actually be interested in her.  Its no surprise that, because of her home life, her self-confidence is lacking.

-- Eleanors Home Life --

Sitting and talking with Park is the one bright spot in Eleanors life because shes having kind of a tough time of it.  Not only is she bullied at school (someone continues to write obscene messages on her school notebooks) but she lives at home with an abusive, controlling stepfather who barely provides for the kids needs, hence the patchwork and mens clothes she has to wear to school.  She and her siblings pretty much live in fear and poverty.

While at home, all her time is spent in her room, trying desperately to stay out of her stepfathers way, who for some reason, seems to have it out for her.  Park is unaware of her situation as its something that Eleanor never speaks of.

-- Parks Home Life --

Parks world couldn't be more different than Eleanors. His family is loving and supportive, though his father is somewhat challenged by Parks individuality, especially the day he shows up at the breakfast table wearing eyeliner (his father didn't speak to him for days afterward).

But it was apparent that both of his parents loved him.  They also ended up welcoming Eleanor into their home, though his mother (a beautician) didn't much care for her initially.  It was nice to see how Parks family warmed to Eleanor especially when they began to understand that she had a difficult home life.

-- The Characters --

I really fell in love with these two characters who were both shy, awkward outcasts and it was fun to observe their initial hostility to each other turned first into friendship then into something deeper as they became more and more comfortable with each other.

I felt the author did an excellent job of capturing that specialness and newness that we go through when experiencing love for the first time.  I enjoyed the format of the book in which the author switches back and forth, via extremely short chapters, between Parks and Eleanors point of view, so we really go to know each of the characters and observe what it is that makes them tick.

I can't believe how much I adored both Eleanor and Park, how much I've cheered for them to get together, and how much I just... couldn't put the book down, really.

-- My Verdict --

Though this was a touching coming of age story of a sweet first love, it was also heartbreaking in places as we experience first-hand the horrendous home life that Eleanor had to endure. In this way, its the kind of story thatll make you laugh and cry, and I did find myself tearing up on a few occasions while reading.  This is a story that flows well with believable and likable characters.

I thought this book was beautifully written with authentic situations and dialog. For instance, the description of the first time they held hands was amazing  the intensity that both of them experienced from just this simple act. This scene brought me back to my teen years, as I recalled these exact same feelings the first time I held hands with someone I truly cared about.
I think that many people will be able to relate to the experiences that these two teens go through (I also remember making mix tapes for my first crush!).  I felt that the relationship between Eleanor and Park built slowly, realistically and naturally.  This is a story that flowed well with believable characters.

Eleanor & Park is a love story but with many other real-life issues thrown in.  While the romance between them was sweet and I loved watching them fall more and more in love with each other, the story also dealt with several not-so-sweet themes such as bullying, child abuse, child neglect, social pressures and negative self-image.  So while its a tender story of two teens falling in love, theres also plenty of conflict from the outside world which made the book heart-wrenching in parts.

But I ended up loving every part of the story and am so glad I came across it. This book was fantastic... I loved how the point of view changed between the two main characters, I loved the drama, the slowly blossoming romance, the secrets they had, and the exciting indescribable feelings they experienced as their love blossomed. This story had just enough soft and hard to make it perfect  it was neither too mushy nor too gritty.

The writing was entertaining and sweet, with both humor and heartbreak.  There's something to be said about how an author manages to get me to read a 322-page novel in nearly one sitting.

30854,301,3869,"Census was a quick and somewhat unusual read  but, I liked it very much.

The story begins with an unnamed man digging his own grave. The man, a widower, a former surgeon is gravely ill and his concern is not what is about to happen to him but, what will happen to his son who has Down's Syndrome.

The man decides to take a job as a census taker for the government and father and son take to the road in an unnamed country, visiting various counties (A-Z). Each chapter is short and represents one of the counties along their journey and the individuals they meet, on what will be their final journey together.

This story is a brief meditation on loss, love and the meaning of life. It was written as a tribute to the author's brother who died of complications of Down's Syndrome at the age of 24.",1521417600,4,censu quick somewhat unusu read like much stori begin unnam man dig grave man widow former surgeon grave ill concern happen happen son down syndrom man decid take job censu taker govern father son take road unnam countri visit variou counti az chapter short repres one counti along journey individu meet final journey togeth stori brief medit loss love mean life written tribut author brother die complic down syndrom age 24

30858,823,3794,"I loved the concept of this story and the fact that when Prince Thabiso meets Naledi for the first time at her place of employment, she mistakes him for her new co-worker and puts him to work. Can you imagine a Prince catering an event himself? Picture dropped dishes, spilled drinks, and fondue a la blaze. Needless to say, he does not make a great first impression on Naledi. However, when he moves in next door to her, she finds herself warming up to him. She has no idea that his name isn't really Jamal (the kid who was supposed to show up for work that day) or the fact that he is the Prince that those annoying emails keep mentioning.

I found both of the characters both strong and annoying. You see, Naledi is always at the ready to write someone off. She has this hang-up from being a foster kid that everyone will leave you. So, she continues to hold Thabiso at arms length. Prince Thabiso goes to New York with good intentions but quickly takes a turn into creepersville. I mean, instead of correcting Naledi when she mistakes him for someone else, or even later when they are neighbors, he continues on with the ruse. He even goes so far as to sleep with her when she has no idea what his real name is. That really bothered me. So, I wasn't overly upset when Naledi freaked out and gave him the boot.

A Princess in Theory was a delightful read. I thought the story would just be the two of them building a connection under false pretenses but that was only half the story.

30859,1119,3790,"I'm shamefully behind on my Lisa Kleypas historical series (The Hathaways might have been my last reads from her?) but have good memories of them, so when I got a chance to read Hello Stranger with a doctor heroine and spy hero, I jumped at the chance. Though the fact that the heroine has a male name (neatly explained early on, but still...) continued to throw me for a loop all book long, this book was a lot of fun to read. Kleypas gave our hero some of the best lines ever, like

The first moment I saw you, I knew you were my share of the world. Ive always loved you. If I could choose my fate, Id never be parted from you. Acushlapulse of my heart, breath of my soultheres nothing on this earth more fair and fine than you. Your shadow on the ground is sunlight to me.

(that one while he was literally on death's door!) and

He knows that where you're concerned, Ihavea preference. Guiding her past the palms, he opened the service door and took her to the landing of a servants stairwell...

...Preference, Garrett repeated cautiously. What does that mean? You prefer me to what?

As they stopped in a corner, Ethans head and broad shoulders were silhouetted in the faint glow of a sconce on the opposite wall. She began to tremble as he stood over her, big and dark, his nearness awakening a pulse of high music in her.

I prefer you to everything, he said gruffly, and bent to take her mouth with his.

I mean, really. Could anyone possibly mount a defense against lines like that, I ask you?

I resisted the urge to look up 1870s medical procedures and knowledge, so I have no idea how accurate they are in the book, but OMG Kleypas absolutely used them to great effect here. Between the major medical emergency and the suspense drama--along with the aforementioned swoony bits--this one was nearly impossible to put down.

Thank goodness it was a Sunday ;)

Hello Stranger is the fourth book in The Ravenels series, but worked just fine as a standalone--the Ravenels were very much secondary characters for most of the book; West, who hasn't had a book yet, has the biggest role here...and OMG, does his part have me sitting on the edge of my seat, waiting for his book to come out?

Yes. Yes, it does.

30861,823,1131,"I really liked that the author wrote Starr the way she did. Shes spent just about half her life in some private school surrounded by rich white kids. Then at the end of the day she goes back home to Garden Heights. The way she was able to balance the two worlds was insane. Shed go from talking all prim and proper to her friends at school, to going home and letting her hair down. She never seemed to let those two worlds mesh until at least halfway through the story. Her own boyfriend of over a year had never been to her house. So, I really liked getting to see Starr blend her two worlds together. Heck, the two lives she was living was starting to feel suffocating.

This was seriously a book with a full cast of amazing characters. Everyone from Mr. Reuben who would give kids a free meal for bringing in their report cards, to Mr. Lewis who you thought was just a cranky old man, but was there when stuff hit the fan, Uncle Carlos who ends up in a tough situation when his niece is the witness in the car that his colleague pulled over, even Foty Ounce with his shopping cart full of belongings made an impression on me. All the characters in the story stood out and had a voice of their own. What I liked most about them was their sense of community though. They may all bicker and grumble about the other being nosy, they all seemed to pool together when it mattered most.

I really applaud the author for writing this story. In a time where it seems like theres this great divide, I think its wonderful that she wrote a story about something so monumental. I won't begin to try to understand what Starr and her family go through on a day-to-day basis. However, I can honestly say that seeing all these police brutalities happening lately is extremely upsetting. While I cant claim to know what its like to be Starr, the author was able to shed some light on the matter for me. I couldn't imagine being scared of someone whos sworn to serve and protect me. The fear of always thinking that they will shoot you if you accidentally sneeze or twitch. I just cant grasp what that is like. Sad thing is, this isn't even a fictitious story about unicorns and rainbows, this happens every day in the real world. So, the fact that the author was able to give me the same emotions that Starr had throughout the novel speaks volumes. Its so hard to wrap my head around this story and be able to write a coherent review.

30864,1567,3644,"Important parts of Brienna's life are mysteries to her. She lost her mother at an early age and was taken in by her maternal grandfather. Every time she asked him about her father, she was told the man wasn't worth her knowing and that ended the conversation. When she turned ten, she was taken to Magnalia House, a training institute for what are called passions, of which there are five: Art, wit, music, dramatics and knowledge. She struggled through four painful years, failing at all but one of them. In her fourteenth year, Brianna was paired with Cartier, the handsome, but enigmatic teacher of knowledge. While her sister students all have seven years to perfect their passion, she only has three and must share Cartier with another student, Ciri. This leaves her both confused and, at times, intimidated. Even so, when it comes time for all the girls to be paired with a patron and receive their passion cloak, she believes she might still be chosen. When she's the only one not selected and Cartier goes on a summer long leave, Brienna feels abandoned and fears she'll never fulfill her destiny.
  However, her destiny not only finds her in the form of a disgraced lord who fled Maevana during a horrific conflict twenty-five years before, she learns, as time goes on, how many friends she has, what her role in the retaking of the Maevanian throne will be and who her father really is.
  Cleverly woven together, this first book by the author is a slower read than many I've enjoyed recently, but that's because of the richness of the details, the characters and the story line.

30871,3724,3786,"Why has it taken me so long to read Caroline Linden? This was my first read by her, and it was so fun. I loved the heroine, Sophie. She's a feisty, smart, independent woman. She is the granddaughter of a viscount, so she has aristocratic ties, but her father was a disowned second son, and once she's orphaned, her granddad dumps her at boarding school. (At school, she makes friends with two ladies, Eliza & Georgiana, who are mostly minor secondary characters in this book, but they'll get their own stories in the series.) Sophie used to watch her father gamble, and she's good at math/counting cards, so when she has to make it on her own she becomes a professional gambler.

The hero, Jack, is a great match for her. He starts off as the stereotypical stuffy duke who's trying to wrangle his worthless brother, but she softens him and really brings out his sensitivities and emotions. Also, it's clear that he likes that she's strong and smart, and he doesn't stifle her or try to change her.

During an evening barbecue it appears 8 year old Daisy Mason vanishes into thin air. Even her own parents can't recall the last time they saw her that evening. Now DI Adam Fawley and his team need to put the puzzle pieces together in order to save Daisy before it's too late.

In interviewing the parents DI Fawley can't help but to wonder what they may be hiding. An uninterested mother who seems to care more about her appearance than the fact that her daughter has gone missing and a father who comes across as cold and hostile. All the while keeping his eye on Daisy's brother Leo who seems withdrawn and scared but of who?

30878,72,2677,"In this sequel to When Have All the Girls Gone, which you don't have to have read to read this book, Krentz turns her attention to the brooding brother Cabot Sutter.  When Virginia Troy walks into his new detective agency that he runs with his brothers and his father because she
recognizes the name Salinas as being that of the sheriff who rescued her all those years ago from the fire set by cult leader Quinton Zane.  Cabot and his two brothers were also rescued by Anton Salinas and later he became their foster father and raised them when no family members came forward to claim them.

Virginia suspects something suspicious about the death of her friend, artist Hannah Brewster a former cult member, who it is believed to have jumped over the cliff near her home on one of the San Juan islands after torching her house.  What makes her doubt this is that she sent her a camera with one picture on it: the last painting of a series of paintings she had been doing of the night the compound went up.  In this last picture is a clear picture of Quinton Zane wherein the others the face was hazy. There's also a picture of a modern car in the background.  Salinas and his boys believe that Zane faked his death and is alive and well but haven't been able to find him.  This could be a major clue.

Meanwhile, someone at Nightwatch, a small tech company, is searching Victoria's home and art gallery business for a missing key that will lead to Quinton Zane's missing money.  His ex-lover with whom he designed an app for the company, which he took credit for, is found dead at the gallery in the locked storeroom where Hannah's paintings of the fire are stored.

While Virginia and Cabot are looking for a connection between Nightwatch and Quinton Zane, the two become quite close. Neither one has a great track record in the relationship department.  Virginia has anxiety attacks and the last time she had sex she had one during it which imploded the relationship.  I love that this book doesn't make their first time together perfect with him ""curing"" her right off of the bat or anything.  Or that just because they get close and form a relationship it doesn't stop him from getting up at 1:35 in the morning.  Virginia and Cabot are great characters too that I came to really care about.

Emika Chen's life is a constant struggle. Since her father's death she's been drowning in deby as she tries to pay off the medical expenses and gambling debts he left behind. Emika is a stellar hacker but thanks to the arrest on her record she can't get any jobs near a computer. Instead she works as a bounty hunter tracking down petty criminals who do stupid things like gamble on Warcross and hustling to stay ahead of the competition.

Warcross is the one place where Emika can relax. The virtual reality game is a diversion, a competition, and place where Emika can remember what she loves: coding. With an eviction notice hanging over her head it's also a place where she can take a big risk and hack into the opening game of the Warcross Championship to try and steal an item and erase her debt.

When the hack goes spectacularly wrong Emika thinks she's heading for a swift arrest and jail. But instead she is whisked to Tokyo where she meets Warcross's creator--eccentric young millionaire Hideo Tanaka--and is hired to work as a spy and bounty hunter tracking down a hacker who is threatening the Warcross world.

To cover for her real mission Emika is placed in the Wardraft and becomes part of the Championship. Winning the Championship and finding the hacker could change Emika's life forever. Getting too close to the truth could change the world of Warcross and beyond forever in Warcross (2017) by Marie Lu.

Warcross is the first book in Lu's Warcross duology.

Lu has once again created a well-realized and fascinating world where virtual reality and augmented reality are plausibly integrated into everyday life. This plot-driven story is fast-paced and full of action as Emika's investigation brings her into Tokyo as well as the virtual worlds of Warcross and the Dark World typically inhabited by criminals and hackers.

The coding and gameplay aspects of Warcross can feel convenient while more than one twist will leave readers wondering if a few frank conversations between characters could have avoided many of the novel's main conflicts. The tension of the championship and the urgency of Emika's investigation to track down the Warcross hacker, known only as Zero, raise the stakes enough to detract from these holes in the plot.

Warcross is filled with distinct characters from a variety of backgrounds ranging from poor Hammie, a champion Thief in Warcross who uses her winnings to support her family to DJ Ren--a champion Warcross player/French DJ sensation--and Phoenix Rider team captain Asher who is American and flies through Warcross games in virtual reality while navigating the real world in a high tech wheelchair. While Emika is immediately drawn into the camaraderie and competition surrounding Warcross (not to mention drawn to enticing and mysterious Hideo) she knows she can't let her guard down if she wants to identify Zero and beat the other bounty hunters to the prize.

The high stakes of the Warcross championship blend well with the larger mystery of finding Zero. The excitement and twists, particularly in the second half of the novel, work well to draw readers in and help them ignore the fact that a few frank conversations could solve most if not all of Emika and Hideo's problems.

This duology starter is filled with inventive world building, top notch characters, and provocative questions about who (if anyone) deserves a redemption arc. Warcross draws readers in with action and gaming, but where it really shines is with the thoughtful meditation on what separates heroes from villains in a world that is anything but black and white. Recommended.

After speaking with their doctor, Sylvie and Dan Winter are daunted by the prospect of sixty-eight more years of marriage. Realizing they know each other too well, Sylvie starts Project Surprise Me in an effort to keep them interested in one another. Most of their surprises go awry, though, and lead to unintentional surpriseslike long-kept secrets with the power to shatter the bubble of ignorance in which theyve been functioning. What starts as an effort to save their marriagemight actually destroy it.
_____

Spoilers

This book wasn't a disaster, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't Kinsellas best work.

There were two plots. The first, which Ill call Project Surprise Me, had a light tone and themes of living in the moment and loving completely. It was instigated and propped up by an absurdly thoughtless and unprofessional claim made by their doctor. I think Sylvie and Dan took it way too seriously and lent it more credence than it deserved. It was a flimsy foundation for a plot that fizzled out in the end. The second plot, which Ill dub Protect Sylvie, was darker and dealt with pride, disillusionment, and the depths of grief. The two were incorporated well but not seamlessly. Project Surprise Me eventually got lost in Protect Sylvie.

I could predict the direction the story was going in, but I couldn't predict the details. The pace was a touch slow in the middle, and I believe some elements were unnecessary and could have been removedfor example, Mary ultimately served no purposebut then this relatively short book would have been even shorter, and short books aren't as lucrative.

The characters were okay, but I didn't fall in love with any of them. I sympathized with Sylvie somewhat, but I think that was more a product of the first-person narrative than any emotional connection I had with her. Other than blonde hair, we didn't have much in common, so it was difficult to relate. Also, Sylvies fear of heights was one of the unnecessary elements. I very much did not appreciate the demonstration of her courage at the end, because it killed the momentum of their reunion, which was more important than her irrelevant fear of heights.

Dan was nice, but his personal goals and motivations, other than to protect Sylvie from the truth because he thought it would break her, were enigmatic, and I didn't fully understand him as a character. I still have questions. Was his work situation resolved? He was going to do some major expansions, but Im not sure if he did or not. And Im not sure why he felt the need to in the first place. To compete with Sylvias dad in wealth? He never felt the need before, so why did he suddenly want to compete? Im not sure what changed.

And why, exactly, did he invite his old mates over for a sudden, random dinner party? Were led to believe it was so he could see Mary again and start an affair with her, but we learn that was unfounded, so why did Kinsella bother to include it? Did Dan think catching up with his past would make him feel less stressed about his present? Thats a bit hypocritical, since he was always telling Sylvie to stop dwelling on the past. I think it was said that he downloaded on Maryor at least he halfway wanted to, but never actually did, since Mary didn't know jack squat. As a result, her only purpose was to torture Sylvie, and that wasn't necessary, because Sylvie already suspected something fishy was going on behind her back.

I gotta say though, Mary handled the entire situation with eerie aplomb. Imagine a guy you dated over ten years ago suddenly tracked you down and, in the capacity of friendship, wanted to vent his problems to you. Wouldnt that be at least a little weird? Not for Mary; she acted like it was totally inconsequential.

As for the other characters, Mummy was a psycho who thrived on denial. Mrs. Kendrick was a willfully ignorant woman whose tastes included everything old-fashioned and antifeminist. However, she was willing, even determined, to learn and modernize, which endeared me to her. The twins were just there, and Prof. Russell and Owen were unnecessary (though I liked them a lot). I liked Tilda, but Toby was useless. And lastly, I was pleasantly surprised when Roberts attitude changed for the better.

But despite its flaws, Surprise Me is filled with heart and good intention. It contains a great message about marriage, love, and realistic expectations. Mechanically, the writing was skilled, and stylistically, it was classic Kinsella, with charming awkwardness and amusing inner dialogue tangents and fabrication. I eagerly await Kinsellas next book.

30889,3174,1284,"The Bear and the Nightingale has been calling my name for so long now! I was so excited to pick this up and I'm so glad I did!

The Bear and the Nightingale weaves Russian fairy tales together (with some creative license) to tell a story about a wild and brave young girl who can see and talk to spirits. Vasya grows up in a time when women were either wives and mothers or nuns; she doesn't want to be either as she would rather spend her time roaming the forests or riding her horse. But her stepmother and the village priest have other ideas for Vasya, calling her a witch and trying (in vain) to make her change her ways. In fact, the priest instills fear into the heart of the other villagers so that they stop giving to their household spirits that have protected them for so long. Vasya knows that this can bring nothing good as the spirits come to her offering up warnings of the Bear.

What did I love about The Bear and the Nightingale?
1. Vasya as the FMC. She will not be constrained by societal rules and stand by while harm comes to her family or to the villagers. She is so brave!
2. The fairy tale portion. It was fascinating to learn more about these household and forest spirits that the villagers relied on for so long. I loved that bit of culture.
3. The pacing. It takes time to build but not a bad way. This is a slow burn novel that that hints at the trouble to come and I adored it.
4. The Winter King. He was fascinating! And I hope he makes an appearance in future novels.
5. The commentary on societal roles and religion. Katherine Arden deftly weaves in this commentary and provides for food for thought.

30894,410,2679,"Robert Harris new novel, Munich, is notable for arguing that rather than appeaser of Hitler, Chamberlain in fact recognized Great Britains weak military position, that Britain required time to build up its land and air forces, that the British people lacked the appetite for another, far worse all out world war, especially over what many saw as an entirely continental dispute, and that Britain, should war come, could do little to thwart Hitlers conquest of Czechoslovakia. It also has the virtue of reminding us that resistance to Hitler existed, in particular during the very time of the Munich diplomatic efforts to forestall war, in the form of the Oster Conspiracy (Generalmajor Hans Oster, deputy head of Abwer, German military intelligence).

Munich takes place during the four days surrounding the signing of the Munich Agreement, September 29, 1938, as Chamberlain and the British government prepare to fly to Germany. Number 10 Downing Street buzzes with activity as PM Chamberlain and staff prepare for their upcoming meeting with Hitler, Mussolini, and Daladier (France). Among the diplomatic service staff is a junior member, Hugh Legat, a fictional character. He expects to help assemble materials for the meeting and then remain in London. To his, and others, surprise, he finds himself selected to accompany the mission. The request for his presence comes through secret communication from Berlin. Another young junior diplomat, Paul von Hartmann, of the German Foreign Ministry, through his highly placed cohorts has originated the request. Paul and Hugh both attended Oxford, Balliol College. They spent a summer together in the Munich area early in the decade in the company of a young German girl, girlfriend to Paul but who also had a brief romance with Hugh. Paul wants Hugh in Munich so that he might deliver to him a report attributable to Hitler stating in no uncertain terms the dictators intentions not only in Czechoslovakia but also going forward into the 1940s. Paul and his fellow conspirators believe that if they can prevent Chamberlain and the others from signing a peaceful transfer of the Sudetenland to the Nazis, the Wehrmacht will overthrow Hitler and thus save Germany from, as they see it, an unwinnable war. The novel focuses on the machinations and dangers faced by Paul in getting the message into Pauls hands, and thereafter from Paul to Chamberlain. This message serves to reinforce the idea that while Chamberlain might be viewed as an appeaser, he might also be seen as a cool-eyed realist.

Harris, a master at suspense and detailed research, excels at recreating the atmosphere surrounding one of the most important meetings in 20th century world history, from the landscape and architecture of Munich, to the food consumed, down to the operation of the diplomatic corps. He also paints intriguing portraits of not only the key historical figures, but to many lost in the dust of history. While you may or may not agree with Harris revised portrayal of Chamberlain, youll surely enjoy the ride provided by his very good historical suspense novel.",1521417600,4,robert harri new novel munich notabl argu rather appeas hitler chamberlain fact recogn great britain weak militari posit britain requir time build land air forc british peopl lack appetit anoth far wors world war especi mani saw entir continent disput britain war come could littl thwart hitler conquest czechoslovakia also virtu remind u resist hitler exist particular time munich diplomat effort forestal war form oster conspiraci generalmajor han oster deputi head abwer german militari intellig munich take place four day surround sign munich agreement septemb 29 1938 chamberlain british govern prepar fli germani number 10 down street buzz activ pm chamberlain staff prepar upcom meet hitler mussolini daladi franc among diplomat servic staff junior member hugh legat fiction charact expect help assembl materi meet remain london other surpris find select accompani mission request presenc come secret commun berlin anoth young junior diplomat paul von hartmann german foreign ministri highli place cohort origin request paul hugh attend oxford balliol colleg spent summer togeth munich area earli decad compani young german girl girlfriend paul also brief romanc hugh paul want hugh munich might deliv report attribut

30897,1935,1709,"It's been more than a decade since I last readGood Omens (full title: Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch), the collaboration between Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Since then, I've come to know and deeply love the work of Terry Pratchett, and I've become more familiar with the work of Neil Gaiman (who, at the time I last readGood Omens, had only had a couple of novels published). That's made it a perfect excuse to revisit the book, and see how it holds up as a work by two of my favorite writers.

The answer: it holds up perfectly and then some, representing some wonderful union of the best of each author's sensibilities, and creating something wonderful in the process.

Nominally,Good Omensis the story of the Apocalypse, brought about by the birth of the Antichrist. But, in typical Pratchett style, from the get-go, there are reversals and oddities, from the way that the Antichrist is raised by a family who doesn't know what their child is and simply raises him normally to the way the book follows an angel and demon as they attempt to prevent all of this from happening. And through it all, Gaiman fleshes out the mythology and imagination of the piece, playing off of Pratchett's wry social commentary and gleeful silliness.

The result is, first of all, laugh-out-loud, consistently, constantly hilarious, from page one until the end. From a hellhound trapped in the form of a little dog to four bikers who nominate themselves as the followers of the four true Horsemen of the Apocalypse (bikers who have given themselves names like Grievous Bodily Harm, Really Cool People, Things Not Working Even When You've Given Them a Good Thumping, and more), from the wonderful banter between a group of children to the running gag about how every cassette left in a car gradually turns intoQueen's Greatest Hits, Pratchett and Gaiman stuff the book with jokes and silliness, ranging from the profound to the absurd and childish. (My favorite throwaway gag involves a group of ducks that's uniquely attuned to international politics because of all the ""covert"" meetings that happen at their pond.)

But what makesGood Omensgreat isn't the sly parodies ofThe Omen or the wonderful silliness. No, what makes it great is what makes so many Pratchett (and Gaiman, to a different extent) books great: the way it uses the plot to get to something more meaningful and profound. What begins as a book about the end of the world becomes a study of human frailty (the demon Crowley's thoughts about how human nature trumps anything he can ever come up with ring as true today as they did when the novel was first written), but also what makes life worth living. As with so many books by these two, the final confrontation doesn't come down to an action sequence - it comes down to ideas, to optimism (or hope, perhaps) in the face of defeat and cynicism. That's something both men have always been fascinated by, and always brought out in their work - that the world, and people, are so often horrible, and yet there is something magical and essential about life that's impossible to ignore. ThatGood Omensturns that into the text of the novel is what gives is a surprising punch that hits home, even more than any scene of Crowley driving his rapidly disintegrating car or enjoying (what I assume is Gaiman's work) the novel's inspired modernization of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse (and, in one case, one that has never changed, and never will).

It truly is the best case scenario for a collaboration - something that brings out the best aspects in both authors and plays them off of each other, creating something that feels like both of their work and yet feels totally of its own piece. It's funny, it's imaginative, it's profound, and it makes you feel better about the world, even while we recognize the pain of it all. In other words, it's typically brilliant Pratchett and Gaiman in every way.",1521417600,5,decad sinc last readgood omen full titl good omen nice accur propheci agn nutter witch collabor neil gaiman terri pratchett sinc ive come know deepli love work terri pratchett ive becom familiar work neil gaiman time last readgood omen coupl novel publish that made perfect excus revisit book see hold work two favorit writer answer hold perfectli repres wonder union best author sensibl creat someth wonder process nominallygood omensi stori apocalyps brought birth antichrist typic pratchett style getgo revers odditi way antichrist rais famili doesnt know child simpli rais normal way book follow angel demon attempt prevent happen gaiman flesh mytholog imagin piec play pratchett wri social commentari gleeful silli result first laughoutloud consist constantli hilari page one end hellhound trap form littl dog four biker nomin follow four true horseman apocalyps biker given name like grievou bodili harm realli cool peopl thing work even youv given good thump wonder banter group child

That said, Weir is a genius when it comes to infusing his stories with enough science and realism to ring true without veering into geek-out territory and being too complicated for the average reader. It entertains while still ringing possible. It's a fine line and Weir walks it like a master.
The story takes place in a future where humanity has built a city on the moon and one of its inhabitants suddenly finds herself as part of a plot that places her city in danger. The pacing is spectacular, with events happening in appropriately fast or contemplative sequences.

30903,2193,3734,"Thanks to Little Brown for a review copy of this book!

This was a slow burn for me. While I enjoyed the story it seemed to take forever for it to really get rolling. I also found some of it confusing, there were a ton of names and quick switching of who was being talked about.

The book focuses on the lives of preschool mothers in the Upper East Side of NYC. One of their own Phillipa Lye has a certain aura of mystery around her. Secrets of her past begin to be dragged up when a criminal investigation begins.

This is an interesting look at 21st century culture. It looks at many different aspects of relationships including love, hate, and betrayal.

30904,3174,914,"Strange the Dreamer is my second chance read for Laini Taylor. I read DOSAB last year or the year before that and just did not love it. I remember thinking the characters and the premise were really interesting but the prose just dragged on and on... and it was much the same with Strange the Dreamer. I'm thinking Laini Taylor is just not for me.

Strange the Dreamer follows Lazlo Strange, a nobody librarian, as he searches for the mysterious Unseen City, or the city of Weep as it has come to be known. Everyone thinks that Lazlo is a little... well, strange with his head up in the clouds. But one day, Lazlo's dream to find the Unseen City comes true and off he sets on an adventure that even he could not have dreamed of.

I was really hooked for the first third of the novel as we get to know Lazlo, this mysterious city, and some of the legends that surround it. I was also intrigued by Sarai and her friends, locked in their tower, for lack of a better phrase. But as you get into the middle of this novel, the pace really starts to drag and I started to lose interest. I was just not overly invested in the romance bits.

Then the last fifty pages or so start to pick up as we figure out bits of Lazlo's past (he's an orphan) and the climax of the story hits its peak. I wasn't exactly surprised by the reveal but it was fairly interesting watching the reactions of the people around him. But then, in the last 15 pages or so, Lazlo makes a fairly stupid decision and gets himself in real trouble.

This story held of a lot of promise and there's a lot of interesting bits here to explore but then once again Laini Taylor's writing style had me feeling like I was wading through molasses. Her prose is exquisite but she gets overly bogged down in the details and pretty metaphors. This novel could have been a lot shorter without really losing much.

Not sure if I would really give this a 2 or a 3 star rating...",1521417600,3,strang dreamer second chanc read laini taylor read dosab last year year love rememb think charact premis realli interest prose drag much strang dreamer im think laini taylor strang dreamer follow lazlo strang nobodi librarian search mysteri unseen citi citi weep come known everyon think lazlo littl well strang head cloud one day lazlo dream find unseen citi come true set adventur even could dream realli hook first third novel get know lazlo mysteri citi legend surround also intrigu sarai friend lock tower lack better phrase get middl novel pace realli start drag start lose interest overli invest romanc bit last fifti page start pick figur bit lazlo past he orphan climax stori hit peak wasnt exactli surpris reveal fairli interest watch reaction peopl around last 15 page lazlo make fairli stupid decis get real troubl stori held lot promis there lot
30905,4675,914,"This book was super neat! I've said it before but Laini Taylor is on a different level than the rest of us.

Strange the Dreamer is about a young librarian named Lazlo desperately wanting to find a mysterious lost city called Weep. Suddenly he gets a once in a lifetime chance to fulfill his lifelong dream with a legendary man called the Godslayer. Weep is as mysterious as ever and what is his actual purpose for being allowed to go there, and who is the blue-skinned goddess who suddenly appears in his dreams?

This book is insane, in a really good way. Most of the book is long and has flowerly descriptions of this world that is created and it's really thorough. There were also a lot of characters and it felt like they were all fleshed out as well, especially the godslayer and those closest to him. Everything that happens is honestly just so damn cool, I couldn't believe I was reading (or rather listening because audiobook). Just when I thought things couldn't get any better (or more sad and heartbreaking), they did. My emotions were played the whole time and I'm still just trying to figure everything out.

I shouldn't have been surprised because you know, the Daughter of Smoke & Bone series was wild.

The one thing that lowers the rating a little for me personally is that it felt like it was a LOT of words.... and not much happening. Maybe this was because I was listening to the audiobook but it just felt like it dragged a bunch of times. Otherwise I did enjoy the audiobook and I loved the narrator's voice. I'm just not used to listening to fantasy so I probably went the wrong route with this one.

And boy, was this book really fantasy and magical. While I loved the world and the mystery around it, I loved the characters even more, especially Lazlo. Lazlo is the purest person of them all and I just want him to be safe and happy. There is a romance and it was honestly just pretty sweet. It was a little bit insta-love but they were so cute so I didn't care. I really wish better things had happened to them though.

Mostly I wish I hadn't waited so long to read this beast of a book but at least the sequel comes out this year!",1521417600,5,book super neat ive said laini taylor differ level rest u strang dreamer young librarian name lazlo desper want find mysteri lost citi call weep suddenli get lifetim chanc fulfil lifelong dream legendari man call godslay weep mysteri ever actual purpos allow go blueskin goddess suddenli appear dream book insan realli good way book long flowerli descript world creat realli thorough also lot charact felt like flesh well especi godslay closest everyth happen honestli damn cool couldnt believ read rather listen audiobook thought thing couldnt get better sad heartbreak emot play whole time im still tri figur everyth shouldnt surpris know daughter smoke bone seri wild one thing lower rate littl person felt like lot word much happen mayb listen audiobook felt like drag bunch time otherwis enjoy audiobook love narrat voic im use listen fantasi probabl went wrong rout one boy book realli
30906,4741,827,"I loved this so much! Dare I say more than The Cruel Prince?

I really didn't really know what to expect when I started reading this, and I kind of preferred it that way. I can see why they call Holly Black the queen of Faerie!

Her writing pulled me in from the very beginning. It had a very magical feel to it. You can tell that she did her research on Faerie Lore. There was so much here that I swear it made my heart so full of happiness.

There wasn't a single character in this book that I didn't like (well besides the Alderking) Our main character Hazel was great. I just wanted to lean in and give her a hug from time to time. Not just Hazel though. I loved Ben, Jack, and the prince.

So not only do we get an awesome story, but we also get some Diversity! I loved Bens romance of him with another man. It was portrayed just as like it should be, normal! It gave me so much joy to read about his life and everything he was going through.

Another thing that I loved of course, was the romance! Oh my goodness, the feels that I was going through. Ill put a little quote below just so you can get a peek,

  I love you like in the storybooks. I love you like in the ballads. I love you like a lightning bolt. Ive loved you since the third month you came and spoke with me. I loved that you made me want to laugh. I loved the way you were kind and the way you would pause when you spoke, as though you were waiting for me to answer you. I love you and I am mocking no one when I kiss you, no one at all.

Oh my goodness! I was so wrapped up in this book that I didn't even realize I damn near to the end and when I did I tried to get myself to put the book down and walk away. I really did. Of course it didn't happen.

If you cant tell that I loved it, then maybe Im doing something wrong. I recommend this a 100 times over!

30907,4741,823,"It took me a while to finish this book, I think its becuase I usually steer away from historical fiction. Why have I done that for so long?  I honestly think it took me a while because it was something that I wasn't used to reading. Ive been trying to get out of my comfort zone with books that I read and this was recommended to me. Well I finally did it!

I adored our main character Audrey Rose! She was witty, sarcastic, and brilliant!

She refused to conform to what society wanted her to be. She was engrossed and fascinated by forensic science and a woman back in that time had no place in that kind of setting. Audrey Rose said why cant I?

  Where in a medical dictionary does it say a woman cannot handle such things? What is a mans soul made of that a womans is not? I teased. I had no idea my innards were composed of cotton and kittens, while yours were filled with steel and steam-driven parts.

I loved reading about her journey trying to find out who was murdering all these women. Her interactions with Thomas were funny I loved every minute of it.

I read a lot of reviews that when the killer was revealed it was obvious. Well, I didn't see it coming at all! This book kept me on my toes and I actually enjoyed it.

There are more main characters to keep track of than in some of his other series, and not having the background of previous books can make it hard to remember who is who, for me at least.

This book introduces Annabelle Conroy to the Camel Club team, but first, Annabelle creates her own team to pull a long con on Jerry Bagger, with whom she has a beef dating back to her father Paddy. Annabelle's plan is for each member of her team to split up and get out of the country, lay low, and not flash the cash around. But she breaks this plan when she sees the notice of her former husband (DeHaven)'s death, even though she knows she's courting danger after Bagger realizes he's been had.

30916,4844,3901,"The Broken Girls by Simone St. James is a haunting story revolving around a ghost inhabiting an all-girls boarding school in 1950. This school is for the wayward ladies, girls that families did not want, that society was trying to hide. The ghost-Mary Hands was a young girl of sixteen, whom, just after giving birth to a stillborn baby throws herself into the thralls of panic, leaving her parents to banish her, dying on their front steps. Mary haunts the girls of the school in her black veil and dress, making her victims relive their greatest fears. Simone focuses primarily on four girls, best friends, until suddenly one of them goes missing. Nobody can find their friend, chalking it up to running away, yet the girls know better. The story runs parallel with that of journalist, Fiona in 2014. Fiona's sister died on school grounds twenty years ago, brutally murdered by her boyfriend at the time. Fiona has not come to terms with this loss, that there is something incomplete in the investigation of her sister.  Therefore, when the abandoned school begins its remodel, she is first on the story. Uncovering the past of the school and the women in it, Fiona realizes that this story involves much more than the supernatural.

I loved this book! I have written other works by Simone St. James and she writes a beautiful, haunting, ghost story.  I love the parallel story line too, how the ghost of Mary intertwines in both of their lives and the connections made throughout time. The ending was not as surprising as I hoped it would be, you basically have it figured out towards the end, that being said, it still gripped my attention and I finished this book in a day!

30917,3828,3901,"This is a bleak and unsettling story about a girls' boarding school in Vermont named Idlewild, which opened in 1919 and closed in 1979. Its students were misfits in the minds of the families who sent their children there. Out of sight, out of mind. Family Visit Days were the last Sunday of every month, not that many families took advantage of that.

The story is told in the dueling time periods of 1950 and 2014. Fiona Sheridan is a journalist, just like her famous (now retired) father Malcolm. It's also the 20th anniversary of when her sister Deb was found murdered on the grounds of Idlewild. Even though Deb's boyfriend Tim was tried and convicted of her murder, Fiona still feels unsure whether her sister's actual killer is sitting in prison. She embarks on her own investigation along with the help of her boyfriend Jamie. Jamie is a police officer who Fiona met in a bar about a year ago, and he just happens to be the son of the former Chief of Police...the same one who was on the scene when her sister's body was found.

Idlewild is haunted by a very dark female presence who preys upon your worst fears. The core unit of Idlewild friends in 1950 were Katie, the devastatingly beautiful and headstrong troublemaker; Roberta, the girl who lost her voice after a traumatic event; Cece, the illegitimate child of her housekeeper mother and rich employer; and French-born Sonia, who had been forced to work in a nazi prisoner camp. In a parallel universe with Deb Sheridan from 1994, one of these girls dies in 1950. The mystery to be solved over the course of the book is who actually killed both of these girls...and what is the true identity of the evil presence that casts a pall over Idlewild?

I loved the change in time periods and the camaraderie of the school girls. They found refuge and hope in each other in the face of their individual life challenges. It also was a chilling mystery that deliciously unravelled to a peaceful and satisfying end.

30918,950,3901,"Idlewild Hall has been abandoned since 1979. Until then, it was a boarding school of last resort, where parents sent the daughters they'd sooner rather forget. Now someone is looking to restore it, bringing back all of journalist Fiona Sheridan's memories of her teenage sister, Deb. Deb was murdered and her body left in the fields of Idlewild. A rich teen--her sister's boyfriend--named Tim Christopher was charged with Deb's murder. But it never seemed quite right to Fiona. So, she decides to write a story about the restoration, but encounters more than she bargained for as she begins to uncover years of long-buried secrets.

This is a wonderful, captivating book that drew me in immediately. I've never read anything by Simone St. James, so this was a welcome surprise. The novel alternates between two time periods: 1950 and 2014. In 1950, we hear from four girls attending Idlewild Hall--Katie, CeCe, Sonia, and Roberta. One of the girls soon goes missing and her disappearance ties to 2014, where Fiona is both searching for more information about her sister's death and, eventually, more knowledge about the missing Idlewild student. It's incredibly well-done and extremely suspenseful, drawing you quickly into the narrative and the two separate but related worlds.

The book plays on the boarding school mystique and offers up more supernatural elements than I was expecting, but they somehow work here. The novel is creepy and not one I always wanted to be reading alone in the dark! Like some of my favorites, Jennifer McMahon and Carol Goodman, St. James has a flair for the eerie and the ghostly, and it works well in this context. The boarding school stands stark and haunting in the book-terrifying at times-and you feel the fear ooze across the pages from the various characters.

Indeed, St. James does a great job capturing her characters, whom practically come to life before your very eyes. The group from boarding school are excellent--each different in their own way--and Fiona is an excellent, complicated character as well. While the two eras stood alone, I enjoyed how the stories intermingled and slowly tangled together, making the book quite fascinating and a real page-turner. This one wasn't what I expected; at times, it could be quite heartbreaking and touching.

Overall, this is an incredibly well-done thriller. It's quite captivating with lovely characters. A great discovery.

30919,2784,3901,"Is it only a little over a year ago since I discovered Simone St. James through the fantastic book Lost Among the Living? Apparently so since then have I read a couple of her older books, and I quite enjoy her haunting tales. The Broken Girls captivated me from the first page and I enjoyed this hauntingly tragic story. As a big fan of books with dual storylines was I intrigued by both stories.

Journalist Fiona Sheridan sister was murdered twenty years previously and her body was found lying in the overgrown fields near the ruins of Idlewild Hall. Although it seems that the case is closed with the boyfriend being tried and convicted for the murder can't Fiona shake the feeling that something about the case is wrong. While Fiona investigates Idlewild Hall that has now been sold do we learn what happened in the 50s, through flashback chapters, at the school when one of the girls went missing...

The Broken Girls is an engaging story with an underlying feeling of paranormal. It's the paranormal vibes that make this book a bit extra thrilling to read I think.

30921,49,3902,"Number 14 in the Ghostwalker series, clearly Ms. Feehan knows her craft well. It is not necessary to have read the previous books as explanations are given for who and what the characters are in this world of physically and psychically enhanced elite super soldiers, scientists, and spies. COVERT GAME is an action thriller series with paranormal elements.

Zara Hightower was raised in a compound by the creator of all these super enhanced people and still works for him though not willingly. Dr. Whitney seems to be a decidedly evil Dr. Frankenstein type of fellow who only cares for his own work and glory. Zaras skill is industrial espionage and developing artificial intelligence. She is a genius at what she does on both fronts being able to communicate telepathically with computers. Zaras assignment to infiltrate the data network of a Chinese crime lord turns into a mlange of torture and suffering before she is rescued by members of the Ghostwalker team who have left Whitneys control. One of the members, Gino Mazza, a doctor, but also antithetically an assassin, sets out to save Grace from the psychopathic businessman holding her hostage in Shanghai. Once rescued, she needs much physical and emotional healing while staying in the Fontenot compound deep in the swamps of Louisiana. Zara is too valuable of an asset to be left alone by the sadistic Zhu or Whitney, so several attempts are made to recover her with deadly consequences. Gino sees Zara as the woman who will rescue him as well from his own personal darkness. She is his to love and protect which he will do with his own life if necessary.

This story is a very intense ride with some very gritty elements of torture and abuse juxtaposed with a group of people, the renegade Ghostwalkers, who have overcome their own difficult situations becoming a family that cares for and protects one another. Clearly, Ms. Feehan really does her research well. In this case not only artificial intelligence, but the seamy underworld of human trafficking in countries where the monsters are not paranormals; but, humans who use and abuse others with seeming impunity.",1521504000,4,number 14 ghostwalk seri clearli m feehan know craft well necessari read previou book explan given charact world physic psychic enhanc elit super soldier scientist spi covert game action thriller seri paranorm element zara hightow rais compound creator super enhanc peopl still work though willingli dr whitney seem decidedli evil dr frankenstein type fellow care work glori zara skill industri espionag develop artifici intellig geniu front abl commun telepath comput zara assign infiltr data network chine crime lord turn mlang tortur suffer rescu member ghostwalk team left whitney control one member gino mazza doctor also antithet assassin set save grace psychopath businessman hold hostag shanghai rescu need much physic emot heal stay fontenot compound deep swamp louisiana zara valuabl asset left alon sadist zhu whitney sever attempt made recov deadli consequ gino see zara woman rescu well person dark love protect life necessari stori intens ride gritti element tortur abus juxtapos group peopl renegad
30922,2260,3831,"Theodosia Theo Browning, along with her sidekick and employee, Drayton Connelly is enjoying the Gaslights and Galleons Parade at Timothy Nevilles Charleston mansion. Suddenly a body shockingly falls over the railing to his death. The victim is Carson Lanier, a local banker and this is not looking like an accident at all. Timothy pleads with Theo to use her investigative skills to find out who could have done such a thing.

Theo and Drayton are immediately on the case. They dig through Carsons life and begin to uncover his involvement in some mysterious things. Theres a soon-to-be ex-wife who seems to have a lust for money, a secret business partner and a secret mistress. There is no end to the suspect list, but Theo is determined she will uncover the true culprit.

This is the 19th book in Laura Childs Tea Shop Mystery series. I haven't read the previous ones and I was hesitant to jump in this late in the game, but I loved every minute of it. Im a fan of Laura Childs Scrapbooking Mystery series and Ive been wanting to try her other cozy mystery series. So, when I had an opportunity to read this one, I grabbed it. My only complaint is that I didn't start this series sooner.

I had no problem getting to know the characters right from the start. I didn't feel as if I was coming into the middle of a movie. I felt a part of the story rght away. The mystery begins and ends with this book. There isn't a cliffhanger or any kind of mystery which needs to be read in order. At least I didn't feel as if there were any.

Theres a romance brewing for Theo with the local detective. Id be interested to see where that leads.

The storyline moved at a fast pace and kept me guessing almost to the end. Its very well-written. I can see me getting involved in this series from book #1.

30923,480,3589,"Two of the most pervasive killers and two of the most difficult to control are stress and inflammation. Chopra and Tanzi present a well researched approach to using your mind and body, or mindbody, to heal yourself from these afflictions.

Todays world is filled with situations that raise your stress level from traffic to despair over the world situation. In this book the authors discuss what stress is and how to move from being controlled by external stress to using your inner resources to take control of your life. Inflammation is another killer. From the American diet, heavy on sugar, fat and refined grains, to the polluted air we breathe most of us are hurting ourselves with high levels of uncontrolled inflammation.

The authors present a chapter on each of these major health concerns along with suggestions for how to get your stress and inflammation levels under control. In addition to the these two major topics, other aspects of health and wellness are discussed. The book also offers a seven day plan aimed at moving from debilitating habits and beliefs to better health.

I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in healing and maintaining awareness of the fact that our minds and bodies are integrally connected. The interaction is much more important than most of us realize and can lead to health or wellness. The choice is in how each person interacts with their environment both internal and external.

30933,44,3534,"This is the first book Ive read by Worthington, but if this book is any indication, it won't be my last!
Ive struggled with fear, worry, and anxiety for as long as I can remember. Logically, I know I can take it all to God in prayer and then let it go. However, the application is not always easy for me. And this is exactly what Worthington tackles in Fierce Faith.

Each chapter addresses a different fear, so there is likely something relatable for everyone:

Fear of Rejection
Fear for Our Children
Fear of Failure
Fear of Betrayal
Fear of Missing Out
Fear of the Future
Fear of Not Being Enough
Fear that We Are on Our Own

Worthington uses lists all over the place, which made list maker very happy! The lists are designed to help the reader create their own battle plan for when they're under attack and headed toward the Bad Bs: busy, blame, bury, binge, and brood.

While this book is geared toward women, there are lessons and wisdom in this book which are relevant to anyone. The tips are practical, and the author encourages the reader all through the book with personal stories and tips for when the enemy attacks. She strives to empower the reader to replace the enemys lies with Gods truths. I have highlights and notes all over the place, and I know Ill go back and reference them on more than one occasion.

Some of my favorite quotes (reminders) are:

Fear is a liar.
Our thoughts give life or steal joy.
Dont let the fear of tomorrow steal your life today.
If God, maker of all heaven and earth, has complete confidence in us, who are we to doubt ourselves?
Your worries won't change your what-ifs, but prayer will.
Gods presence doesnt mean you are fearless; it means you can fear less.
Failure is the rich soil in which our faith grows.

30936,666,3901,"The Broken Girls by Simone St. James is my first book by this author.  When I started this book, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Upon completing this book, I now have to research more about St. James, as I loved The Broken Girls.

This book revolves around two different time periods, and two POVs.  The first POV is set in 1950, where 4 young girls are sent by their family to Idlewild Hall, in Vermont.  The boarding school is a place where troubled girls are sent, and we meet Katie, Roberta, CeCe and Sonia, who become roommates.  The school is rumored to be haunted, where both students and teachers fear a ghost called Mary Hand.  We watch and learn about these girls, their lives, their fears, and how they ended up in the dismal spooky Idlewild.  Katie is the strong and beautiful one, CeCe is a follower and Roberta is smart.  Sonia is from Europe, and has no family.

In 2014, Fiona Sheridan is a journalist, who has grieved for 20 years the death of her sister, who was murdered on the grounds of Idlewild, which is now decaying and closed.  Her sisters murderer is in jail, but Fiona cannot get past the questions of why her sisters boyfriend, who still claims his innocence, would murder her.  When Idlewild is purchased with the plan of renovating the school, Fionas journalistic mind plans to research and find evidence to help her solve the old murder.  Along the way, a body is found in the well, and the death took place in 1950, which has Fiona also researching that death.  Is there any connection to the two deaths 64 years apart?

This was a terrific suspenseful, dark and at times scary story that had me on the edge of my seat.  Once you get to the half way point, there is no putting this book down. There are so many secrets between both sides, as we go between both povs, with the death of the girl in 1950 bringing some things together.  The twists and turns, with an amazing surprising finish were so well done by St. James.  Fiona will find her life in danger, as she continues her investigation into both eras.

To tell too much more would be spoilers, and you really need to read this book from start to finish.  St. James not only has created a fantastic amazing Gothic thriller, but she also gives us some wonderful characters that we will not forget;  Fiona, the 4 girls in 1950, Fionas boyfriend, the Edens, the Ghost and the villain.

The Broken Girls is an awesome and exciting mystery, that had a slight paranormal element that was done very well, giving this a chilling gothic feel at times.  The mystery has so many surprises, and I fully loved how this ended.  Simone St. James did an amazing job writing this captivating thriller.

30942,4557,143,"Small Great Things by Jodi Picoult was a great read, albeit a massively difficult read.

This book was my literary introduction to Jodi Picoult.  I was not disappointed.

Small Great Things is the intertwined story of 3 main people. Ruth, Turk and Kennedy. There are 2 things you need to know; First, Ruth is black. Second Turk is a White Supremacist. Ruth is a labor and Delivery nurse who is assigned to the after care of Turks newborn son Davis.  Turk demands that Ruth be removed from his childs care and not be allowed access to the baby.  The lead nurse, Ruths boss, allows the request. Rightfully upset by the new order, Ruth is removed from the care of Davis and re-assigned to another family.  Following a routine circumcision, Davis is left under Ruths supervision due to an emergency in the L/D ward, when the childs condition deteriorates. Ruth is left with a choice. Obey the familys and her bosses orders and leave the child alone or follow her nurses oath and do what she can to aide the failing child.

Despite all efforts to help the ailing child, he does not survive. Entombed with grief, Turk blames Ruth for the death of his son and sets out to sue her personally for Murder.

You are taken through the trial prep, the trial and left with an outcome that you both expected and didn't.  You are left with learning who changes and what changes them. While there is a large racial undertone to the entire story live, it is addressed both tastefully and head-on.

The book is fantastically written and while difficult to read, i did not want it to end.

It is not very often I add a vivid personal note to my reviews. However, I feel that in this case it is deserved.  Given the current climate of racial tensions, this book was a head read, as well as a slap in the face.  It takes you through what is felt on both sides. The constant fight of a minority to survive and be seen as who they are and what they can do rather than their skin color. As well as the things people say and do when faced with racism, fighting to convince everyone you don't see color, or that telling someone else "" my best friend is * insert any race here * .. It makes you look hard at yourself, your thoughts and those around you. I've learned a few things about myself from reading this, both good and bad. I'm grateful for those lesson, as I don't know if I would have had to face them in another circumstance.

Reading this book made me uncomfortable, but i think that was partially the point.

30944,3011,3790,"After meeting over a surgical table in Devil in Spring, we finally have Dr. Garrett Gibson and Ethan Ransom's story!

Dr. Gibson is waylaid by rape-y drunk soldiers on the way home from helping deliver a baby. She has her trusty cane and her fencing skills, but three against one is still a tall order. Swooping in to ""rescue her,"" depending on who's perspective you take, is the man who has secretly been making sure she makes it home every night.

Both annoyed at the enforced chivalry but wildly intrigued and attracted to Ethan Ransom, Garrett agrees to Ethan's request to give her proper self-defense training. He also gifts her a silver police whistle, just in case.

Ethan has been in love with Garrett since she saved Lady Pandora's life, but his dangerous occupation means he needs to stay away from her. He just can't and unfortunately his weakness is exploited by the man who hold's his very life in his hands.

A gunshot wound, a secret plot to blame Irish Nationalists for violence, and family ties make this an exciting and highly sexy continuation of the Ravenal Series.

I adore Kleypas's historical details, especially regarding Garrett's medical skills. It often reminded me of the Outlander series, just 100 years later in time. It was fun to see an Irish brogue-ed hero, and a Dr. Quinn-medicine woman type character find true love. All of the conflict made sense and I liked that lies did not create the drama.

I'm also super excited to read West's book! There is quite a lot of West, and he become quite endearing to me.

I did notice the problematic passage detailing how Ethan gained his sexual prowess, basically exploring the Kama Sutra with an Indian woman. Definitely did not need this for the story and frankly I'm tired of it.

Author: Rebecca Ross

Age Group: Teen/Young Adult

Genre: Fantasy

Series: Untitled Trilogy, book one

Star Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars

I borrowed this book from my local library and reviewed it.

I found this book the way I usually find my library books; a recommendation from the newest books of January. I was intrigued by the plot, as well as the gorgeous, colorful cover. So as soon as I had an opening in my library stack, I ordered it, waiting impatiently. It got pushed to the top of my stack after another library overhaul, and I dove in, excited for this debut, rife with magic, mythology, political intrigue, forbidden love, and thrilling adventureThe Queens Rising is one of my favorite books of 2018, and I cant wait for the sequel! It had almost everything I love in a debut novel, and I was so excited to find out that this book was the first in a projected trilogy! Newcomer Rebecca Ross has absolutely outdone herself with this new spin on a high fantasy novel!

Brienna is a fatherless child, sent to the passion academy in Magnalia to train in one of the noble arts: music, art, dramatics, wit, or knowledge. Seven years on, she has found her passion, after dabbling in each: knowledge. The goal of a passion is to attain a patron who can take them under their wing. Brienna is terrified that she will not find someone to properly nurture her talents, and when the solstice comes, her worst fear comes true. To add to her stress, she is plagued by mysterious visions, hailing back to a time before the country was even formed. When a disgraced, enigmatic man offers her patronage, she accepts, though suspicion is at the forefront of her mind. She is soon drawn into a dangerous, seductive web of political intrigue, personal secrets, magic, and war, and she must decide which side shes on: passion or blood. The choice could turn the tide of her life and the war.

I really, really enjoyed this book! What a beautifully written, thrilling debut! I was absolutely entranced; the worldbuilding was excellent, the beautiful writing, the breakneck pacing, and the characters were memorable. Rebecca Ross has become one of my new favorite authors with this lovely book, and I cant wait for the sequels! It wasn't perfect; there were times when I was confused about the timelines lining up, and despite there being a dramatis personae, all of the characters and their aliases got confusing. But nonetheless, this debut was really solid! Brienna was my favorite character of the book, doubtful and unsure at first, growing into a powerful, driven and ambitious woman who isn't afraid to stand for what she believes in and who she loves. I loved the world that she inhabited, where the arts were as highly valued as being a warrior, whether one was male or female. The pacing was insane; divided into different parts, going old school, even with a good old table of contents, I was absolutely spellbound, and there were times when I couldn't stop thinking about it, even when I was in the middle of something else. The ending was heartbreaking, explosive, and satisfying; this book was very enjoyable! It had everything youd expect in a great high fantasy and more, with feminist, powerful characters to boot! Highly recommended! The bottom line: A gorgeously written, beautifully wrought fantasy chock full of my favorite things, I loved The Queens Rising, and I cant wait for more from this promising new author!

He has been chosen to represent Italy primarily for his swimming ability. He has a positive attitude about going to Europa because it will help humanity and there is nothing left on Earth for him.

Naomi is a science nerd. While her family has had to move to higher ground a couple to times, she still lives with her parents and her beloved younger brother who has a defective heart. The last thing she wants to do is go permanently to Europa and leave her family. She doesn't have a choice, though, because being chosen is equivalent to being drafted. All the kids are also told that if they deliberately try to be sent home, they will be prosecuted and imprisoned.

This story follows the training the kids go through including injections that are supposed to help them survive on Europa. Noami's roommate has a bad reaction to the injections and washes out of the program. Another of the candidates goes crazy which Naomi believes is because of the injections but the kids are told that he had a previously undiagnosed psychological issue. Naomi becomes more and more sure that the kids aren't being given the whole story and begins to do some research using hacking software her brother slipped to her as a going away present.

She and Leo begin a friendship which leads to a romance even though he is still convinced that the mission is a good one even while Naomi becomes more and more sure that it is not. There are also interpersonal problems for the kids to deal with two. Leo's rival for the dive expert on the mission is Beckett Wolfe who happens to be the nephew of the President of the United States. He is willing to do anything to sabotage Leo's chances including an attempted murder.

The story was exciting, action-packed and had a nice romance. It also begins a series. I have read a few similar books recently. THE COUNTDOWN CONSPIRACY by Katie Slivensky, NYXIA by Scott Reintgen, and UNEARTHED by Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner all have a similar themes for science fiction fans who want more while waiting for book 2.",1521504000,4,human trash earth climat chang rais ocean drown mani citi human last best hope choos team six teenag go mission jupit moon europa terraform new home human book tell stori twentyfour kid compet six spot book told two point view leo orphan rome lost parent belov younger sister tsunami wave hit rome stori begin get readi die sinc hope chosen repres itali primarili swim abil posit attitud go europa help human noth left earth naomi scienc nerd famili move higher ground coupl time still live parent belov younger brother defect heart last thing want go perman europa leav famili doesnt choic though chosen equival draft kid also told deliber tri sent home prosecut imprison stori follow train kid go includ inject suppos help surviv europa noami roommat bad reaction inject wash program anoth candid goe crazi naomi believ inject kid told previous undiagnos psycholog issu naomi becom sure
30951,503,3826,"Calvin Fisher has left the Amish faith after a terrible childhood.  His older brother, Mark, was the one who raised him.  At the age of 14 Calvin left Horse Cave, Kentucky and began a descent into a life of alcohol and drugs.  Now, he has cleaned up his act.  He works for the DEA as an informant in exchange for them paying debts he owed to a gang.  Calvin is still a member of the gang, but he secretly reports information to the DEA.  The only way out of the gang is death, so Calvin knows he has a dim future and short life ahead of him.  He has kept his distance from his brother in the past, but recently they had somewhat of a reconciliation.  He doesnt want Mark or Marks wife to become a potential target for the gang, so he stays away.
Calvin receives a telephone call from his sister-in-law telling him Mark is very sick with kidney cancer and she needs Calvins help with Mark.  Calvin returns home and becomes interested in the neighbor across the street, Alice Yoder.  Alice is a preschool teacher who is house-sitting for her brother while he is on vacation.  She finds Calvin attractive and accepts him at face value.  She doesnt know he is involved in a gang or what he must do as a member of the gang.  Soon, criminal activity is on the up rise in Horse Cave.  Has Calvins gang decided to move in or are they just checking up on him to make sure he is doing what he said he would do?  Is the gang doubting his loyalty?  Alice even has some scary encounters and her school is vandalized.  Is Calvins gang responsible?
This is a story that will get readers involved from page one.  Shelleys writing is such that it draws readers in with easy prose and likeable characters.  Calvins protectiveness of Alice was admirable.  He was so gentle with her, but so tough with his gang.  He had a difficult time when people still thought the worst of him because of his past, but he couldn't tell them he had changed as he was undercover.  Alice believed in him as a person not based on his job.

30953,1173,482,"So I read this as it was someone elses pick for the Horror Postal Book Club Im in, and my first reaction when I received it was oh my goodness, this book is huge. It happened to be the first Joe Hill novel Ive got around to reading, and it really was a wild ride. A long one.
It feels dystopian, apocalyptic, and sometimes sci-fi, and has huge sections that have a lot of action, but then it also felt quite slow in parts. I definitely feel like it could have been a lot less than 762 pages to get the story told.
Since Ive journaled my way through my reading of this for my book club (we are mailing the book to each other; all the way from Singapore to me in Seattle, and back to out to Asia by way of BC, Germany, and Spain), I won't babble too much here, especially since there are tons of reviews. My next Joe Hill will have to be NOS4A2, so Id love to see how his writing compares between novels. This is entirely entertaining (and depressing, in too many ways!), but not the quickest read.

30955,2766,3903,"This was my most anticipated book of the year, so I bought the audio version at the earliest possible moment and listened to it eagerly. It completely delivers on its promise, exposing potential new political self-dealing scandals.

Previously, Schweizer's ""Clinton Cash"" book contributed to Hillary Clinton's election loss. This new book could be the death knell for Joe Biden's presidential hopes, as it reveals how his son, Hunter Biden, benefited from the former Vice President's dealings with foreign countries. Schweizer is evenhanded, though, targeting politicians from both parties. Mitch McConnell could easily become the target of an ethics investigation based on this book's suggestion that McConnell has taken official acts that benefit his Chinese in-laws financially.

The book reveals a kind of self-dealing that I had not considered before by suggesting that Obama (1) used regulations in the education and energy sectors to depress the prices of certain stocks (e.g., the University of Phoenix and fossil fuel companies), at which time friends of Barack, including George Soros, bought the stocks and then (2) eased pressure, allowing the stocks to rebound and enriching anyone who invested at the stocks' low points.

For any reader who worries about the mainstream media's failure to investigate the financial dealings of Obama and other politicians, this book is a partial remedy.

30956,1542,2408,"I don't know how I missed that this book was part of a loosely bound series  although perhaps series is too formal a word. It continues along the lives of characters from other books, fills out other characters story lines and introduces others. The book starts with the love story of Edith and Joseph; two people very much in love who build a place of refuge and peace within the walls of their house on the water.

The book then moves to the present as Clare is about to get married  but she is experiencing more than cold feet. She has far too many reservations about her fiance but doesnt feel she can just stop things at this juncture. As she worries and frets she is consoled by her childhood friend and oddly enough by a stranger; a woman who happens to be at the resort where the wedding is to be held. This woman gives Clare the strength to make her decision.

As Clare goes on with her life she soon receives word that the woman she met for that one weekend has died and left her a house. Clare goes to the house, Blue Sky House  Edith and Josephs house  to find refuge and what she finds is Edith and her story.

This is the kind of book that stays with you long after you read it. The characters are so real you feel like you know them and you want to spend time with them. Neither Clares nor Ediths story really dominates as each feeds the other.  As Clare learns about the history of her unexpected gift she also starts to learn about the mystery woman who so altered her life.  Its a story that is full of love and loss, passion and sorrow. but most of all happiness and fulfillment. There is much to learn from a live well lived with a person you love.

I thoroughly enjoyed Ill Be Your Blue Sky even when it wasn't always easy to read. It covers some of the worst of relationships but yet love does triumph. One has to always hold on to that.

30960,2752,3904,"Advanced Reader Copy (ARC) provided by the Author and Publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an fair and honest review.

This is the best book of the series, too bad, it's the last one. This is an excellent example of what I class as Romantic-Suspense Lite. Romance, suspense/mystery on the light side with a touch of humor. This book does it all and extremely well. I can't wait to read what Lori Foster does next.

Throughout the series there has been an overarching mystery: What actually happened to Scott Silver, the founder of Body Armor. Sahara has been determined to make Body Armor the very best name in personal protection and the legacy her brother left her is now one of the top. She has always maintained that Scott is alive and she wants Body Armor to be better than when her brother left it and she has succeeded. Now, if only her brother would return. Everyone thinks he's dead, everyone but Sahara.

Brand Berry was blown away by the sassy, take charge, beautiful, compassionate Sahara Silver. Sahara is after Brand to leave the MMA fight world and join Body Armor, and has been for months. Sahara knows that he will make an excellent addition to her staff and if not her staff, then possibly her bedroom. For Sahara, the her brother's agency always comes first, but Brand needs more. He has been putting off both the invitation to join Body Armor and the invitation to Sahara's bed. When shes kidnapped by men searching for her missing brother, he doesnt hesitate to join the Body Armor Boys and kick some kidnapper a--. After the rescue he makes it his priority to cover Sahara, every single delectable inch of her.

The kidnapper wants more from Sahara than just the money he feels Scott owes him.

30961,2717,3904,"Fast Burn was a great way to end the series.  Finally we get Sahara and Brand's story.  Ms. Foster always saves the best for last.  Sahara has been trying to hire Brand for her agency, but he has been resisting.  She also wants him in her bed.  Brand has been fighting his feelings for a long time.  When Sahara is kidnapped, Brand decides it's up to him to protect her at all cost.

Sahara has been a great character to follow.  She is a commanding woman who everyone likes and respects.  She has a hard exterior, but can also show a softer side.  What I loved about Brand was the way he didn't try to change her strong mind and authority. Well, except when he wanted to protect her.  Sahara was also able to let her guard down around Brand.  They were a great match and it was fun to watch them banter and feed off each other. There were a lot of funny moments. Not to mention some very steamy bedroom scenes.

As usual, I won't give away any plot, it would ruin so much. We do get to find out what happened to Scott, Sahara's brother.  It was a good mystery with some finger nail biting scenes.  It's out today.  Go read it!  You won't be sorry.  While I am sad to see this series end and to say goodbye to a long list of characters that I have loved for years, I do look forward to seeing what Ms. Foster comes up with next.

30962,667,3904,"Just when I am in need of a good book fix, Lori Foster releases Fast Burn, the conclusion to her Body Armor series. I can count on her to grab me from page one and this one is no exception. Foster keeps a steady pace, mixing action, romance, and familiar faces with an ease that keeps me turning the pages.
Foster creates unique characters, Sahara Silver being a prime example. She exudes confidence and vulnerability, balancing the roles of boss, lover, and little sister. She is a fully developed complex character. I couldn't help but like the fashion diva who doubles as a bad a@#.
Brand holds his own, because honestly. I am a capable and independent woman. I also like a man who is not afraid to be a man. And an alpha male who respects women - better yet likes women, who is capable feeling and dealing with deep emotions? Yes, please.

30965,564,3901,"The prologue of The Broken Girls grabbed my interest right away because I was wondering what the heck was going on and then the idea of a wraith like person being behind it, oh heck yeah. This story transitions between a narrative from the year 1950 to the year 2014 all taking place in a small town in Vermont. In the beginning it took me a bit to get into the story because of the back and forth with multiple points of view but once the groundwork was laid the story just flowed. There was a paranormal presence in this story that was a little terrifying and had me asking myself if nighttime was the best time to continue this story, but I persevered. 

I cannot say enough about the setting for this story and the details in both the past and the present which made it come alive. I could clearly see the setting as the Author intended and it filled me with dread to consider what it must have been like for the occupants of Idlewild Hall. What a miserable place the girls had to live in! There was also the tension and conflict that surrounded the murder of the main characters sister that kept the story moving right along. Trying to see if there was a connection between the past and present while searching out what really happened to Fionas sister added to the overall could not put it down feeling that I had!

This was a superb suspense filled thriller that revealed all its secrets bit by bit. There was a romance element to this story but it only added a delicious conflict to the story and did not detract from it at all. As the story developed I was drawn in further and further and really found myself liking all the characters. At the start of the story I was not all that into the 1950s characters but the end I wanted the story to continue because they were wonderful! This was the first novel that I read from Author Simone St. James and it will not be the last! The Broken Girls is a page-turner that is chilling, mysterious, and captivating. I highly recommend you get your hands on a copy as soon as it hits the shelves!

30968,4007,3901,"The Broken Girls by Simone St. James is a mystery/thriller read that has supernatural elements to it. Told in alternating timelines from several points of view the books was still easy to follow and one that will captivate the reader on the mystery side but give chills with the ghostly elements.

In 2014, Fiona Sheridan is a journalist who was once touched by tragedy when the body of her sister was found. Her sisters boyfriend at the time was tried and convicted of the murder but Fiona has never thought the details sounded right and has always questioned just what happened that horrific night.

When Fiona finds out that the nearby Idlewild Hall is going to be restored she decides to run a piece on the property that was once a boarding school for troubled teen girls. There have always been rumors and ghost stories flying around about the property and now with the current renovations a discovery has been made that sends Fionas investigation back to the past.

In 1950 at Idlewild Hall four of the troubled girls that reside at the school bond together and become friends. Katie, Sonia, Cece, and Roberta have heard about the mysterious lady in black that is supposed to haunt the grounds of Idlewild Hall but then one of the girls goes missing and the adults are writing her off as a runaway.

The writing within The Broken Girls was wonderful and it didn't take long to become fully engrossed in the story. The changing timelines and alternating points of view were easily followed as the layers of the story unfolded. Whether one believes in ghosts or things that go bump in the night or not this is sure to be one that will still entertain readers from beginning to end. When finished Id definitely recommend checking out the haunting mystery.

30970,1658,3901,"Idlewild Hall is hardly a sanctuary. It's more aptly described as . . . a prison.

In the 1950's, the school is where the forgotten girls are sent. The troublemakers. The unwanted ones. The promiscuous and daring. The ones with intelligence that threatens the egos of the more masculine sex. It's where girls who can think for themselves are banished. With bars concealed as dusty bricks and makeshift guards dressed up properly and called teachers, Idlewild is a penitentiary full of outdated rules and harsh regulations intent upon crushing the spirit. A place where the madness is not cured but nurtured, and where malcontent is not smothered but instead - fanned like a flame.

But there is some solace in friendship. There are four girls who share whispers in the dark and speak of their dreams by the moonlight that filters through their dirty, frosty window. The diverse walks of their previous life notwithstanding, they have found a way to bond and create a tiny sliver of happiness in an otherwise meager existence.

Katie, a wildly beautiful and reckless young lady with a smart mouth and clever ambition. Roberta, the athlete with fierce loyalty and a harbored and shameful secret. CeCe, the unwanted bastard child of a rich man is a girl who looks for every opportunity to be optimistic. And Sonia, the quiet and frail girl with a curious accent that speak of the horrors in her past that outweigh any transgression she could face at Idlewild.

They are all looked after by each other and, in the shadows, by another girl of Idlewild . . . or rather, a ghost. The haunting image of Mary Hand, a young woman whose spirit lingers at the school and shares frightening images as way of communication. She is always trying to get in while the other girls, well - they are always trying to get out.

As the present turns into history and the broken girls are forgotten, Idlewild Hall deteriorates into a pile of crumbled bricks and rubble. The gardens and grounds are nothing but haphazard weeds, their sole intent to cover and mask any sort of memory the school left behind. Wild animals in the shape of modern-day teenagers desecrate the remaining structure with midnight trysts and forbidden drinking parties. The place is as broken as the girls it once housed, but the mysteries of the secrets it holds hangs on for a select few.

One person who can never escape the clutches of Idlewild Hall is freelance journalist Fiona Sheridan, a local in the small Vermont town that sits on the edge of the the old school's overgrown grounds. She finds herself back there more often than she'd like to admit to herself, her grief-stricken father, or to her conscientious police officer boyfriend. Fiona's sister is what keeps her coming back; the girl she grew up idolizing was stripped of her youth when she was strangled and dumped on the grounds of Idlewild Hall. Abandoned in the night, discarded like trash in a dump, and left vulnerable to the elements of nature and of the gaping faces of the townsfolk who came to watch the aftermath, the death of the Sheridan girl was a scandal. Fiona has allowed the murder and its subsequent fall-out to remain a constant undercurrent of obsession in her life, no matter that her sister's boyfriend was arrested and sent to jail for the crime. Something about the case always seemed to not add up, and it has been a thorn in her side ever since.

When a construction crew shows up at Idlewild and begins demolition, Fiona's journalistic juices begin a slow and steady pump. The place has been abandoned for years, left to its own unsavory devices. Who would want to resurrect the place now? And for what purposes? As Fiona begins to delve further into the strange circumstances surrounding the redevelopment of such a sad and lonely structure, she uncovers more than she bargained for. There are certain secrets hidden in the depths of the school and its records that have been meticulously buried deep - almost as deep as the body found during the excavation of the school. Who is the dead girl, and what is her connection to Idlewild? Fiona will make it her purpose to find the answers, even if it means burning her entire life down around her in the process.

The Broken Girls is the newest novel by Simone St. James, the award-winning author of paranormal novelsThe Haunting of Maddy Clare and Silence for the Dead. With a knack for bringing history to life and twisting it together with creepy nuances and spine-tingling sketches, St. James is known for her impactful drawings of strong female characters and the descriptive ways in which she weaves their quests and plots.

My impression of The Broken Girls was ultimately one of regret. I was drawn to the initial storyline; there is something about boarding schools that always seem to attract me. They are usually saturated with disgusting wealth, intrigue, strong relationships, and mystique. This particular novel had a few of those bullet points locked down along with the appealing threads of modern-day mystery sewn in. However, there was something that felt continually disjointed about the novel and almost . . . unfinished. I wish the author had pushed the stories of the young ladies a bit more or left some characters out to create room for the established ones, and the misshapen way it all came together had me questioning what one subplot had to do with the other. It felt juvenile at times and underdeveloped, which was a shame because I enjoyed the style of writing overall.

Although I'm giving this novel 3.5 out of 4 stars, I still recommend it. I think it's an easy read and enjoyable in the throwaway sense. I'm sure plenty of readers will enjoy the fast-moving plot and lightly shrouded mystery. It's a good read for the beach or a road trip, but not ideal for those looking to become attached.",1521504000,3,idlewild hall hardli sanctuari aptli describ prison 1950 school forgotten girl sent troublemak unwant one promiscu dare one intellig threaten ego masculin sex girl think banish bar conceal dusti brick makeshift guard dress properli call teacher idlewild penitentiari full outdat rule harsh regul intent upon crush spirit place mad cure nurtur malcont smother instead fan like flame solac friendship four girl share whisper dark speak dream moonlight filter dirti frosti window diver walk previou life notwithstand found way bond creat tini sliver happi otherwis meager exist kati wildli beauti reckless young ladi smart mouth clever ambit roberta athlet fierc loyalti harbor shame secret cece unwant bastard child rich man girl look everi opportun optimist sonia quiet frail girl curiou accent speak horror past outweigh transgress could face idlewild look shadow anoth girl idlewild rather ghost haunt imag mari hand young woman whose spirit linger school share frighten imag way commun alway tri get girl well
30971,96,3830,"Let Me Lie is a standalone British suspense/thriller.

The main narrator is 26 year old Anna (1st person POV). The second narrator is Murray (3rd person POV). There are also some other chapters narrated by other people.

This book is divided into three parts. Each part ends with an explosive conclusion. I loved that the book was set up this way. There were some amazing reveals in this book that I did not see coming at all.

Anna is a new mom (her baby daughter is Ella). She lives with the baby's father Mark. In the last year or so both of her parents died. But how did they die? That is the mystery in this book. Something happens that sets off a chain of events. And the reader is left wondering what is happening.

Murray is a retired detective who volunteers at the police station. He becomes involved in figuring out what happened to Anna's parents.

I really liked Anna's chapters. And I found the mystery to be interesting. I was also very intrigued by Murray and his wife Sarah. But my favorite part of the book was definitely how the book was divided into parts. This was done in such an amazing way. And I loved that each Part ended with an amazing revelation. I love when a suspense book can surprise me. There was one shocker that I predicted. But I was very surprised a bunch of other times. I am rarely completely stunned (as I read a lot of suspense/thrillers). But the author did a very good job in this book.

I'm not exactly sure what to think of the ending. I had to read it a few times to really understand what the author was trying to say. The mystery is solved. Something else happened that I was not expecting. But then the last lines of the book gave me questions. I've definitely noticed this trend with some suspense/thrillers where questions are asked or things are left open-ended. I'm not sure if I love this, but it's interesting.

Overall, this book had lots of twists and turns. I enjoyed it.

30972,2147,3901,"Seamlessly weaving between 2014 and 1950, The Broken Girls by Simone St. James is a beguiling mystery with a ghostly element.

In 1950, Idlewild Hall is a boarding school for troubled girls. Roommates Katie Winthrop, CeCe Frank, Sonia Gallipeau and Roberta Greene are close friends who are quite protective of one another.  They have each experienced the supernatural phenomena of  resident ghost Mary Hand but they, like others before them, do not tell anyone what they see during these encounters.

In 2014, thirty seven year old journalist Fiona Sheridan is still grieving the loss of her sister Deb who was murdered twenty years earlier.  Debs boyfriend Tim Christopher was convicted of her murder and he is still in prison although he has always maintained his innocence. When Fiona learns the long abandoned Idlewild Hall property is about to brought back to life, her curiosity is piqued. Why on earth would current owner Margaret Eden want to reopen the school? Well, Fiona is going to put her journalist skills to work and write a story in which she hopes to answer this very question. She is on the property when remains are discovered in a well on the grounds and Fiona is more determined than ever to uncover the truth about the victims identity and hopefully unmask her killer.

The murder of her sister tore apart their family and Fiona has never quite recovered from her loss.  She still lives in her hometown and she writes freelance fluff articles  for a local magazine. Fionas decision to write an in depth article on Idlewild Hall is met with resistance from her cop boyfriend, Jamie Creel. He is worried about the effects of spending so much time on the property will have on her since Debs body was dumped there after her murder. Fiona ignores his objections and she, with the help of her journalist father, quickly manage to uncover the identity of the young woman found in the well.  She hits a dead end almost immediately since the girl immigrated to the United States not long after World War II.  Fiona is tenacious as she continues asking questions about her sisters death and tries to find out more information about the victim found in the well.

The chapters featuring Kate, CeCe, Sonia and Roberta are quite poignant since life at Idlewild Hall is not easy. The teachers are harsh and lacking in empathy for their students plight.  Many of the girls are sent to the school for circumstances that are well beyond their control and they endure horrible conditions at Idlewild Hall. Adding to their woes are the ghostly encounters with Mary whose tragic past is the subject of numerous rumors and much speculation.

The Broken Girls is a wonderful atmospheric mystery that is quite spooky and full of suspense.  The events in the past are just as fascinating as the ones in the present and the two story arcs converge in an absolutely unexpected  manner.  With plenty of twists and turns, Simone St. James brings Fionas search for the truth about her sisters death to an action-packed conclusion. A brilliant mystery that fans of the genres will love.

30973,2005,3901,"Idlewild Hall is a very gloomy place, haunted by the ghosts of young Mary Hand and her baby.  Its a school for girls, those girls who no one wants, those broken girls.  Its 1950 and one of the girls from a close knit group has gone missing.  Not much effort is made by the police to find her.  But her friends are sure they know what happened to her.

Jump to 2014, when journalist Fiona Sheridan is still battling the demons set loose by her sisters death twenty years ago.  The man who did it is in prison but Fiona cant help but believe there were things about her sisters death that have never come to light and she compulsively continues to look into it.  When she learns that Idlewild Hall is going to be renovated, she knows she must find out why.

This is a compelling, complex ghost story.  The ghost of Mary Hand is quite malicious and often sent chills up my spine.  But this book is much more than a mere ghost story, spellbinding as it is.  Its also a complex crime story of two separate crimes, a heart wrenching romance between two very likeable characters and a coming of age story of young girls who have known much hardship in their young lives.  This is a well-written novel and the tragedies of each of these girls is handled sensitively.  I was completely memorized by this book and thought the author pulled it all together at the end just beautifully.  It was such a sad story and one that I will long remember.

Recommended.

30974,1796,3902,"The GhostWalkers are back in another exhilarating book, one where I was completely thrilled to read. There was lots of action and adventure that got my blood pumping and intriguing suspense that had me biting my nails and the chemistry is off the charts electrifying.

Gino and Zara are strong, exciting characters that stir emotions and captivate readers with their story. The romance is sweet but oh so hot with Ginos alpha protective personality and Zaras tough but sweet vulnerable personality, so they are a bit opposite but it works fantastic for them as it sure generates some raging hot heat and keeps readers enthralled with the relationship as it grows.

Hair raising suspense builds from the very beginning as Zara finds herself in hot water and keeps right on building throughout the story which keeps readers on the edge with lots of thrills.  Whitney is back of course with his usual tricks and total disregard for human life but the GhostWalkers have a new set of enemies that were introduced in Power Game and let me tell you I would to blow this bad guy to smithereens. There is lots of danger with explosive action throughout the book and also a disturbing torture scene involving Zara that adds to the emotional impact of this fast paced plot.

Christine Feehan is one my favorite authors and the GhostWalkers world is of my top favorites. It is paranormal but it is also a tough action series that really gets the adrenaline pumping and makes hearts pound with some uber hot and sexy heroes and heroines.

30976,2147,3905,"The Wild Inside by Jamey Bradbury is an unusual paranormal novel about a young woman who lives in Alaskan wilderness.

Seventeen year old Tracy Petrikoff loves the outdoors. She is an avid hunter with an unusual proclivity for the animals she kills. Her family is heavily involved with dog sledding but following her mothers death,  they struggle financially after her father gives up mushing and sells the majority of their sled dogs. Tracy keeps hoping to change his mind about her competing in upcoming mushing events, but after she is suspended from school for fighting, her dad grounds her from taking care of the remainder of their dogs and roaming the woods surrounding their home. Headstrong and stubborn, Tracy defies him to check her traps but on one of her outings, she is suddenly attacked by a stranger in the forest. When the man, Tom Hatch, shows up at her home not long after their encounter bleeding from a knife wound, Tracy is afraid she is responsible but her memories of their first meeting are somewhat vague.  After her father hires drifter Jesse Goodwin to work in exchange for board, Tracy befriends him and she soon discovers Jesse is hiding many secrets.

Tracy is the novels sole narrator and she is not exactly a likable or sympathetic protagonist. She is rather selfish, very impulsive and extremely defiant. She greatly misses her mother who completely understood her daughters need to hunt and freely roam the surrounding woods. Tracy inherited her moms abnormal need for hunting and ability to psychically connect to animals and people in the aftermath of quenching her bizarre appetite.

The book summary is a little misleading since there is no mention of a paranormal element to the storyline. While this aspect is not overpowering, it does factor heavily into the plot.  The hunting scenes are graphic but it is what Tracy does after the animals are dead that might make readers squirm.

While the novel is well-written, Tracy does speak have a bit of a backwoods dialect. A lack of quotations marks during conversations is rather irritating. The storys setting is quite rustic and isolated but Jamey Bradburys descriptive prose makes it very easy to visualize the surrounding forest.

The Wild Inside is a slow-paced adventure that has unexpected supernatural/paranormal elements.  The suspense aspect of the plot is quite interesting  and Jesse is an intriguing addition to the cast of characters. However, Tracy makes such horrible decisions that she is unlikable and ultimately, irredeemable. A unique but very strange debut that is well researched and features a beautiful setting that is mish-mash of suspense, horror and paranormal genres.

30977,525,3905,"Alaska seems to be the hot setting for novels these days and Bradbury makes very effective use of her setting.  This is a hard book to review because I'm still not sure what the real story is with Tracy- is this a horror story?  Is it paranormal?  I don't know but I do know that I enjoyed it.  Tracy and her family are subsistence mushers who have been knocked for a loop by her mother's death along the side of a road.  This is the not pretty side of Alaska even before you know how Tracy treats animals she traps.  She very much loves her dogs, however, and lives to work with them (as well as to hunt.). This is not your standard 17 year old.  The arrival of Jesse changes things up for the family (which includes her brother Scott).  I don't want to give spoilers because this is the sort of novel where things build.  Little clues.  Little hints.

30978,1048,1939,"4.5 stars.  I simply adore this series.  Chambers manages that precarious balance of weighty, existential topics (like sapience, purpose, survival, belonging) with a wholesomeness that is neither childish nor cloying.  Even where characters might fit into well worn tropes, she gives them depth and individuality.  The entire book just feels good-natured in a way that is hard to find without feeling like you're being patronized.

While the first book in the series (The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet) took place on a tunneling ship, the Wayfarer, this second book takes place mostly on Port Coriol.  The link between the books is the Wayfarer's former AI, Lovelace (better known as Lovey).  If you haven't read the first book stop right there because the next bit will spoil the ending.  Anyway, at the end of the first book, Lovey had sustained major damage and the only way to perhaps restore her was a hard shutdown, with a 50/50 chance she would return to her Lovey personality as opposed to starting over from scratch.  Sadly for the entire crew, she reverted to Lovelace.  At the end of that book, friend of the crew Pepper (a skilled tech) had offered Lovelace the opportunity of entering into a body kit (highly illegal), and the chance to leave the crew who were mourning the loss of Lovey.  Lovelace accepted and this novel explores her attempt to live in a body and find purpose beyond her specs.

This rebirth and self-discovery finds a very effective and heart-wrenching counterpoint in alternating chapters that explore Pepper's background.  We got hints of this in the first book in the series--we know she was some kind of designed human, meant to fulfill very specific tasks and not to deviate, and that she endured a harrowing trip to escape her fate.  Here her history is elaborated with poignant detail and, over time, we come to realize why Pepper was so determined to give Lovelace a chance at another life.

The highest compliment I can give this book is that, despite loving the first book and being anxious to hear what happens next with the Wayfarer's crew, it took me less than a chapter to be entirely absorbed and not at all resentful that the Wayfarer plays no meaningful role in this novel.

From being the disowned granddaughter of a viscount to growing up and making a living through gambling Sophie was so much fun to read about. I just found her character so fascinating and she really made this book a win for me. As for Jack, he was your typical historical romance hero and in this case being typical and what I expected was a good thing because he was exactly the type of hero I love to read about when I pick up a historical romance novel. On top of two wonderful leading protagonist, the way that the author presented the love story was really something. I really loved the way that everything progressed between these two from the initial wager to them admitting their love for each other. Everything about their relationship just made me so happy. And given how happy their relationship made me, I really loved that their romance was the sole focus of this historical romance. Often in historical romance, their is always so many other things going on from conniving relatives to murder mysteries and while I do enjoy those types of stories as well, I was happy that we didn't have all that extra conflict in this book.

30981,1938,3905,"Well, this might be the most unique book I've read in a long time. Unique can either have good or bad connotations and, although I'm leaning towards good, I'm not 100% convinced with this story.

The biggest part of that indecision is that I almost always want my questions answered by the end of a story - and, in this case, that does not happen. There are open-ended trails in this book that I have to complete. But right now, this instant, I think I enjoyed this tale.

Tracy Sue Petrikoff is 17 years old. Her mother was struck by a car and killed a year ago, leaving behind Tracy, her dad, and her younger brother Scott. They live in Alaska on ten acres her grandfather built on, surrounded by thousands more acres of undeveloped Alaskan wilderness.

Even though it's not hinted at much in the blurbs of this book, this is a horror story. I won't tell you WHY it's a horror story but it is.

Strange characters, strange happenings, strange story - but I think I enjoyed it.

I really wanted to love this book as I am a big fan of suspense books and the premise of this book was super interesting, but overall it was OK. The ending saved this book for me: and, isn't that what suspense books are all about (the ending)?

Anna Fox, suffers from agoraphobia and hasn't left her house in almost a year. For entertainment she drinks (a lot)  while heavily medicated  and watches her neighbors from their respective windows: making assumptions about their lives and sometimes catching them in compromising situations. A new family, the Russells, move into one of the units and Anna witnesses something terrible go down in their home one eveningor did she? The rest, well I cant tell you that: you have to read to find out.

I had trouble with the first 75% of this book. To me, the writing was terse and often vague. Now, in a suspense read of course it should be vague (no need to tell me all the minute details that would spoil the surprise) but it wasn't used sparingly: it was the majority of the writing style. I really had no idea where this story was going to go; not in the sense of anticipating the twist, but just the overall direction of the story. An example of what I mean:

""My robe has come loose. Come undone. Shes come undone. That was a book, I believe. I never read it.""

The last 25% of the book is very strong. The ending is what made all the rest of the book make that much more sense (whoa tongue twister  say this sentence 3 times fast!). It did take me a while to get to the good part although I don't regret reading the book. You just need a bit of patience to get through the first part of the build up.

Even for its vagueness, I felt I needed to keep reading because I wanted to know how this story was going to play out. The author did a good job at that.

Its a read worth borrowing from the library or a friend.",1521504000,3,35 star realli want love book big fan suspens book premis book super interest overal ok end save book isnt suspens book end anna fox suffer agoraphobia hasnt left hous almost year entertain drink lot heavili medic watch neighbor respect window make assumpt live sometim catch compromis situat new famili russel move one unit anna wit someth terribl go home one eveningor rest well cant tell read find troubl first 75 book write ters often vagu suspens read cours vagu need tell minut detail would spoil surpris wasnt use sparingli major write style realli idea stori go go sen anticip twist overal direct stori exampl mean robe come loo come undon she come undon book believ never read last 25 book strong end made rest book make much sen whoa tongu twister say sentenc 3 time fast take get good part although dont regret read book need
30983,513,3904,"Sahara Silver had very successfully replaced her brother Scott as head of Body Armor since his disappearance, but she has always refused to believe that he was dead and she is determined to find out what happened to him. Sahara is also determined to convince Brand Berry to join the agencys sexy bodyguards. Its a job Brand would enjoy when he retires from MMA fighting, were it not for the fact that he could never work for someone as bossy as Sahara, especially given that their chemistry is off the charts and nothing ever happened between them

I loved Sahara so much, I couldn't wait to read her story, and Lori Foster does not disappoint! While FAST BURN is the fourth and last book in the Body Armor series, readers can dive right in without missing much. The sparks between Brand and Sahara had been palpable every time their paths crossed, it was only a question of how this conflagration would be handled, and I am so pleased that Ms. Foster didn't alter Saharas personality one bit. Sahara is sophisticated, capable, fearless; a true alpha female. I wish there were more heroines like her in romance novels, because Sahara is the type of heroine I really admire, especially since she never, not for one second, acted the simpering miss. Even though Brand was a tad too macho and violent to my taste, kudos to Lori Foster! Its not easy to have such two strong personalities fall in love and remain true to themselves.

We can always depend on Lori Foster for her quality writing, her crisp descriptions that do not overwhelm the narrative, solid plotting, a steady pace, and great dialogues. Although I felt that a little too much time was spent over Brands family around the middle, it was useful and interesting, but a tad too long, in my opinion. The suspense element was superbly crafted, but what astonished me the most was the complexity of the secondary characters. Ms. Foster has, in FAST BURN, some of the best villains I have ever read; they felt incredibly realistic, and it would not have taken much for the main bad guy to be a hero. I thought it was brilliant; credible villains make the heroes shine even brighter. There was one trifle that bothered me just a little, and I don't know if it will have been corrected in the final version: how tall is Enoch exactly? A few inches shorter than Sahara or a little taller? (Yes, I do tend to notice those exceedingly minor details, alas.)

Another highlight was the unusually complicated family relationships, on both Sahara and Brands sides; very different from what we are used to see, and tremendously interesting. I also very much appreciated how Sahara and Brands romance progressed: in spite of their smouldering attraction, the romance wasn't rushed, as and I expected not easy to negotiate; it was very satisfying to watch those two strong people try to compromise. While I am sad to see the Body Armor series come to a close, I know that whatever Lori Foster comes up with next, it will be another winner!

It takes off right from the start with Sahara getting kidnapped.  It only gets more interesting and chaotic as it goes along.  You have a story that has been on going and an alpha male/female bantering back and forth together with chemistry that is off the charts.

30985,1349,3904,"This was a really fun addition to the Body armor series.
Sahara is a character that we've seen in each of the previous Body Armor stories, but haven't gotten to know very well as she has always been a secondary character. Brand has also appeared in the previous books and it was great to get to know them both better here.
Fast Burn is pretty much what I would expect from Ms. Foster and this series. Brand is a very alpha, protective hero with a soft side for his special lady. Sahara is a strong heroine who learns that it's okay to lean on someone else once in a while. Building from back story created in the other books, Fast Burn launches right into the intrigue aspect of the story with the relationship and romance elements coming in a bit later.
A quick and entertaining read with great characters and strong story line, Fast Burn is a book I would definitely recommend. My only caution would be for someone just starting the series because while this story is independent, there are several points from previous books that are referenced here.

30986,597,3904,"Finally! We have a heroine who is strong, independent, and definitely able to take on an alpha male and not be left behind. Sahara inherited Body Armor when her brother turned up missing and presumed dead and she has made several changes including adding MMA fighters as bodyguards and her latest conquest is Brand, though he has been resistant at every turn. This book starts out with Sahara being kidnapped by men who insist her brother owe them money and this is just the wake up call Brand needs. Does he want to join the agency? Not necessarily but he definitely is going to get Sahara back and that he does and once he has her back he is not letting her out of his grasp. Watching these two come together was inspiring and so much FUN. I could not turn the pages fast enough! This was the best way to end this series (even though I hate to see it end) but watching Brand and Sahara find their way was worth every single minute, every single gasp, every single page.

30989,2681,3904,"Rating 4.5 Starts.

Lori Foster is so consistent. Consistently good! Ive loved Sahara since the first book in the Body Armor series. I couldn't wait for her story. Shes sassy, strong and still so sweet. Shes a phenomenal boss and friend. Of course, being strong sometimes comes off as unapproachable but Brand is strong and confident and not at all worried about going after Sahara. Shes pursuing him relentlessly to join her firm but hes just as determined to get her in his bed and life.

Of course, theres a lot of tension as well. Sahara is under attack. Brand steps up to be her personal bodyguard day and night. The situation seems to suit both their goals but who will get what they want? Foster does a fabulous job creating lots of intrigue and nail-biting action. Whos after Sahara? Is Scott, her long missing and presumed dead brother, back?

I love Brand. Hes sexy and kind behind all his strength and his cocky attitude. Ill admit, I was almost jealous of Sahara. Brand is my kind of guy. Which, of course, made the book that much more fun!

I never doubt that reading Foster is going to give me the equal parts of romance and mystery that I love. Fast Burn was all that and even more enjoyable than the first three books in the series, all of which Ive loved.",1521504000,5,rate 45 start lori foster consist consist good ive love sahara sinc first book bodi armor seri couldnt wait stori she sassi strong still sweet she phenomen bos friend cours strong sometim come unapproach brand strong confid worri go sahara she pursu relentlessli join firm he determin get bed life cours there lot tension well sahara attack brand step person bodyguard day night situat seem suit goal get want foster fabul job creat lot intrigu nailbit action who sahara scott long miss presum dead brother back love brand he sexi kind behind strength cocki attitud ill admit almost jealou sahara brand kind guy cours made book much fun never doubt read foster go give equal part romanc mysteri love fast burn even enjoy first three book seri ive love
30990,551,3904,"After her brother goes missing, Sahara Silver takes over the Body Armor Agency, with a little time and a lot of hard work she has managed to boost the business and little by little she has been able to add quite an elite group of men to the agency, all coming from the MMA world. Each man brings a special set of skills to the table, and all of them are good at what they do, but there is still one man missing from the team, Brand Berry, but he seems to want to play hard to get with the tough as nails leader. She has offered him a position with the team several times now, but he isn't so willing to walk away from the fighting world just yet, and she isn't so willing to take no for an answer, so she'll keep working on him and flirting with him, for the sake of business of course, to lure him in.

When her brother's past catches up to her, and Sahara Silver is kidnap by her brother's enemies, Brand Berry decides it's finally time to get involved with the Body Armor Agency... just not the way he wanted to. The mere thought of something happening to her unnerves him, he is determined to bring her home safely no matter the cost, and once he gets her back from her captors he isn't about to let them have a second chance at her, so he designates himself her personal bodyguard. And he takes his job very seriously, he is fully prepared to guard every single inch of her...

In this final installment in the Body Armor series you will get a deeper glimpse into the life of Sahara, the amazing heroine who runs the show, and Brand, the man who manages to steal her heart!! I loved my time with these two, their constant battles kept things steamy, and the suspenseful nature that finally pulls them together kept me flipping the pages!! It was so refreshing to read a story with a strong female heroine, one that was able to stand toe to toe with the alpha male characters in the story, and let them know just who was in charge... Sahara was a force to be reckoned with, Brand definitely had his hands full with her!! I highly recommend you get your hands on this one, with each page you turn you will find many moments that melt your heart, make you swoon, and keep you teetering on the edge of your seat!!

30991,574,3904,"Sahara and Brand have this great chemistry that made for some hilarious moments that soon gave way to tenderness. Sahara is all business. She is sharp, clever with marketing and has taken her brothers company to the next level as its new owner. The team adore her, fear her and will die to protect her. It was delightful seeing her struggle with wanting Brand on a professional level and needing him on a personal one. She never lets her guard down, and it was nice seeing the softer more vulnerable side of this strong woman. Want and need soon gave way to passion and it was delightful seeing them wrestle for power in and out of the bedroom. The suspense thread comes from the overall series arc. Saharas brother was declared dead when his boat was found at sea. Sahara has never believed him dead. Now men, one, in particular, want to know where Scott is, claiming he owes them money. When Sahara agrees to pay him, it soon becomes clear he wants something more. I have to mention how kickass Sahara is. From her attitude to quick thinking I was impressed.

Suspense and danger-filled moments are balanced against time with the team and their wives. I loved seeing Sahara with the wives and laughed aloud a few times. Foster did a great job of sharing Scotts tale and tying up threads leaving me satisfied. Brand and Saharas romance was at the heart of this story, and she gave us all the feels, growth and passion. It was hard to end this date, but I am excited to see what Foster brings us next.

30993,1030,3904,"This is the fourth book in the Body Armor series, but it works well as a standalone.

Sahara Silver took over running the Body Armor personal security agency after he brother went missing, presumed dead. She turned the agency around, hiring a number of ex-MMA fighters. She has been after Brand Berry, who hasn't left fighting yet, but he keeps rejecting her employment offers. The sexual attraction between the two is strong, but Brand will not mix business with pleasure, and Sahara knows that if she hires him, he will be off limits.

The two have been in this dance for months, but when Sahara is kidnapped, Brand immediately gets involved with Body Armor and becomes her protector.

Sahara is amazing, smart, strong, and used to getting her way. She also thinks of herself as a shark. I liked when the kidnappers told her to behave and she didn't say anything because she wasn't sure if she could behave. Brand is so alpha, but Sahara is also alpha so they keep clashing. I enjoyed the little see-saw fights, each trying to be the top dog.

I was happy to see Sahara get her own story, and finally get to know Brand.

30994,577,3904,"I really enjoyed this conclusion to the Body Armor series. All of these heroes have been around since the prior Ultimate series, and I loved seeing them come into their own as bodyguards, after prior careers as MMA fighters.

Brand Berry is still an active fighter with the SBC: the best, most famous MMA fighting organization. However, he's been debating retiring after he's had some familial obligations pop up that he wasn't expecting, with his biological mother's health. He has also been considering going to work at the Body Armor bodyguard agency, with his 3 best friends. The boss certainly wants to hire him. She's been courting him for months. The problem is, he doesn't want to work for Sahara, he just plain wants her.

Sahara Silver owns the Body Armor agency, and she's made it a premier operation that is beyond reproach. She inherited the agency from her much older brother, Scott, after he was presumed dead while out on his yacht. However, Sahara doesn't believe Scott's actually dead, and she hasn't given up looking for him. She has a PI on retainer tracking down every possible lead, and she won't give up until she finds him. Meanwhile, however, she has made the agency her own, and hired great people, especially her most recent acquisitions, 3 former MMA stars. There's a fourth man who's been playing hard to get, Brand. But she's determined to have him, one way or another.

Brand and Sahara's chemistry was fantastic, and I loved the witty banter between them. Sahara was quite an awesome and strong heroine, and I loved how she didn't really NEED Brand looking out for her, but decided she liked it anyway. Brand was still waffling on being a bodyguard, but when Sahara is kidnapped he has no hesitation about rescuing her, and keeping her safe from there on out. They really complemented each other well, even though they both really like being the boss, which caused more than a few issues between them.

The suspense plot in this book just wasn't as exciting for me as the prior ones have been, and I'm not sure why exactly. I can't pinpoint my issue with it, it just didn't strike me as suspenseful as the prior stories had been. That being said, I still enjoyed that aspect of the plot, and I loved the characters so much, that it didn't overly affect anything for me.

I love all of the side characters in this series, including the other Body Armor guards and their ladies from the prior books. I love seeing them all still happy and together after their stories have been told. The 4 guys really are great friends, and I love the dynamic between them. I also enjoyed getting to know more about Brand and his family situation. His parents were wonderful, and I loved that bit of background for him. I've been excited to learn more about Sahara from back in book 1 when she was introduced, and I loved what I learned of her in this story. Brand and Sahara really worked well together, and I loved her whole approach to her life and her business, and how she wasn't afraid of going after everything she wanted with Brand.

Overall this was a great addition to the series, and a very well done conclusion. I look forward to the next series from this author, which I'm sure will be fantastic, as always.",1521504000,4,realli enjoy conclus bodi armor seri hero around sinc prior ultim seri love see come bodyguard prior career mma fighter brand berri still activ fighter sbc best famou mma fight organ howev he debat retir he famili oblig pop wasnt expect biolog mother health also consid go work bodi armor bodyguard agenc 3 best friend bos certainli want hire she court month problem doesnt want work sahara plain want sahara silver own bodi armor agenc she made premier oper beyond reproach inherit agenc much older brother scott presum dead yacht howev sahara doesnt believ scott actual dead hasnt given look pi retain track everi possibl lead wont give find meanwhil howev made agenc hire great peopl especi recent acquisit 3 former mma star there fourth man who play hard get brand she determin one way anoth brand sahara chemistri fantast love witti banter sahara quit awesom strong heroin love didnt realli need brand look decid like anyway brand still waffl bodyguard sahara kidnap hesit

When their sons were very small, he fell in love with a much younger woman whom he called the love of my life.  They married and now have 3 daughters.  While Bill pays monthly child support, he has not seen his sons in many years.

Jackie works at a real estate agency.  She is concerned about Wade as he looks tired and perhaps stressed over school.

She learns that Liam, a high school student around Wades age, has been run down by a car.  He later dies.  The car had been hijacked by a teen boy who then sped off striking Liam who had tried to come to the aid of the woman from whom the car had been stolen.

Since the town of Havenkill is relatively small, so is their police force.  Pearl is a police officer but not necessarily a happy person.  Her partner is a young officer who grew up in the same town, knows a number of people, but tends to jump to conclusions about someones guilt or innocence.

The story follows Wade and Connor as the finger of suspicion points to Wade as the possible suspect of Liams death.  Their school mates begin to pick up on the suspicion and friends drop away and start accusing Wade on social media.  Wade does seem to be hiding something but Jackie is having a hard time getting him to talk to her even though she does her best to tell him she believes he is innocent.  Or is he?

This is a good story that shows the involvement of many in the community and the loss of Liam.  Who is the guilty person and why was he killed?

She has a ton of guts and it made my heart happy to see how protective Brand is of her. She needs a guy like him in her corner. Along with the other guys of Body Armor they have her back like she's really never had before. The suspense elements in this one had me flipping the pages to see where this story was going to go. A few twists that had me on the edge of my seat. All the characters from the previous books pop up in this one especially since the guys work for her.

31000,2162,3904,"The final entry of Lori Foster's Body Armor series is definitely the best saved for last! Fast Burn turns the attention on the big boss, Sahara Silver, as she believes against all odds that her brother is still alive and protecting her from the shadows.

Sahara has built up her brother's agency to be more appealing to a wider variety of clientele, thus the hard bodied men, who are former MMA fighters, hired to protect. One man she has yet to convince is Brand Berry, who absolutely refuses to work for her. Both Brand and Sahara have alpha mentalities, but Brand makes Sahara question her bossiness and whether she's taken it too far. However, when kidnappers hold Sahara hostage over money that her brother owes them, Brand steps in without hesitation. Now that he's stepped into the role of protector, Brand hopes to persuade Sahara into giving up her tightly held control.

I can't say that I liked Fast Burn better than Hard Justice, because I went absolutely gaga over Justice and Fallon, but it comes quite close for me. Brand and Sahara were fun and flirty and they both kicked butt! The story itself kept me on edge and tingling from all the heat and passion coming from Brand and Sahara. I really loved the antagonist's perspective thrown in the story every now and then. He was an unknown entity who made it seem like there was more to Sahara's brother's supposed death and kept the story heightened in suspense. Lori Foster's style of writing is inviting no matter what she writes. It's so easy to connect with her characters and the plot ticks all the boxes for an amazing contemporary romance you just can't put down!

Overall, Fast Burn, is not a bad way to end the Body Armor series. It's a bittersweet parting, but Lori Foster has definitely written a story to remember!

Brand is a whole new character that Sahara has her sights on. She definitely thinks he is the perfect fit for Body Armor. He just has one more fight left, but no matter what keeps declining the offer. When things become personal, the heat between these two flourish. I love the sexiness level Lori brings to the book.

31003,3157,3823,"Lake Silence is being called The Others #6, but its really more of a spinoff series. It focuses on completely different characters, with only a few minor mentions of our friends in Lakeside Courtyard. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, but its good to know up front.

For some reason, I just didn't connect to this story as much as I did the original Others SeriesI think thats mostly due to the fact that I didn't connect to Vicki, the MC, nearly as much. Shes got a lot of trust issues when it comes to men (familiar, since Meg did too, but in much different ways), but other than that, she sort of felt a little boring to me. I did love seeing more of the Others, the Elementals and the Elders thoughwhen there was supernatural activity in the book, it was pretty extreme and spectacular. But the story itself just didn't draw me in as much as I hoped. I couldn't get over the fact that the people who were trying to take advantage of Vicki were just being incredibly stupid.

31004,882,1670,"What is it like to live with Alzheimers disease?  To know that you have it, and are forgetting the everyday matters of life?  To think that one day you will forget your children and your spouse?

Alice Howland is a psychology professor at Howard and has had great success in her field.  She loves teaching and being a partner with her husband, also a Harvard professor.  They have three beautiful children in their 20s off on their own attending school or starting careers.  Alice starts to forget things more often, cumulating in going for a run and not recognizing the neighborhood that she has been running through and living in most her life.  She goes to a doctor to determine what is wrong and is diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimers disease.  Alice breaks the news to her family and tries to make the best choices to still be able to live her life to the fullest before it is too late.

Alice has the disease at a much earlier age than my Great Grandpa who was in his 80s battling the disease.  As a professor of psychology, she is keenly aware of what is going to happen to her.  I loved that she made her own group of other early on-set Alzheimers patients to support each other. I also enjoyed that the book was told from her point of view as she declined with the disease.  I was both amazed and infuriated by the reactions of her family.  I love that her strained relationship with her youngest daughter seems to strengthen with the disease.  I felt for her husband, but was also infuriated by decisions that he made.  It would be a very difficult situation to be in.

Favorite Quotes:

Her mother had comforted her and told her not to be sad for the butterflies, that just because their lives were short didn't mean they were tragic.  Watching them flying in the warm sun among the daisies in their garden, her mother had said to her, see they have a beautiful life. Alice liked remembering that.

Her sense of Alice  what she knew and understood, what she liked and disliked, how she felt and perceived  was also like a soap bubble, ever higher in the sky and more difficult to identify, with nothing by the thinnest lipid membrane protecting it from popping into thinner air.

There is no peace in being unsure of everything all of the time.  I miss doing everything easily.  I miss being a part of whats happening.  I miss feeling wanted.  I miss my life and my family.  I loved my life and family.

Overall, Still Alice was a touching look at Alices battle with early on set Alzheimers and how it affected her and her family.  I like that this book brings Alzheimers into focus and into discussion.  I feel like this disease and Dementia are not understood and the victims are often blamed for something they cant control.  Or forgotten because its easier to deal with that way.

The only thing I didn't like was the way the author portrayed the inner thoughts of the characters. They were long-winded paragraphs that really weren't natural as thoughts. Maybe that's just me though. I also didn't like the ending of this book. I don't want to give away too much but it one of my favorite things about the story gets taken out of play.

I really enjoyed the set-up, where Sylvie and Dan get their insurance physicals, only to find out from the loquacious doctor that are they super healthy, and will probably live to 100+. When he tells them that is about 68 more years of marriage, their reactions to the news set the stage for a series of 'surprises' to keep things fresh and to propel the book with what are sure to be misunderstandings too.

31014,2376,2961,"Joy Fielding is known for her skill in grabbing the reader and make them keep turning page after page. The Bad Daughter is no different in that aspect.

The book starts with an interesting premise: Robin left her hometown and dysfunctional family years ago and has been estranged from her family ever since. A call from Melanie, her older sister, says ""Call me."" When Robin does, she learns that her father, his new wife and her child have all been shot in what is suspected to be a home invasion. Even given the seriousness of the call, Robin debates with herself momentarily as to whether she should return. There were good reasons why she left, and going home won't be easy.

Where the book fell short for me was the unusually flat one-dimensional characters, and the soap-opera like sub-stories (Robin's father is now married to Robin's childhood best friend, a friendship that ended when Tara broke off her engagement to Robin's brother Alec, and married Robin's father months after his wife's death. You can almost hear the music in the background, can't you?)

The book held my interest until the end, but is not one of Joy Fielding's best (or better) offerings.

31016,630,2961,"There was no shortage of words she could use to describe her father, almost none of them complimentary. Serves you damn right, she thought.

  A voice mail from her estranged sister, Melanie, sends Robins heart racing and her mind spiraling in a full-blown panic attack. Melanies message is dire: Their father, his second wife, and his twelve-year-old stepdaughter have been shotlikely in a home invasionand lie in the hospital in critical condition.

  Its been more than five years since Robin turned her back on her father when he married her best friend. Five years since she said goodbye to her hometown of Red Bluff, California, and became a therapist. More than two years since Robin and Melanie have spoken. Yet even with all that distance and time and acrimony, the past is always with Robin.

  Now she must return to the family she left behind. As she attempts to mend fences while her father clings to life, Robin begins to wonder if there is more to the tragedy than a botched burglary attempt. It seems that everyoneRobins mercurial sister, her less-than-communicative nephew, her absent brother, and even Tara, her fathers wifehas something to hide. And someone may have put them all in grave danger.

My Thoughts: There is no better story than one created by Joy Fielding, in my opinion, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bad-Daughter-A-Novel/dp/B0728MK7WS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bad Daughter: A Novel</a>&nbsp;is no exception. From the beginning, I found myself rapidly turning pages, staying up late to read more, and then enjoying every surprise twist and turn until the very end.

The characters felt so real, and I had emotional reactions to them all. I couldn't stand Melanie, Robins older sister, whose sarcasm seemed to come from a very bad place. But did she have good reasons for her behavior?

I wasn't sure about Robins fianc Blake, either, but I gradually came to see a different side to him.

Then there was Melanies autistic son Landon, who, at eighteen, had all the usual behaviors associated with his disorderbut there was also something about him that aroused discomfort. Was he keeping secrets?

The victims in the shooting all had plenty of bad qualities, except for the twelve year old victim Cassidy, who seemed like a sweet innocent. But was there more to her story? Robin was drawn to her, but often had a feeling of whats wrong with this picture?

Until the riveting and surprising conclusion, I went back and forth about which character must be pegged as the bad daughter, but when the final reveal came, it all made sense.

31017,2649,1521,"THIS is the kind of book I DO NOT read. I subscribe to Agatha Christie's belief that there should be NO romance in mystery.  Add to that - Futuristic Police Procedural? NO!  But toward the end of last year, this book was designated for Book Club....and I got totally, absolutely hooked!

I believe that this series is best when read in order.  Book 1 grabbed me (and I would later find that the series gets BETTER-WAY-BETTER than Book 1 as it progresses.)  Naked In Death (Book 1) introduces the characters and allows the reader to adjust to the slightly futuristic elements (gun control at last!).  The year is 2058 - not that big a jump.

There is a bit of a Jules Verne or Aldous Huxley going on here; the book was written in 1995 and we now have, in reality, many of the futuristic items described by Robb. Eve Dallas is our ""heroine"" - a Lieutenant with the N.Y. Police Department - tall, strong utterly The Best Cop - but flawed due to childhood abuse.  (Yes, I know - most of us have heard it before. But it works well here.) The true ""fantasy"" comes with Roark, Leading Man Extraordinaire, who is one of the suspects in Eve's investigation of the death of a ""Licensed Companion"" - legal prostitute.

Robb lays the groundwork for her series very well, and by the end of this book, I was more than willing to ""suspend disbelief"" and enjoy this and other entries into series.  (I confess: I am now on Book 5.)  I  think the series tops out (so far) with -In Death #46.

There is a solid whodunnit mystery here--it is all not gimmickry. There are suspects - red herrings too.  And the surprise ending works well (I couldn't guess the guilty party.)

LOTS of fun and solid mystery here!  Get ready to become ""hooked"" - as I was!

A Brush with Shadows, the sixth book in the Lady Darby Mystery series, is marvelous. With strong, exquisitely developed characters, stellar writing, and lavish descriptions that are both atmospheric and evocative, the Moors, Kiera, and Gage will haunt you long after the last word is read.

Still on their honeymoon, Kiera and Gage travel from to Dartmoor at the urgent request of Gages grandfather. Gage has been estranged from his family since his mothers death and has not been home since he was eighteen years old.  Family loyalty and curiosity bring him back to where he never thought he would be again. Gage is surprised to find his grandfather gravely ill, his Aunt Vanessa as acid-tongued as ever, and his cousin Alfred missing.  It has been two weeks since Alfred disappeared, and everyone is beginning to think he met an untimely, possibly foul end. Facing secrets that no one wants revealed, hints of witchcraft, a curse, family expectations, and poison, Kiera and Gage together confront danger to reveal the truth.

We see Gage at his most vulnerable, and we learn a great deal about his past which helped make him the man he is today. Gages experiences are heartbreaking. He has always held his cards close to his chest, making him mysterious. Sharing his past with Kiera is probably the most intimate they have ever been.  There is still some romance within the pages, they are newlyweds after all, and the mystery is important throughout the book, but the character interactions and the austere setting are what hold this tale together.  Kiera continues to grow more confident and asserts herself well here. Hubers attention to detail is stunning. Her prose draws the reader in, and I felt like I was there on the Moors with mist swirling about me as the cold seeped into my bones. The Moors are indeed a magical place.

Unfortunately, said young woman is vapid and the author tries far too hard to make her witty. But it's not just an unlikable lead (a number of authors expertly write an unlikable main character) that Sally Franson fails at, she also summarizes important scenes rather than letting them play out on the page. For example, Franson gives a brief description of what Casey says to her mother, then has the mother begin to cry and declare that Casey sounds just like her much-loathed father. It would be helpful for the reader to know just what Casey said to trigger such a response.

31030,637,3508,"The French Girl is Lexie Elliott's debut novel.

Six Oxford students spent a summer vacation together in France ten years ago. They were friends - and friends with benefits.. Their getaway doesn't go quite as planned - a beautiful French girl named Severine who lived next to the villa changes the dynamic of the group. And now she's changing the future. Ten years on, the police have found Severine's body in a well on the vacation property. The group is now part of a murder investigation by the French police.

Kate Channing is one of those six and she is our narrator.  Elliott slowly ekes out the details of what happened that summer week. Something happened that irrevocably changed each of the six. Kate herself sees Severine as a presence and although she does not speak, Kate gives her emotions.

""Severine glances at him with disdain, and suddenly I wonder: if Severine is a creation of my mind, are her reactions my own deeply hidden feelings?""

The friends are still in contact with each other. Our sense of who they are is coloured by Kate's views. I found them to all be flawed and not overly likable. But could one of them be a murderer? It is the relationships between them that takes center stage in the book. Elliott's depiction of those bonds, memories, interactions and current sparring is excellent. She is a gifted writer.

The publisher has described The French Girl as ""exhilarating psychological suspense"". I enjoyed The French Girl, but found it to be a bit of a slow burn rather than a fast paced suspense read. But, that slow burn absolutely works for exploring the relationships.

I cant identify exactly what it is that didn't work for me with this book but theres something about it that just rubs against my grain. Maybe its because its too predictable or because the answers are too pat.

31053,882,444,"Have you ever had a book that sat on your to read list for twenty years and you aren't quite sure why?  A Wrinkle in Time is just such a book for me.  My little sister Katie highly recommended it to me while I was in college and even loaned me her copy, but I never got a chance to read it.  Its always been in the back of my mind, and with the new movie coming out, it seemed like now was the perfect time to read it.

This book has time travel and a female protagonist, which would have been totally up my ally as a teen / pre-teen, Im not sure how I missed it.  Originally published in 1962, I am amazed at how this book is before its time.  Not only is the main character of this sci-fi novel a female, but her mother is also a PhD scientist that works as an equal partner with her husband.  Very cool.

Meg never fits in anywhere.  Besides feeling that she looks odd and she doesnt like the regular material at school, her father vanished without explanation years before causing much talk around town.  After a mysterious visitor appears, Meg together with her brother Charles Wallace and friend Calvin, travel through time and space to find her father.

I loved that the story not only was a cool time travel story, but was also a great coming of age story as Meg tries to find and like herself.  I really liked the explanation of the travel through space and time using drawings.

Favorite Quotes:

Yes.  I believe that they do.  But I think that with our human limitations were not always able to understand the explanations.  But you see, Meg, just because we don't understand doesnt mean that the explanation doesnt exist.

A book, too, can be a start, explosive material, capable of stirring up fresh life endlessly, a living fire to lighten the darkness, leading out into the expanding universe.  a quote from LEngles Newbery Medal Acceptance Speech from 1963.  It is a wonderful speech about the love of reading and the love of fantasy/sci-fi.  Its worth reading on its own!!

Overall, A Wrinkle in Time is a classic sci-fi / fantasy novel that deals with time travel, and also understanding yourself and what it means to love.  I thought it was a great unique story, especially for the time it was written.  Its interesting how many tales that came after it borrowed parts of it.  I think the movie looks really interested and I cant wait to see it!

31065,668,2522,"This is a combination of a narrative poem and a collection of morality poems. The story of the narrative poem is that a wise man (i.e. the Prophet), Almustafa, is about to sail away from his recent -- but temporary -- home on Orphalese, and hes asked to speak on a range of topics so the people of Orphalese can gather his wisdom before he goes.

In 26 chapters, the prophet expounds on each topic upon which he is questioned. Topics include relationships, possessions, laws, religion, teaching, and death.  The wisdom presented is practical, profound, and reflects a mystic sentiment (i.e. the idea that the divine is within us rather than something separate.)  This is an extremely quotable volume. Among his responses, the Prophet says that one should not be too controlling in relationships, that one should not live life under the dictates of fear,  that its not for one to determine what is moral for another, and that one should not engage in morality or worship for show.

31069,3442,2595,"Like many books I find myself reading lately, what first caught my attention about Your One & Only was the striking cover. It immediately grabbed my interest, as well as giving me a pretty good idea of what the book was about (which is a bonus, if you ask me). Plus its just so pretty, and who can say no to a pretty book cover? (I know I cant).
 What kept my attention however, was the plot. Hundreds of years after all the humans on earth have died off, all thats left are colonies of clones; modified copies of their progenitors. And then theres Jack. He technically is a clone too, but since his genes haven't been modified, hes more human than they are. What would a world look like, where theres only one human in a sea of clones?
 As far as post apocalypse stories go, Your One & Only is probably one of the brighter and shinier societies Ive seen. Though that doesnt exactly mean the society itself is well functioning, does it? When the humans died off so did many of their hobbies, traditions, and knowledge. The colonies left, all clones, got to pick and choose what they wanted to keep, and for the most part they chose to reject humanity.
 Its an interesting concept to mull over; a society of clones that not only altered their preferences, history, and purpose, but also their very DNA. One would be hard pressed to argue that this society is humans; but I would urge you not to call them clones either (apparently they don't like that  go figure).
 One of our main characters, Althea-310, is one of these clones (woops, I shouldnt call them that, I know). She is one of ten Altheas for her generation, with ten generations in total. Each generation is made up of nine different clone types, with their own looks, personalities, and purposes. If that wasn't sci-fi enough for you, hows this; each set of clones can communicate telepathically.
 That brings us to the other main character; Jack. He is one of one. There aren't another nine of him to make a full set, and more importantly he was copied directly from human DNA, no editing or perfectly done to him. The question is, why? Why did they make Jack, when society appears so perfect? Why do they need him?
 The unfolding mysteries and secrets of this colony were harrowing and fascinating. I had my own personal theories throughout, some of which were spot onothers less so. I love the thought provoking nature of the story, and it raises many subjects for debate. Ethically speaking, is cloning justified? What if it was to preserve human nature? Even if the clones turn their back on humans? And what of the clones created; what do we owe them? What responsibility to we have over them, and what treatment should they expect? And the clones made by clones? Are they open to the same level of treatment?
 If you enjoy mulling over those sorts of questions, then youll probably enjoy reading Your One & Only. Ill admit at times it was more toned down than I think it should have been (softening the impact, so to speak), but at the same time Im almost relieved it didn't go any heavier than it already had.
 Your One & Only was Adrianne Finlays debut novel, so obviously I haven't read anything else by her, but I have to say Im impressed. Ill likely be keeping an out for future books from her, as I think theyll be just as interesting as this one.",1521504000,4,like mani book find read late first caught attent one strike cover immedi grab interest well give pretti good idea book bonu ask plu pretti say pretti book cover know cant kept attent howev plot hundr year human earth die that left coloni clone modifi copi progenitor there jack technic clone sinc gene havent modifi he human would world look like there one human sea clone far post apocalyps stori go one probabl one brighter shinier societi ive seen though doesnt exactli mean societi well function human die mani hobbi tradit knowledg coloni left clone got pick choos want keep part chose reject human interest concept mull societi clone alter prefer histori purpos also dna one would hard press argu societi human would urg call clone either appar dont like go figur one main charact althea310 one clone woop shouldnt call know one ten althea gener ten gener total

The servants accompanying the trio are dead and no evidence of their whereabouts remains.  Makiia Lucier continues the novel as she shifts the story to that of Antonis son Elias and his best friend, the now King of St. John del Mar, Ulises.  Discovery of a detailed map by a young girl, Reyna, spurs Elias to seek the truth about his fathers disappearance and propels the story through to its conclusion.

Interesting characters and the maintaining of the mystery until the last quarter of the novel make Isle of Blood and Stone a fascinating read.  Language and descriptions, with several exceptions, are appropriate for most readers.  The exceptions are the use of several arcane profanities, the violent punishment of a traitor, and the disparaging hints at the relationship between two women.  None of those passages was necessary to the story, nor did they add to the overall depth of the novel.

Reeve is great at broad stroke world building. He creates the London traction city in a chapter or two. He shows us all of the levels, how it works, how people fit into it, and the larger world within which it operates, and he frames all of the major characters within the first 50 pages. After that we are off to the races on a high energy, twisty and marvelously colorful adventure.

And this is a marvelous adventure. Our hero is a bit timid but finds the swashbuckler within. Our heroine is tough, smart, resourceful, and on a mission. This is a fine team. Around and through them we meet a memorable cast of colorful and compelling allies and villains. This is ripping stuff. Lots of running, hiding, lurking, escaping, fighting, and derring do. I was a bit surprised by the level of violence, and not cartoon violence, in the story, but that's treated as a serious consequence of dangerous times and this is still, after all, a dystopian world tale.

So, I enjoyed this immensely and appreciated the high level of imagination and creative energy that went into building and then convincingly portraying this fascinating world.",1521504000,4,read enjoy steampunk sometim im mood expect young reader might mood lovingli detail descript world build get page page descript clockwork contrapt whole chapter devot tour steam power engin room that get reev great broad stroke world build creat london traction citi chapter two show u level work peopl fit larger world within oper frame major charact within first 50 page race high energi twisti marvel color adventur marvel adventur hero bit timid find swashbuckl within heroin tough smart resourc mission fine team around meet memor cast color compel alli villain rip stuff lot run hide lurk escap fight der bit surpris level violenc cartoon violenc stori that treat seriou consequ danger time still dystopian world tale enjoy immens appreci high level imagin creativ energi went build convincingli portray fascin world

31074,2826,3906,"The Lynley novels have never been among my favorite mysteries, but somehow I keep coming back to them. It's the lure of any series, I guess -- once you start, it's hard to stop. Still, I've missed quite a few of these, and now it looks as if I'll have to find the one where Lynley and Havers go to Italy, since that promises to figure in the next novel. As for this one, it's long, very long. 700 pages in hardcover. But oddly enough, I really didn't mind and I enjoyed reading the whole thing, even if I wasn't tearing through it like a thriller. I liked reading it for an hour or so a day over the space of a week.

The mystery is a good one and I never twigged to which bloke was the culprit. You see what I did there -- Elizabeth George, who is an American, makes sure all the characters sound super British. No one ever ""gets"" something, they always ""fetch"" it, if someone addresses more than one person, it's always ""you lot,"" and people are endlessly ""twigging,"" ""chuffed to bits,"" and so on. No one sounds as British as Elizabeth George, not Ruth Rendell or Agatha Christie or Tana French, no one.

If there's a theme in The Punishment She Deserves, it's bad parenting, especially bad mothers. Evil Stepmothers are nothing compared to mothers who mean well but get it spectacularly wrong. Scary stuff.

31076,3024,3907,"I'm trying to read up on possible Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential race. Mitch Landrieu, currently mayor of New Orleans and formerly Lt Governor of Louisiana, has been mentioned as a dark horse, lurking on the edges of the political landscape. Landrieu's new book, ""In the Shadow of Statues: A White Southerner Confronts History"", is a good look at three major issues that he has handled in his time in the two major offices he has held in Louisiana.

Landrieu writes about his family - his father Moon was for many years mayor of New Orleans - and his liberal upbringing. Born in 1960 - one of nine children to Moon and Vera Landrieu - Mitch went to Catholic schools and colleges and eventually became a lawyer, like his father. He entered politics on a state legislative level and ran for and won higher state offices. As Lt Governor under Kathleen Blanco, he participated in the cleanup of the Katrina hurricane in 2005. He names names on the people he felt were not helpful - Mayor Ray Nagin - is held up as basically worthless. Katrina is the first of the three issues Landrieu writes about in depth; the other two are the Confederate Monuments and the problems in the black area of New Orleans.

Okay, the thing you can ask is ""how honest is Mitch Landrieu?"" I don't know but these pre-election books are never, and I mean NEVER, written with anything other than self-aggrandizement. The time for complete honesty in a political memoir comes, if it does come at all, in a final memoir after a politician has left public life. Mitch Landrieu's book is an interesting look at the life of a white Southern liberal politician. He's a good writer and I think he was probably as honest as he could be.

31077,557,3906,"Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers work well together, although they are vastly different in appearance and behavior.  Havers is unkempt, impulsive, and laces her speech with off-color remarks.  Lynley, on the other hand, is immaculately attired, urbane, and dignified.  Despite their dissimilarities, Lynley and Havers have a great deal in common. Both are insightful, thorough, and more interested in attaining justice than in kowtowing to their superiors.

Lynley is largely absent at the beginning of Elizabeth George's ""The Punishment She Deserves."" An unhappy Havers is forced to take a wretched road trip out of London with her nemesis, Detective Chief Superintendent Isabelle Ardery. DCS Ardery has contempt for Havers, whom she hopes to transfer to a remote outpost as a punishment for Barbara's impudence and disobedience. Ardery and Havers arrive in the town of Ludlow to determine whether members of local law enforcement mishandled the investigation into the alleged suicide of Deacon Ian Druitt, a much beloved clergyman and humanitarian. Clive Druitt, Gerald's well-connected and wealthy father, is putting pressure on New Scotland Yard to reopen the case and find out what really happened to his son.

This novel is a whopping six-hundred-and ninety pages, far longer than it needs to be.  The characters include a delusional alcoholic; a community support officer who keeps a close eye on Ludlow's citizenry; two mothers obsessed with micromanaging the lives of their grown children; and a group of self-destructive, hard-drinking, and promiscuous college-age kids.  Although the writing is serviceable, the author, who is American, is too eager to show off her command of British slang and idioms. (One irritant is her use of the words ""full stop"" at least a dozen times.)  There is a bit of gentle humor provided by Barbara Havers who, in spite of having two left feet, is pushed by a colleague into taking tap dancing lessons. Those who have admired Lynley and Havers for years will want to read ""The Punishment She Deserves,"" but not everyone will be mesmerized by this heavy-handed and awkwardly constructed tale of deceit, family dysfunction, corruption, and sexual exploitation.",1521504000,3,detect inspector thoma lynley detect sergeant barbara haver work well togeth although vastli differ appear behavior haver unkempt impuls lace speech offcolor remark lynley hand immacul attir urban dignifi despit dissimilar lynley haver great deal common insight thorough interest attain justic kowtow superior lynley larg absent begin elizabeth georg punish deserv unhappi haver forc take wretch road trip london nemesi detect chief superintend isabel arderi dc arderi contempt haver hope transfer remot outpost punish barbara impud disobedi arderi haver arriv town ludlow determin whether member local law enforc mishandl investig alleg suicid deacon ian druitt much belov clergyman humanitarian clive druitt gerald wellconnect wealthi father put pressur new scotland yard reopen case find realli happen son novel whop sixhundredand nineti page far longer need charact includ delusion alcohol commun support offic keep close eye ludlow citizenri two mother ob micromanag live grown child group selfdestruct harddrink promiscu collegeag kid although write servic author american eager show command british slang idiom one irrit use word full stop least dozen time bit gentl humor provid barbara haver spite two

Shes fighting with her ex-husband who is determined to move out of the country with their two sons and Arderys been hitting the vodka bottle too often.  Shes also determined to finally find enough reason to call for the transfer of Havers out of her district.

Ive have been a fan of this author since her first book many years ago.  Ms. George is a master at meticulously plotting out her complex mysteries, but where she truly excels is in her characters.  If you decide to read something by this author, and I hope you do, you should start with her first book, A Great Deliverance, so you have a good understanding of the background of each of the characters and can grow to love them as I have.  Her newest book is a long one, over 700 pages on my Kindle, but youll get no complaints about that from me as the more time I spend with these characters, the happier I am.  This is a complex tale and one of the best that this author has written.  I became totally engrossed in the mystery and I so very much enjoyed Ms. Georges humorous telling of Havers attempts at tap dancing.  Ms. George remains my favorite English mystery writer (though shes American).  Im already longing for her next book.

31083,3877,3543,"FEELS!!!!!!!! ALL THE FEELS!!!!!!!!!! The Astonishing Color of After brought to light feelings for me that I didn't know I was feeling. I cried tears I didn't know I needed to cry. This book resonated with me in ways Ive never experience before while reading. This book rebroke my heart but it also healed it in ways I couldn't heal myself.
Let me start at the beginning Leighs mother commits suicide. Her moms name is Dorothy and goes by Dory for short. While my mom didn't commit suicide, she did die unexpectedly in August of 2016. I know, I know you're thinking what does this have to do with the book but just put your patient pants on. My moms name was Doria, and she went by Dory. While Leigh was lucky enough to be the one that didn't find her mom, I wasn't lucky enough to have the same luxury. I could relate to how Leigh was feeling on so many levels. So much so, it felt like the author had interviewed me and then written the book based on that interview. Leigh feels like she is to blame partly for her mothers death. She feels like if she would have only done x better, if only shed been in y place at z time she would have been able to save her mom. I know because I had these same thoughts and still do until this day. After reading this book and realizing there just wasn't anything I could have done to change the outcome of what was destined to happen. But just because my mom isn't physically here anymore doesnt mean shes gone forever. I still see her in myself every time I look in the mirror. She is always with me.
The magical realism aspect of this book brought the journey and the imagery to life for me. I could picture this big beautiful red bird soaring around Leigh. The more I read of this book the more I found myself looking to the sky to see what is out there for me, and then I realized that looking to the sky is something that Ive done since the day my mom died. I find myself looking around at the clouds and the sky seeing if there is a trace of her looking down on me. Now my favorite time to look to the sky is at night and I imagine her as one of the stars looming overhead keeping an eye on me.
The characters in this book are so real. Leigh, her grandparents, her dad, and Axel. Though, I must admit I feel as though the story could have been just as good without Axel. Sometimes he just seemed to crowd the story and take away from what was happening. I think my most favorite character was Feng, and all the she represents. I absolutely loved this aspect of the book. I also loved Ghost Month as this was something I had never heard of before and it and it reminds me of one of my other favorite holidays El Dia de los Muertos. I loved learning about the Taiwanese culture.
The way the author wove this story together through her words brought the magic and the storytelling to life. Her writing style worked extremely well for the subject of this story and I cant wait to see what she is going to write in the future. The only aspect of this story that just didn't mesh for me was all the colors sprinkled throughout the story. Honestly though, that is such a minute detail that its barely worth mentioning.
As you can see this story hit me very close to home, and I am so incredibly grateful to the author for writing it. It rebroke my heart and then helped to heal that same broken heart.
Now, on to the important bits Suicide If you are ever in a position where you feel that you just absolutely cant go on do me one solid. Pause. Pick up your phone, and text HELP to 741741. This is the number for the Crisis Text Line. You will be connected to one of their trained Crisis Counselors.

31084,1607,3543,"Generally, I avoid straight-up YA fiction  I will read YA fantasy, but mostly I don't want to read about school drama  unless its from an author that I know that I like. But, in the few months that I have been an official member of the Book of the Month club, I have to say that I have agreed and have been impressed with their selections  and when I saw a spoiler that this book would be one of their March choices, I knew that I wanted to read this one. And the writing itself is impressive from the very start! Its lyrical, lovely and just downright beautifully breathtaking in places! I am impressed and only continued to be more so, the further in that I got!

Earlier this year, I had doubted that magical realism still worked for me. When I was younger, I loved this device/approach in novels, but lately, I just haven't been able to really feel invested in it. But this book has proven that completely wrong  I love it! After the suicide of her mother, Leigh is convinced that her mother has been transformed into a bird. This sets the premise for the whole novel and brings her from her American home to Taipei to meet her maternal grandparents for the first time.

This is just a totally immersive, absolutely absorbing read! And though, at its heart, this is a book about grief  its also deliciously filled with color, art  and hope. After all, it is just this that as Emily Dickinson attests is the thing with wings, and what else would a mother-transformed-into-a-bird, be but that? It also has a lot of interesting facts about Taiwan, China and some cultural history as well. It really is a breathtaking novel, and one that I cant recommend enough.

31090,617,3504,"About That Kiss is the fifth book in the Heartbreaker Bay series, of which I have only read one book. While these may technically be read as standalones, I felt like I was missing info and wish I had read all the earlier books first. There is quite a bit of character crossover and references to their stories (particularly the fateful fountain) and, as I didn't know everyone, I felt like I was the clueless new kid on the block.

So this story is about a kiss (duh) that seems to have happened off-page... or maybe in a previous book? We start off the story two days after the kiss has happened. I wish that scene had been included in a prologue or something because I felt like I was coming into the story late. So the gist is that our heroine (Kylie) and hero (Joe) had a steamy, possibly drunken, kiss at a bar. Then he didn't call her, but comes into her reclaimed wood store a couple days after.
Kylie Masters is a woodworker, making pieces for a quaint store called Reclaimed Wood. She is following in her grandfather's footsteps, who was a master woodworker and raised Kylie. This is pretty unique for a heroine, so I liked that aspect and envied her creative/crafty ability. Sometimes Kylie seemed anti-romance, but then there were also mentions about her huge crush on her boss, Gibbs. She has a close-knit group of girlfriends, which I also envied. (It's so hard to find a good girl posse as an adult! But I digress.)

Joe Malone is kind of a tortured hero. He is also anti-romance, but it has more to do with how he seems himself than what he really has to offer a mate. But Joe espouses all the characteristics of a good hero. He is tough and capable, protective, caring, and a little bit vulnerable. After a rough childhood, Joe is working in the investigation and security field with some of the earlier heroes of the series (I think). He also takes care of his mentally ill father and slightly disabled sister, and has served as the bedrock of the family from a young age.

The romance between these two was at arm's length much of the time. They tried to deny their feelings, were deathly afraid of the town wishing fountain, but ultimately give in to the chemistry. I thought they were pretty good when they were together, but neither had the courage to communicate with the other. Luckily they had the investigation to fall back on, as that kept pushing them together as I'm sure they would have never talked otherwise.

I didn't feel like there was a lot of character development in this book, and it kept me from connecting with either character. In fact, the heroine kinda got on my nerves. So I'm thinking that there may have been some character building throughout the series that I missed, as I don't recall this being an issue in other Shalvis books that I've read. I also felt like the suspense aspect was a bit weak. If I am reading romantic suspense, I tend to want the heart-pounding action and suspense... where this one was just a little mystery investigation.

So while I usually like Jill Shalvis' books, this one was just okay for me. It didn't hold my interest well and I kept taking breaks during my roadtrip to listen to other books.",1521504000,3,kiss fifth book heartbreak bay seri read one book may technic read standalon felt like miss info wish read earlier book first quit bit charact crossov refer stori particularli fate fountain didnt know everyon felt like clueless new kid block stori kiss duh seem happen offpag mayb previou book start stori two day kiss happen wish scene includ prologu someth felt like come stori late gist heroin kyli hero joe steami possibl drunken kiss bar didnt call come reclaim wood store coupl day kyli master woodwork make piec quaint store call reclaim wood follow grandfath footstep master woodwork rais kyli pretti uniqu heroin like aspect envi creativecrafti abil sometim kyli seem antirom also mention huge crush bos gibb closeknit group girlfriend also envi hard find good girl po adult digress joe malon kind tortur hero also antirom seem realli offer mate joe espous characterist

31094,1713,1008,"I enjoyed this book a lot more than I expected to. And a big reason why is that although its a sci fi fantasy novel set in the future circa 2045, the framework of the virtual setting that is highly featured throughout the book (known as The Oasis) uses the 1980s as a reference point. And I grew up in the 80s so found that aspect of the book really appealing!! The music, movies, games, clothing and culture of the 80s essentially becomes a character.

31098,1173,2389,"I have FINALLY read Carrie, Stephen Kings first book. Yes, it was his FIRST book!
Reading a book when you already know the story so well (from the movie) is such a different experience than reading the book and then watching the movie, but its even more different when its one like this. Ive seen Carrie so many times because its one of my favorite horror films (not talking about any stupid remake, despite the fact I happen to have the book copy that is the remake movie tie-in. Remakes of good films are blasphemy). The original movie is perfection with Piper Laurie and Sissy Spacek and when reading the book, is was VERY hard for me not to get their images out of my mind. It was brilliant casting, for a brilliant story.
When reading this pretty short book (it comes in at basically 300 pages, which is so short, when you compare it to the behemoths of IT and The Stand), you are transported to 1979 immediately by the language, the descriptions of the clothing, and even the comparative style of Kings writing. Its kind of a treat and a bit of a time warp you are pulled into. It took a bit of getting used to, along with the way King uses different narrative styles; the reader is given reports of the main incident, as well as character accounts, and intersperses them into the main story. If you didn't know the ending from seeing the movie, you would have a good idea about a lot of it from these accounts as you go through.
As for the dynamic between Carrie and her hellacious (sorry, have to say it) mother, the interactions are horrific and they make your blood boil and King has given all he can to make the dread and tension so vivid. By writing in Carries thoughts we get little peeks into whats going on in her mind as her powers are getting stronger; you start rooting for the girl who is being bullied, dominated, threatened all her life. You just know that there is no other way for this story to end.
What is most interesting to me now is the contrast with what what acceptable in terms of what kids could get away with (in terms of bullying and hazing) at school, compared to now. Thats a whole other story.
Anyway, Im glad I finally got to read it as part of a Litsy buddy read. I love the movie so much, and its amazing to think that this is where Stephen Kings book career started. With a short novel that had one of most memorable horror movies made out of it.

Joe is a former Marine and also previously an FBI agent.  A very abusive childhood has left him mentally damaged beyond any real chance of repair.  He lives with his grandmother in the borough of Queens, New York city and is as much a loner as any human can be.  He earns a livelihood through the act of rescuing young girls from kidnapping and being forced into prostitution.

  The novel opens as he successfully completes one assignment and receives another job rescuing the daughter of a New York State senator.  The senator himself talks to him and advises that the girl is being held in a brothel in Manhattan by the mob.  The assignment leads Joe into a situation that involves criminal mobs, and high level conspiracy.

  Mr. Ames successfully paints a picture of a world very different than the one most of us inhabit.  It is brutal, unforgiving and violent to a degree unknown to the average person.  The novel in addition to being a tie-in to the film is definitely one that is leading to another book continuing Joe's activities in this violent underground  world.

31118,789,3904,"Fast Burn by Lori Foster is the fourth and final book in the Body Armor series.

We first met Sahara Silver in book one (Under Pressure). In Fast Burn we finally get to know the truth about her brother, Scott, the original owner of the Body Armor Agency after Saharas life is put in danger.
We also get to watch as Sahara tries to talk Brand Berry into becoming a bodyguard, except Brand has other plans. Namely, Sahara herself. Their interest in one another became apparent in Close Contact and now it flares to life.

Brand is adamant at being in charge of their relationship since he hasn't agreed to work for Sahara. Like all Ms. Fosters heroes, Brand is the quintessential alpha-protector, not only toward Sahara and making sure whoever is after her doesnt get too close again, but toward his parents as well. With them, we see more than just the MMA fighter slash protector.
Sahara is fierce and independent and learns she doesnt have to be in charge all the time.

With the romance between Sahara and Brand flaming hot and with Saharas life in danger from a motley crew of thugs, Fast Burn has more twists than a country road and keeps you guessing until the final chapter.
Ms. Foster has done a fantastic job in concluding the Body Armor series.

The story of the narrative poem is that a wise man (i.e. the Prophet), Almustafa, is about to sail away from his recent -- but temporary -- home on Orphalese, and hes asked to speak on a range of topics so the people of Orphalese can gather his wisdom before he goes.

In 26 chapters, the prophet expounds on each topic upon which he is questioned. Topics include relationships, possessions, laws, religion, teaching, and death.  The wisdom presented is practical, profound, and reflects a mystic sentiment (i.e. the idea that the divine is within us rather than something separate.)  This is an extremely quotable volume. Among his responses, the Prophet says that one should not be too controlling in relationships, that one should not live life under the dictates of fear,  that its not for one to determine what is moral for another, and that one should not engage in morality or worship for show.

It is written by an English speaking magazine reporter fluent in Chinese and able to transliterate names, and this chronicling is also documented and footnoted.
Follow along with the poorlt educated young man who became Patriot Number One in an effort to dissolve corruption in local and provincial government and work for social justice. He married an educated but introverted young woman, spent time in jail, had a son, and became too problematic for the government. Then began the process of leaving the small son with the grandparents, consolidating his funds, borrowing money from family and friends, planning and executing the move from China (without alerting the government), and then coming as just another immigrant to the Chinese community in Flushing, Queens, New York.
Follow along with the tribulations of their living in one small room (which cost as much as a one room apartment in the Midwest), finding trustworthy contacts among the countless strangers, finding employment when unable to understand the language, obtaining political asylum status, working 60 to 70 hours per week, paying taxes and Social Security, and still sending money back to both her parents and his. There are good people and good luck in their lives as well, making this a fascinating but exhausting reading experience. It's also a good insight and reminder to those of us who have parents and grandparents who had similar experiences and also overcame it all.

31146,2708,3901,"Fiona Sheridan is a freelance journalist living in small-town Vermont. Despite being the daughter of a famous journalist, Fiona's career and life have very much on hold since the murder of her older sister 20 years before. Her sister's body was found on the grounds of a defunct girl's boarding school, Idlewild. A man is in prison for the murder, but Fiona still has questions and can't let it go. Even her relationship with Jamie Creel, the police chief, and son of the chief who investigated her sister's murder is hampered by her questions and emotional distance.

Idlewild itself was a second, maybe third-rate school where families placed girls who were considered to be unmanageable. The girls were disciplinary problems; broken in some way by trauma, a little too smart for their own good, or just illegitimate. The Broken Girls switches between the story of four friends in 1950 and Fiona in 2014. One of the four friends went missing, and it was assumed she ran away with ""some boy."" Never mind that the girls had absolutely no unsupervised contact with the outside world.  The records from Idlewild have gone missing, no one associated with the school wants to talk about it, and the school itself is rumored to be haunted. When a body is discovered in a well during a renovation of the property, the missing girl case opens up again. Fiona is determined to get answers this time.

Those of us who have waited a long time for The Broken Girls will not be disappointed. It is intricate, suspenseful, and above all, emotionally involving.  I was utterly caught up in the stories of the four friends; Katie, Roberta, CeCe, and Sonia. I wanted to know what had happened to all of them, and if Fiona's quest would be successful. This blend of Gothic, mystery, suspense and ghost story is not to be missed! Thanks to Berkley and NetGalley for an advance digital copy. The opinions are my own.

31147,3564,3901,"This is one of those books where the setting is just as important and interesting as the main characters. I thought the author did a fantastic job in making Idelwild Hall sound so creepy and spooky and the type of place you wouldn't want to set foot in. I loved how the story switched back and forth between characters and timelines. I thought the mysteries of what happened to the murdered girls was fairly predictable but in no way did it lessen my enjoyment of this book. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a dark atmospheric novel with a bit of mystery.

Fiona Sheridan has been wondering lately if Tim really did kill her sister 20 years ago, and she is determined to find out the truth. She learns that a mysterious woman named Margret Eden has bought the Idlewild School and intends to restore, she decides that she has to write that story as well.

In the 1950s we see story unfolding in the eyes of the girls who were at Idlewild at the time. Roberta, Sonia, Katie and CeCe. We also learn the myth of Mary Hand, and why she scares the girls so much. We also learn that these girls aren't as bad as people think and many have been sent there to cover their own families secrets not their own.

In the present Fiona gets Anthony Eden to give her a tour and talk about the restoration of Idlewild, but she knows that something more is going on at this school that scares everyone. When a body is found in the well, little does Fiona know that in trying to solve that she will finally uncover the mystery surrounding her sister.

I want to say more, but too many details would reveal spoilers and in this story I think it is important to discover link by link on your own. I couldn't stop reading this, I thought it was going to be more centered on the ghost, but little did I know that the ghost would someone tie the two murders together and expose a lot of secrets.

I have to say this though I love the girls from the 1950s and I love Fiona, I was more than a little sad to learn about who was killed in 50s and found in the present day, especially as her story was revealed piece by piece in the past and the future.

31149,112,3901,"Thank you to Berkley Publishing and Netgalley for the chance to read and review this novel.

The Broken Girls is everywhere on social media right now as one of Februarys Book of the Month choices, and definitely seems a worthy pick. This book has been beckoning me since November when I was approved to read it on Netgalley, but I haven't had a chance to fit it in until now. Based on the blurb alone, I knew this would be an interesting story, but it ended up being so much more than I expected.

Torn between four and five stars, I decided to round up because of Simone St. James clever and deep plotting. There are numerous layers to the story, slowly fed to eager readers through the course of the book. The story effortlessly weaves through the past and modern day, interconnecting the two in the most interesting and unexpected ways.

Idlewild Hall shows its smiling, jagged teeth to every girl dropped at its doors. With a past as haunted as that of each of its inhabitants, its only fitting this boarding school is a place for the misfits and discarded girls of 1950. Four girls bond over their murky pasts and current fears, when suddenly one of them goes missing.

In 2014, the spooky Idlewild Hall is purchased to undergo renovations. When Fiona Sheridan, a local journalist, hears of the upcoming project, she decides it is the perfect chance to dig into the history of the eerie place where her own sisters body was found 20 years prior. The circumstances surrounding Fionas sisters murder never sat right with her, and she is determined to uncover the truth.

There is a shift happening in our culture, a huge wave of out with the old, in with the new in terms of mental illness awareness and the acceptance of women as equals in our world. Of course, there are still leaps and bounds to be made, but with modern books like this one and numerous others boasting these topics, it sure feels like our world is quickly changing. As we delve into the past perspectives of the girls at Idlewild Hall in 1950s Vermont, it was easy to see how different life was in regards to both of the topics Ive mentioned. Simon St. James does an exquisite job of capturing the pasts buck up and get on with life attitude through the stories of the forgotten girls at Idlewild Hall. I especially loved the bond between the girls at the boarding school, allowing them to become the family they didn't have. Societys rejects found love and acceptance in each other.

I cant get enough of books with spooky homes or buildings holding long-buried histories, allowing the reader to uncover the pieces while getting a few chills up the spine in the process. I wasn't expecting to be quite as spooked as was, however! This was definitely one I preferred to read in the daytime, but with a story so gripping I wasn't able to put it down at night, staying up well past midnight to figure out the conclusion.

One of my favorite parts of The Broken Girls was learning about real-life Ravensbrck concentration camp in Germany. I have a huge passion for being able to learn through the stories I read, and its all the better when real history meets fiction. I was especially interested to learn about the female Nazi guards at Ravensbrck, as this was something I was completely unaware of. This was a well-researched and interesting read all-around.

31150,563,3901,"I would like to thank Simone St. James, Berkley/Penguin Random House, and NetGalley for allowing me to read an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

Idlewild Hall is a girls boarding school where the illegitimate, the mentally ill, and the troublemakers are swept under the rug. In 1950, four girls band together to survive the cold, dreadful placeand the ghost that uses their darkest secrets against them.

In 2014, Fiona Sheridan still cant stop thinking about her sisters murder. When construction begins on Idlewild, the place where Debs body had been found, Fiona decides to write a piece on the restoration. Shes on the premises, interviewing the landowner, when the crew makes a shocking discovery And soon Fiona finds herself digging up the past to uncover the present.

This is a slight departure from St. James usual tale, mostly in setting. Her novels to date have been set in WWI-era England, gothic ghost stories with plots rooted in the war and a heroine who has to solve a murder mystery with the aid of a traumatized ex-soldier hero. In contrast, The Broken Girls is set in northern Vermont in America, one storyline in 1950, the other in 2014. Theres a ghost story and a murder mystery with roots in WWII that the heroine has to solve. The hero, a cop who I don't believe was ever a soldier, isn't all that helpful.

Youre immediately presented with the mystery in the prologue. I stayed up until three am, unable to take my eyes from the page for more than a minute. For the first two-thirds, I gathered puzzle pieces and tried to keep them organized, frustrated when none of them fit together. Then, precisely when St. James wanted me to, I finally began to put the pieces together and form a clearer picture. I enjoy a narrative that challenges my wits, and I value an author who trusts me to be intelligent enough to understand whats going on without having to stop and explain things to me.

This was much freakier than her last book, Lost Among the Living (though that remains my favorite because Alex is a force of nature.) In LAL, the horror takes a back seatway back, like the third row in an SUVand the characters drive the story. Here, the characters are driving the story, but the creepy horror is right there in the passenger seatstaring *shudders* Now Im imagining being stuck in a car with Mary Hand. Yep, Ill be sleeping with the light on again tonight. I think Ill send St. James my energy bill.

Fiona was a great character, both vulnerable and strong. She had virtues and flawsher determination falling under both categoriesand she was very relatable. She had crappy eating habits, she exercised if she felt like it, and she wasn't any kind of homemaker. I loved that she was bad at the girlfriend thing. Not that she cheated or anything immoral, she just liked to keep things casual and didn't need to be romanced. She wasn't at all needy and seemed reluctant to become attached to anythingor anyone.

If there was one thing I didn't care for, it was Jamie, Fionas boyfriend. He didn't begin to fill Alexs shoes. I found him confusing and somewhat useless. In the first half, I was certain that he loved Fiona and was patiently waiting for her to be ready to become more committed, more involved in each others lives. When he took her face in his hands and kissed her, begging her to come to dinner with his parents, my heart melted. But then she and his father argue, and it didn't seem like Jamie gave her an inch of slack. He got mad at her for not getting along, like she was an incorrigibly discourteous child. I wanted to smack him and scream, You gutless company man! Grow some balls and do the right thing! And after that, there was little that was endearing or heart-melting about him. So I guess he didn't love her, or he wouldnt have driven away.

I didn't like the Idlewild girls as much as I liked Fiona, but then I didn't relate to them as much. Nevertheless, I sympathized with them and was happy when they got the answers theyd spent their entire adult lives looking for. Likewise with Malcolm, Fionas dad.

It got a teensy bit annoying switching back and forth from past to present. I liked Fiona and wanted to stick with her, but the chapters in the past were important, and they were deliberately positioned to provide new information just before you needed to know it. The story was well-structured, in my opinion, and the pace was steady. Oh, and this is funnyin my head I read the book with a British accent. The exposition, the dialogue, all of it. I don't know why; maybe Ive listened to the audio versions of her other books too often, but somehow a British accent seemed to suit her writing. I tried forcing an American one, but it wouldnt stick.

OverallI wish St. James wrote faster.

Scratch that. I won't sacrifice quality for quantity.

Overall, The Broken Girls is a spooky, intelligent, character-driven thriller thatll keep you up at night.

31151,405,3901,"Its rare for me to enjoy a book that blurs the lines between genres, sometimes books that straddle two (or more) genres read kind of messy to me but when I can find an author that manages to blend several genres in a coherent and seamless manner, well, Im thrilled! The Broken Girls was at its core a mystery but it also had historical elements and just enough of the supernatural to be creepy yet plausible.

This is told in dual timelines, you have Fiona in 2014 who is a journalist with painful ties to Idelwild Hall then it also flips back to 1950 when Idelwild Hall was a school for wayward girls and you hear from four friends and roommates. Initially it had a somewhat slower start, but around the halfway point things picked up for me and I was hooked. Fiona and her backstory did reel me in early on but it took me a bit longer to become invested in the four girls, but once I was in, I was all in. Their individual stories were terribly sad and sometimes tragic but their time together at Idelwild Hall was disturbing and at times shocking.

This was an eerily atmospheric read, both narratives are set in Vermont and St. James did an amazing job at creating a hauntingly beautiful setting. The sections in the past were downright scary at times but the more recent chapters were also freaky as the school was long ago abandoned and derelict. Add in a purported ghost named Mary Hand and a handful of cold cases begging to be solved and you have the perfect combination of intrigue and fear. This was a really solid read for me from a talented writer, if you don't mind a small dose of the supernatural in your mysteries then you should check this one out!

31152,2548,3901,"THE BROKEN GIRLS was an amazing mystery filled with secrets. Fiona Sheridan is a freelance journalist living in Vermont. The year is 2014 and she is still haunted by the death of her older sister in 1994. Her sister's boyfriend and local golden boy Tom Christopher was convicted of the murder but Fiona still has questions and spends a lot of time at the site where her sister Deb was found - the playing fields of long-closed boarding school Idlewild which was where troublesome girls were sent.

When Fiona learns that Idlewild Hall was purchased and is going to be restored as a new boarding school, she decides to write a story about it. Idlewild Hall has always had rumors of being haunted and even the local kids were afraid to explore it. When a body is found during the restoration, Fiona becomes even more determined. First, to find out who the girl was and then to learn the secrets buried at Idlewild Hall.

The story is told in two main sections. One section tells the story of four girls who were roommates in 1950 and what happens when one of them goes missing. The girls were throw-aways from their families. Katie was raped at thirteen which embarrassed her family enough to send her away. She is smart, beautiful and a magnet for trouble. Roberta went mute after she saw her Army veteran uncle about to commit suicide. Both situations, Roberta's issues and the uncle's attempted suicide were also embarrassing. CeCe is the illegitimate daughter of a rich powerful man and his housekeeper who was sent to Idlewild Hall after her mother tried to kill her. Sonia is a orphan and a survivor of Ravensbruck Concentration Camp.

The second section takes place in 2014 when Fiona begins her investigation. She's dating the son of the retired police chief but his family is against the relationship. Cops and journalists aren't supposed to be that close. The former police chief is a firm member of the good old boys club that is known for doing favors for friends rather than following the letter of the law.

I really enjoyed this story. I liked the way the two time periods (or three if you count 1994 when Fiona's sister Deb was murdered) were all interwoven. The book was filled with secrets that were gradually revealed. The characters were all engaging. The ghost that haunted Idlewild Hall and showed people their worst moments added a wonderful creepiness to the whole story.

31153,4857,3901,"The Broken Girls was one of the choices for Februarys Book of the Month, with the added bonus of it being an exclusive early release for BOTM subscribers. I always appreciate it when subscription boxes include a book before its released to the general public, and I was really excited after I read the description for The Broken Girls. I immediately added it to my cart and read it right away when it arrived!

First, I would like to point out that this book is not heavily paranormal. Yes, there are paranormal elements, but it is not the main focus. It is spooky and atmospheric, but you will still find it weighs more on the investigative side of a murder case.

The Broken Girls is told in parallel timelines; jumping between the past (1950) and the present (2014). In the past, the chapters alternate between the four teen roommates at Idlewild Hall boarding school: Katie, Cece, Roberta, and Sonia. These girls are the best of friends, and they are considered troublemakers or cast offs. Then, one of them disappears.

Flash forward to 2014, and our main protagonist, journalist Fiona Sheridan, investigates the reconstruction of Idlewild Hall. Fiona tries to find the link between her own sisters murder that happened near Idlewild 20 years ago, to the disappearance of the Idlewild student in 1950.

With that being said, lets talk about the good and the bad:

The Good:

- I liked that we got a glimpse into each of the four roommates at Idlewild. Each girl took on a role, and we learn that the reasons they ended up at the boarding school range from family drama to things much more evil.
- The legend of Mary Hand brought a fun, creepy element to the story. I was worried it would make things cheesy, but it was done very well.
- There are so many mysteries within mysteries within mysteries in this book. The author leaves lots of bread crumbs and clues for you to follow, whether it be in the past or present.
- Fiona is pretty badass. I love that she didn't fall into the unreliable narrator trope, even though in the beginning she acts a little off.
- Actually, all the women are pretty badass!

The Bad (but not really that bad, tbh):

- Fionas sisters murder plot line felt a bit weak and overshadowed by the other mysteries throughout the book. Also, the outcome of that was rather predictable.
- Fionas boyfriend is a cop, and I had to roll my eyes a few times at his behavior. He wasn't a very well written character, and fell into many cop tropes. (He did have some redeeming qualities, so not all hope is lost.)
- There was a lack of chemistry between Fiona and her boyfriend. I think the story would have been great if he wasn't even in the picture, but I understand why it was needed.

This was such a fun page turner that I recommend you read right before bed to get all the spooky feels.

31155,480,3901,"Fiona Sheridan, a journalist, cant get over the murder of her sister twenty years ago. Fiona keeps going back to where her sisters body was found in the middle of an open field at the abandoned Idlewood School. Idlewood was a school where troubled girls were sent, and its rumored to be haunted by Mary, the ghost of a young woman, who died years before the school was founded.

The story encompasses not only Fionas tragedy, but tells the story of four roommates who were at the school sixty years ago. They bonded and became each other's strength until on of them disappeared returning from a weekend to visit family. The school called her a runaway, and her body was never found, but the girls didn't give up their belief that something terrible had happened to her.

The atmosphere at Idlewood is eerie, just right for a ghost. The description of the school, even in its abandoned condition can make chills run up your back.

All the girls in this story are troubled from Fiona to the four roommates. Fiona cant break free from her sisters tragedy until she decides to take action and write about the renovation of the school. The other four are difficult girls, but I couldn't help liking them and rooting for them to become successful women. One, Katie, was particularly resourceful and brave.

31159,390,3902,"I know, I know. Its another story by one of my favourite authors and you probably think the fangirling is going to get mushy. I suspect you are right as this was another great read in this paranormal, action-packed series!

Zara is an expert in the field of artificial intelligence and loves nothing better than sharing her knowledge with the world. If she throws in a bit of corporate espionage that will better that world, then more is the better. When she finds herself in dangerous, no escape situation, she is grateful to her rescuers, especially Gino.  Gratitude changes to more as Gino proves himself to be her everything

Im not just a brain to you. Im a person.

If I make it sound like insta-love then Im definitely giving the wrong impression. The build up of the story is slow and meticulous with stomach-churning tension guaranteed as enemies unleash their brutality. It is gritty and unrelenting, as the forces of good and evil never meet for a garden tea party. Gino and Zara bond during life-threatening situations and their aftermath, allowing time for each to uncover hidden depths and surprises along the way.

He needed someone who would soothe him, quiet the dark demon when it began to emerge.

She wanted him to be real, a terrible demon, and she didn't care if he was sent from heaven or hell.

Zara is a strong heroine but Gino taps into wants and desires she never shows to anyone, hardly admitting them to herself He makes Zara even prouder of her abilities, making her feel safer as she learns how trustworthy and capable he is

You going to give me everything like that, baby? Whenever I ask? Whatever I ask for?

 Trust is a gift, Zara, and I won't forget that you give it to me every day were together.

Ill be re-reading this story often  and soon!

31160,679,3902,"4.25 stars--COVERT GAME  is the fourteenth instalment in Christine Feehans contemporary adult GHOSTWALKERS paranormal, romantic suspense series focusing on an elite group of genetically enhanced men and women known as the GhostWalkers. These super soldiers were once part of an unauthorized government experiment performed by Dr. Peter Whitney-a man tantamount to evil incarnate. This is GhostWalker/hunter Gino Phantom Wind Mazza, and industrial spy/GhostWalker Zara Hightowers story line. COVERT GAME can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Any important information from the previous story lines is revealed where necessary but I recommend reading the series in order for backstory and cohesion.

WARNING: COVERT GAME contains very descriptive scenes of graphic violence and torture that may not be suitable for all readers.

Told from dual third person perspectives (Zara and Gino) COVERT GAME follows the abduction, torture and eventual rescue of enhanced female Zara Hightower. Considered a genius in the world of AI (Artificial Intelligence), Zara was Dr. Whitneys pawn; an industrial spy whose special abilities superseded what the evil doctor considered her glaring failures. Sent to download a file about the GhostWalkers, from Chinese crime lord Mr. Cheng, Zara found herself trapped by a man, Bolan Zhu, whose reputation in specialized torture preceded our heroines visit to Shanghai. What ensues is the rescue and recovery of our Zara Hightower; the building relationship and romance between our leading couple; and the fall-out when several teams of Whitneys enhanced soldiers, and Bolan Zhu, are sent to recapture our story line heroine.

Team Four never expected to honor one of Dr. Whitneys requests but the rescue of Zara Hightower meant the rescue of one of their own. Prepared for anything, Gino Mazza suspected the rescue was a trap, but a trap that found our hero falling in love.

The relationship between Gino and Zara is one of immediate attraction but unlike the earlier GhostWalker story lines there is no proof that the attraction is chemically connected or fated by enhanced DNA. Gino is an alpha male; a dominant man who is quick to protect the woman with whom he is falling in love but a dominance that appears to be genetically matched to our heroines submissive personality. The $ex scenes are intimate, erotic and intense without the use of over the top, sexually graphic language and text.

Most of GhostWalker Team Four  (and their significant others) play secondary and supporting characters: Diego Campo, Draden Freeman, Ezekiel Fortunes, Team leader Joe Spagnola, Malichai and Mordichai Fortunes, Trap Dawkins, Rubin Campo and Wyatt Fontenot, along with Wyatts Nonny Grace Fontenot.

COVERT GAME is a story of power, abuse, betrayal and revenge. As the series continues to develop the author has changed the original direction of the series in that the enhanced soldiers no longer need or require a female to anchor their abilities (Team 1); and the most recent instalment does not confirm or deny the existence of genetically matched DNA between two unsuspecting GhostWalkers, both changes the author addresses in the current story line.

Most of the recent male GhostWalkers volunteered for the genetic enhancements such that to blame the doctor for many of their problems is not necessarily true but Dr. Whitneys ongoing experiments with the female GhostWalkers, many of whom were abducted and tortured at an early age, is still quite prevalent throughout the series.  As well, our heroine appears to have no psychic power, or the ability to communicate psychically with the man that she loves, something that wasn't addressed in this particular story line.

I would also like to point out the author continues to justify Traps abusive behaviour in Spider Game (GhostWalker #12) as a by-product of Aspergers Syndrome a plot point that was never mentioned in Traps story line- Spider Game- but has been addressed in the last two instalments in an effort, I believe, to appease the many negative comments and reviews about Traps abusive and controlling behaviour. In this, there is also much talk between the heroines, throughout Covert Game, rationalizing and accepting their mates controlling behaviour-something I see as the author, once again, as trying to defend her male characters less than favourable characteristics. I do not have a problem with alpha males in my fictional story lines but the increase in controlling and somewhat abusive behaviour is something the author is most likely trying to address and explain via her female leads.

COVERT GAME is a suspenseful and action packed story line. Gino will seek retribution for the woman he loves, retribution that is equal to the torture inflicted upon our story line heroine. The premise is startling, dramatic and intense; the characters are intelligent, complex and charismatic; the romance is intimate and emotional. COVERT GAME is an intriguing and fascinating look at the paranormal.

31165,4210,2065,"So much has been said already about this book that I'm not sure there is a lot left for me to add, but I will try anyway.

Night is probably the best book I have ever read about the Holocaust. I read it once when I was in high school and again quite recently in one sitting. It is a relatively short book with only 115 pages and a large font size, yet it's not a light or breezy read. What it lacks in length, it makes up for in subject matter. Night is a concise, dark, and tragic look at the process of dehumanization that occurred in the Nazi concentration camp network.

As a devout fifteen-year-old Talmud scholar, Eliezer Wiesel is taken from his hometown in Transylvania and shipped along with his family to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where he is separated from his mother and sisters (""Men to the left, women to the right!""). Wiesel notes that this is the last time he would ever see his mother or the youngest of his three sisters, whom he later learns were gassed upon arrival.

After this, the story's main theme is the gradual unraveling of Wiesel's humanity. He is starved, beaten, whipped, and forced to watch hundreds of his own people suffer the same fate before his eyes. He describes the sight of babies thrown into pits of fire, and being unsure as to whether they were already dead or still alive when tossed to burn. Wiesel, as a result of this horrific treatment, begins to become almost animalistic in his need to survive, beginning to secretly and guiltily wish for his father's death so he can focus on his own survival.

The two sub-themes emerging from this are Wiesel's crisis of faith. Having been an extremely devout Jew, he finds himself growing to hate God for allowing this to happen to his people. The second, and in my opinion most moving theme, is his struggle to continue loving his father as he loses his humanity, and this creates the climax and emotional crux of the book.

It's difficult to do such a complex, dense, and moving book justice in a short review. But what makes this Holocaust story so remarkable is that it isn't a recollection of the events of one of humanity's darkest moments; instead, it recounts the experiences of one boy struggling to survive in this hideous, horrible place, and the loss of innocence, faith, love, and humanity that endures from such brutal, horrifying abuse. This is one of those books that everyone should read at some point. Its subject matter and simplicity of prose certainly merit such a title.",1521504000,5,much said alreadi book im sure lot left add tri anyway night probabl best book ever read holocaust read high school quit recent one sit rel short book 115 page larg font size yet light breezi read lack length make subject matter night concis dark tragic look process dehuman occur nazi concentr camp network devout fifteenyearold talmud scholar eliez wiesel taken hometown transylvania ship along famili auschwitzbirkenau separ mother sister men left woman right wiesel note last time would ever see mother youngest three sister later learn gas upon arriv stori main theme gradual unravel wiesel human starv beaten whip forc watch hundr peopl suffer fate eye describ sight babi thrown pit fire unsur whether alreadi dead still aliv toss burn wiesel result horrif treatment begin becom almost animalist need surviv begin secretli guiltili wish father death focu surviv two subthem emerg wiesel crisi faith extrem devout jew find

31168,4015,1675,"This book offers an excellent assessment and interpretation of the events leading up to and during World War II at the grand strategic level. There is little, if any, original research in the book. In looking at the bibliography and the citations of the chapters, I would say that the author (Victor Hanson) has probably read every significant book published on World War II in English over the past 30 years.

 In my opinion, the books author is better at assessing major events and their significance than in discussing details of tanks and artillery. He makes many errors regarding weapon armament and development.

For example, in Chapter 7 Ships and Strategies, he states Had Germany and Italy finished a carrier  for example, a Graf Zeppelin-class carrier carrying twelve or so modified Bf 109s and perhaps 30 adapted Ju 87 Stukasthey would have had a far better chance of winning the battles of the Atlantic and Mediterranean. This is, unfortunately, a naive assessment that you frequently read in fantasy alternative histories of WW II. The navies that had aircraft carriers-- such as the US, Britain and Japan-- developed ships, pilots, aircrew, aircraft and doctrine over a period of 20 years from around 1918 through 1939. Germany and Italy weren't going to match this in just three or four years. They also weren't going to match the British Navy with just one or two small aircraft carriers deployed to the North Atlantic.

In Chapter 7, the author also invents a US battleship that didn't exist in WW II: the North Dakota. There was a US battleship South Dakota, but no North Dakota.

Another questionable assessment also in Chapter 7: the author states that submarines could be built far more cheaply than battleships and cruisers. This is true, but a WW II submarine cost as much as a destroyer. In addition, submarine attacks by any of the navies in WW II only succeeded against other navies that couldnt, or were unable, to provide adequate anti-submarine escorts for their merchant cargo ships.

Another questionable assessment in Chapter 7: By 1939, the promise of improved submarines seemed to guarantee greater success in World War II, given superior ranges, speeds, depths, and armament., This is completely wrong: the technical performance of submarines in 1939 wasn't much better than that of 1918. The German Type XXI U-boats of 1944 / 1945 eventually revolutionized submarine performance after WW II, but that certainly wasn't the case of submarines during most of WW II.

Chapter 15 Tanks and Artillery offers further examples of the authors technological weaknesses. In several places he states that the German Panzer IV was initially armed with a 50 mm gun. This incorrect: the Panzer IV was initially armed with a 75 mm L/24. It was never armed with a 50 mm gun. It was progressively upgraded with a 75 mm L/43 and then a 75 mm L/48. Another distortion or exaggeration occurs on pages 373:  the classical German 75 mm tank gun (mostly known as the 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70)with a longer barrel could easily penetrate thick armor at long distances in a way that the Shermans 75 could not. The statement on armor penetration is correct, but the claim that this gun was the classic German anti-tank weapon is wrong. The 7.5 cm L/70 was only used to arm the Panther tank and the Jagdpanzer IV self-propelled anti-tank vehicle. Far more towed 75 mm L/46 and vehicle-armed L/48 guns were manufactured and deployed than the 75 mm L/70.

Other errors occur at the end of Chapter 15. The caption for the first photo states By 1941 Krupp was building the famous 88 mm cannon in plants expropriated throughout occupied Europe.  Here a French factory turns out anti-aircraft models of the famous gun. The photo shows a German 50 mm anti-tank gun, not an 88 mm anti-aircraft gun. The French caption within the photo reads Construction de cannons antichars which translates as Construction of anti-tank guns.

The second photo at the end of Chapter 15 is of a German railway gun. The caption reads: Despite their dramatic appearance, Germanys huge K-5 rail runs never justified the time, manpower, and expense involved in their deployment. The battery pictured here was integrated into the Atlantic Wall defenses in France by 1944. Whatever gun this is, it is not a K-5. I am not an expert on German railway artillery, but I have compared this photo with those shown in several books I have on German railway artillery. The 280 mm L/76 K-5 had a barrel almost 70 feet long. In comparing the barrel length to the breach in this photo, it is clearly not that of a K-5. I think there are at least three possibilities of what this gun really is: 1) a 28 cm Schwere Bruno, 2) a 24 cm Theodor Bruno, 3) a captured 274 mm French gun. I think this latter gun is a real possibility: the Germans mounted hundreds of captured French guns in the Atlantic Wall, if only to take advantage of the large amounts of captured French ammunition to go with them.

I thought the best chapters were Chapter 18 The Workers, Chapter 19 The Dead, and Chapter 20 Why and What Did the Allies Win? The chapters really don't offer anything new in the way of data or information, but they offer excellent summaries of production, mass deaths, and how victory or defeat was achieved. I never cease to be amazed at how cruel and murderous human beings can be with each other. World War II resulted in 60 to 80 million deaths, or around 4% of the world population of the time. At least  of them were civilians. They were starved, shot, gassed, and bombed because they were of the wrong race, wrong religion, wrong ethnic group, or just in the wrong place at the wrong time. At least so-called lower animals kill for important things like food and sex.",1521504000,4,book offer excel ass interpret event lead world war ii grand strateg level littl origin research book look bibliographi citat chapter would say author victor hanson probabl read everi signific book publish world war ii english past 30 year opinion book author better ass major event signific discus detail tank artilleri make mani error regard weapon armament develop exampl chapter 7 ship strategi state germani itali finish carrier exampl graf zeppelinclass carrier carri twelv modifi bf 109 perhap 30 adapt ju 87 stukasthey would far better chanc win battl atlant mediterranean unfortun naiv ass frequent read fantasi altern histori ww ii navi aircraft carrier u britain japan develop ship pilot aircrew aircraft doctrin period 20 year around 1918 1939 germani itali werent go match three four year also werent go match british navi one two small aircraft carrier deploy north atlant chapter 7 author also invent u battleship didnt exist ww ii north dakota u battleship south dakota north dakota anoth question ass also chapter 7 author state submarin could built far cheapli battleship cruiser true ww ii submarin

31171,2435,3870,"I am a child of Southern California and the wildfires that consume everything were such a huge part of my life growing up. There were plenty of times that we received notices to be prepared to evacuate, school closed due to poor air quality, and people walking around with face masks as ash rained down. When I saw that this book was about a California fire, I was interested to see how the book would play out. And oh my geez, this was not at all what I expected this book to be when I started, and I really mean that in the best way possible. The author nailed the setting perfectly, the story was able to bring to life the fire, the desperation, the loss. This was such a crazy, emotional ride and where I started with these characters is not how we ended. This is very much a character driven story, where almost no action happens, but really it was introspective as to how the characters developed, what pushed them into certain situations, and what kind of outcome do they have left to them.

I feel like I know Audrey, every damaged, hurt part of of her. And when I say damaged, I am being serious. This girl is an emotional mess, but at the same time I could 100% relate to her, empathize with her, and I understood how she got to be in this place. I don't blame her for her feelings, she was lost and thought she had been found, but instead she found herself in a dangerous, passionate, world full of lies she could not see through. I rooted for her at the end of the book, so happy at the revelations she admitted to as well as the truths she fought for. And her love towards her sister and best friend were amazing, showing all the kinds of relationships a person needs to be healthy.

I loved the format of the book, with lots of short chapters, ranging from just a paragraph to four or five pages. If you want to hook me on a story this is the best way to do it- I always think just one more and next thing I know I am a 100 pages further and it's an hour later. I love this writing format, to me it makes a book more approachable and easy to escape into, be it briefly or for hours.

Also, the story takes place over 24 hours, but the current actions are alternated with the memories that Audrey has had over the past few months pertaining to her relationship with Brooks, filling in the dynamic between their relationship status and how we all got this point.

This is the authors debut book and I could not be more impressed with the crazy ride that I was taken on. I sped through the pages and was shocked by the twists provided. This is not rainbows and sunshine, but hurt, depression and all the feels. I highly recommend this read for anyone looking for an emotional, realistic YA read to get sucked into.

31174,3921,3901,"In a remote area of Vermont, outside the small town of Barrons, a girl, suitcase in hand, runs through the isolated, gloomy forest. She is running from someone or something. As the chapter continued, I could hear a Hitchcockesque soundtrack playing in my head. The prologue of The Broken Girls hooked me. I spent the rest of the book wondering who or what the girl was really running from, and worrying about the terrifying apparition.

Author Simone St. James latest novel is excellent.  It is part ghost story and part mystery.  Ms. St. James tells her tale in dual time periods as well as from multiple perspectives.  There are a few story threads being woven together in The Broken Girls.  One story is of the disappearance of Sonia, a student at Idlewild Hall in 1950. Another story is of the aftermath of the 1994 murder of Deb Sheridan, whose body was found at Idlewild long after the school had been closed.  Lastly, there is the present-day story of Debs sister, Fiona, who is still haunted by her death.

From the first page to the last, this book was absolutely chilling!  The constant sense of dread and foreboding had me on the edge of my seat.  Ms. St. James historical research of events influencing a main character/storyline is apparent, and the resulting realism creates an eeriness to her tale.  The book features the girls who roomed in Clayton 3C at Idlewild Hall.  Sonia, CeCe, Roberta and Katies individual histories, which has landed them in the God-forsaken school, is tragic and heartbreaking.  The authors depiction of modern-day Fiona Sheridan, a journalist, is equally heart wrenching.  The ghost of Mary Hand, whose death was no less tragic than these girls existence, traumatizes each of the girls.  Whether the story of Idlewilds Ghost, the students of the school, or Fiona, the girls were troubled by something and silenced by a situation or a person.  Fiona is so broken by her sisters death that she cant form solid love relationships and she cant find the motivation to propel her career forward.

Fionas relationship with local policeman, Jamie Creel, seemed to almost be a convenient afterthought in the story.  At first their romance seems a bit serendipitous, but as the story progresses, I seriously questioned Jamies motives.  This relatively casual relationship becomes the catalyst that catapults The Broken Girls from mournful ghost story to paging-turning mystery. Even further in the story I was longing for Jamie and Fionas relationship to be a predestined dramatic love story despite how history and life in a small town was dragging them down like a pair of cement shoes.

As the story tension rises to a crescendo that could only be likened to a banshees cry, all the troubled girls in this story are forced to reckon with their own ghosts and become stronger for it.  If this isn't a story featuring girl power, I don't know what would be considered one.

31176,84,1233,"I Am, I Am, I Am is a memoir by author Maggie O'Farrell about her seventeen brushes with death.  I found the writing style to be off-putting, as some sentences were overly-flourished and others were choppy or abrupt.  Dramatized and exaggerated, the moments where Maggie felt her life could be in danger were blown way out of proportion most of the time.  The ""woe is me"" attitude was grating and I never felt a connection with the author as a result.

Both the tribe and the old women end up learning a lot about their limits and what is important to them as a result of this abandonment.  It was a quick read and a good story.  I found myself surprisingly sucked into the tale.  I enjoyed the survival elements and hearing about people of that time and how they survived in such harsh conditions.

The writing style is very stark and simple (normally not my favorite style of writing to read) but it matched the style of the tale well.

31191,617,2000,"This is my fourth read of the Night Huntress series, and I couldn't believe that I haven't reviewed them on the blog before. Probably because once I get going on this series, I tend to binge the books one after another and get carried away before I manage to put pen to paper for a review. So why am I reading them again this time? Well I was recently recommending the series to a friend and it put the bug in my brain that I was missing me some Cat and Bones... and I just had to get back to my favorite English vampire and his fiery assassin.

Catherine Kathleen Crawfield (a/k/a Cat) is a half-breed vampire and human who has been raised to think that all vampires are evil demons that need killing. Cat's mother is a real piece of work who has relayed a tragic story to Cat to convince her of this ""fact"" and has encouraged Cat to go on the hunt since she was a teenager. Even though Cat is now in her early 20s, she is still a somewhat naive girl, which is at odds with her nocturnal activity. But throughout this story (and the series as a whole), Cat becomes a true kickass heroine. She remains one of my favorite romance heroines to this day.

But as much as I like Cat, I adore our hero that much more. Crispin ""Bones"" Russell is a 200+ year old vampire, originally from England, but ""made"" in New South Wales. He is funny, possessive, sexy and powerful. He is also one of my favorite romance heroes. Some of the one-liners and teasing that he doles out to our heroine is hilarious, and I just live to hear his ""Hallo, Kitten.""

This first book sees Cat and Bones teaming up, and Cat gets an education about vampires that she was sorely lacking. The romance between them unfolds slowly as the book progresses, and things don't get too steamy (yet). Halfway to the Grave really lays the foundation for the series and lets you establish that connection with both Cat and Bones, and start getting to know some of the secondary characters. We learn about vampires along with Cat and see her grow as a person, and start to accept her dual nature.

Even though this is my fourth time reading the book, it was just as good as the first time. I'm moving forward with a binge of the series so stay tuned for more reviews.",1521590400,4,fourth read night huntress seri couldnt believ havent review blog probabl get go seri tend bing book one anoth get carri away manag put pen paper review read time well recent recommend seri friend put bug brain miss cat bone get back favorit english vampir fieri assassin catherin kathleen crawfield aka cat halfbre vampir human rais think vampir evil demon need kill cat mother real piec work relay tragic stori cat convinc fact encourag cat go hunt sinc teenag even though cat earli 20 still somewhat naiv girl odd nocturn activ throughout stori seri whole cat becom true kickass heroin remain one favorit romanc heroin day much like cat ador hero much crispin bone russel 200 year old vampir origin england made new south wale funni posse sexi power also one favorit romanc hero onelin tea dole heroin hilari live hear hallo kitten first book see cat bone

31194,412,3860,"How do you know where you're going when youve never seen your story told before? What are you running from, what are you running towards, and what parts of yourself do you leave behind when you take off? Uzodinma Iwealas slender novel, SPEAK NO EVIL, speaks volumes, and reverberates with hard truths about the intersections of race, gender, institutionalized violence and sexuality.

In contemporary D.C., two 18-year-olds navigate these intersections. Niru and Meredith have been best friends for a long time. On the surface, their lives overlap --- the success of their respective parents buys them certain class privileges and affords them the raised expectations of Ivy League-bound youths, full of promise. But when Meredith seeks to turn their friendship into something more, Nirus long-buried truth crashes to the surface. He is gay, which isn't a big deal to Meredith and her left-leaning East Coast white sensibilities, but is absolutely devastating to Nirus conservative Nigerian immigrant parents. Their discovery of his secret is inextricably entangled in his friendship with Meredith, and that fact haunts both teens for the rest of their lives.

Nirus parents bring him to Nigeria for conversion therapy. He finds some solace in his parents hometown, but also predominantly further isolation. How much easier it would be for him and his family if conversion therapy worked. But, of course, it doesnt. Niru wants to cut his sexuality away cleanly, to be the son his parents want, but he cant --- all the more so when he returns home and meets a handsome dancer named Damien.

This is not a straightforward novel or a happy one. Niru tells his own story for the first half of the book, which culminates in an act of violence, desperation and all-too-familiar misunderstanding. Meredith picks up the pieces and narrates the second half, looking back on it six years later. Iweala understands all too well how books are often split into singular issues --- race, class, gender, violence --- and weaves together many of these threads into a savagely realistic story.

I came away from SPEAK NO EVIL galvanized and outraged, but also devastated. Iweala was widely celebrated for his first book, BEASTS OF NO NATION. Expect a narrower focus here, but a no-less wrenching takeaway and consistently luminous prose. His deft writing propels the narrative forward. At times, I did want more --- I wanted more understanding of how Niru kept this truth from himself for so long, and what it felt to experience it, however briefly, with Damien. And yet, Iwealas voice kept me deeply invested in his project, and I do feel that the moments he left me yearning were carefully and brutally chosen, refusing to give me more than Niru was able to receive.

I love both Nirus and Merediths voices. I could feel her helplessness, desire and well-meaning. I could feel his agony, desperation, and need to run and to keep running. This is a prescient, urgent awakening of a read. Go in with an open heart, but prepare for it to shatter. Be ready to carry Niru and Meredith with you for a long time.

31196,4977,2799,"Im going to start this review off with a little quote from my mom. It will kind of give yall an idea of what I was expecting to feel going into reading this book. it gave me nightmares and I threw it in a dumpster because it was evil. I couldn't sleep without the lights on for years after I won't even watch the movie now Now to the NYT quote, There are not many readers who will be unmoved NYT Book Review. Maybe my expectations were too high? It wasn't a bad novel, obviously, I still gave it 4 stars. It just wasn't what I was expecting after all of the reviews and the hype.

I was severely disappointed. Yes, its scary, but it doesnt get creepy until page 100 and then again until 200. I was really let down by this novel. REALLY LET DOWN. I don't get all the hype. My mom said its because I don't truly believe that something like that could happen. If I did then I wouldve been utterly terrified like everyone else.

Karras irritates me, along with Kinderman. The conversations felt forced and unrealistic. What doin? Oh god why. Why. WHAT ARE YOU DOING. Not, What doin? I read something that said this book was a draft that got published when the author went into directing? Dont know how true this is because I couldn't find the quote to link here, but it would make sense.

One thing to take away from this book, DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT play with a Ouija board. Dont do it. I never have and I never will. I don't want a Captain Howdy possessing me. Im good yall. I think playing with those boards opens a door. Maybe it didn't scare me as bad as it did others because thats how I feel they get in. I don't know.

Yall, I feel for Regan. I mean, whose mom just leaves a Ouija board laying around in the first place, but Jesus. This poor girl. She just bounces back in the epilogue like nothing ever happened. After what we read about her body changing, I don't see how it just went back to normal after the demon left. I mean, you know home girls got some major back and neck pains. I did think something was going to happen with Sharon after them saying to watch out for her? And then nothing happened.

31197,3455,3508,"What would you do if a vacation taken with friends to the French countryside resulted in you being the prime suspect in a murder investigation ten years later? This is a reality for the storys narrator, Kate Channing, and her four surviving friends. After struggling to make ends meet with her new business, things begin to take a better turn for Kate. That is, until skeletal remains are found at the bottom of a well reopening a decade old investigation into the death of Mademoiselle Severine, causing stress and turmoil in Kates business and personal relationships.

After reading the blurb I was addicted to the premise of this book, but unfortunately, once I dived in, everything fell a bit flat for me. Despite the low page count, I found myself taking significantly longer to finish this read. With its slow pace, I was often putting this down and taking much longer to pick it back up. It took a while for this story to completely grasp my attention, and by a while I mean I was roughly 90% in before I really started turning the pages. Not to say there weren't other times throughout this story where my interest peaked, but there were far too many where my attention fell short.

In addition to the pace being very slow, I never felt a connection to any of the characters or to their story. I was rather disinterested in their growth or their developing relationships. I did however enjoy the message that Lexie Elliott was trying to convey in the development of these characters. There are quite a few characters in this story, including the ghosts of a dead girl; although Im unsure if the mirage of Severine was paranormal or psychological. I suppose this is up to the readers interpretation. I found this inclusion to be a bit irritating at first, but the ghost of the French girl began to grow on me overtime.

Due to Kate seeing the ghost of Severine, I initially felt Lexie was leading the reader to believe Kate had something to do with her death, but how could it be that obvious early on, right? As I continued, it began to feel obvious who was to blame for Severines disappearance a decade prior. Ultimately, the ending proved my suspicion to be true. With the glacier pace this story had taken to reach this result, I was really hoping for a bang ending. But that did not happen here. While the ending wasn't displeasing, it felt like the story just fizzled out.

I primarily enjoy mysteries with thrilling twists that take me by surprise. This was expected but was not delivered, leaving me feeling unfulfilled. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys slow paced cozy mysteries, with a hint of paranormal and romance. All issues aside, I did enjoy Lexies writing enough to consider another try with her next title.

COVER THOUGHTS:Does anyone else also analyze the cover/jacket of books? The jacket on this novel is very thought provoking. I can only assume the girl found on the cover to be Severine. We also have a female shadow on the diving board, which fits the outline of the girl on the cover. However, upon further investigation, there is no one standing on the diving board when you peer at the back cover. Spooky!

Many thanks to Lexie Elliott and Berkley Books for an advanced readers copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.

Vicki DeVine and her shapeshifter lodger, Aggie Crowe, stumble upon a dead body and find themselves tangled up in dangerously dark secrets. After her divorce, Vicki took over a rustic resort near Lake Silence, in a human town that isn't controlled by humans but by the Others. Human law doesnt apply in regions controlled by the Others-vampires, shapeshifters, and paranormal beings even more deadly. And, this is something that no human should be foolish enough to forget. Towns like Vickis have no distance between them and the Others, The dominant predators that rule most of the land and all of the water. And with no boundaries, theres no way of knowing just who or what is watching you. All Vicki wanted to do was start over and find a way to support herself. After Aggie finds a dead body, it starts to look like her new life might be over before it really begins because the human detectives seem determined to ignore the evidence that nothing human killed the man and pin the murder on her. It definitely appears that someone wants Vicki out of the way and they may be willing to kill to do it.

This story is still set in the world of Anne Bishops Others Series but, this time, in a different part of Thasia. At first, I wondered if Id miss my favorite characters from the first five books, but it didn't take long for me to fall in love with the characters in Sproing. Id still be ok with it if they had certain visitors from the Lakeside Courtyard. I really enjoyed the Crowguard taking a bigger role in this book, as theyve always been among my favorite of the shifters. Im also glad that there were ponies in this region, as well, because I adore the ponies! I guess I should have expected that there would be since there were elemental. I also love that the elemental are more present. Lets just be honest and admit that Anne Bishop has an amazing talent at character development and character creation. For she truly had to put a lot of thought into the Shapeshifters and Elementals, as well as the Elders. Most authors stop with the basic werewolf when it comes to Shapeshifters, but Bishop has incorporated most animals as forms that the Terra Indigene may have chosen when they began shifting shapes. The Sproingers are such an amazing addition! And they were described well enough that I can picture them in my head and I *think* I know what animal they're based on. Seriously, they have to be well written for me to find myself pulling against my own species... I found myself thinking stupid humans! a number of times in this book and the previous books in the series. Like the rest of the series, theres enough action to keep the storyline moving while expertly blending chances to really get to know the characters. I loved the description of the Elders in the lake and that they have a different form from those on land (I assume as we still haven't actually seen the ones on land, just their actions). I dearly hope that Bishop continues to write and explore this universe. My only request would be to learn more about Julians backstory in subsequent books. A lot was hinted at but just enough to get me intrigued. Now, I just need to figure out how Ill make it until the next book comes out!!

From a chance meeting with May Crandall at a nursing home, hints of a connection to Avery's grandmother begin to surface. As the story unfolds, and Avery discover's her grandmother's secrets, Avery also discovers a few things about herself in the process.

31205,72,2654,"First off, this book is a bit of a departure from Roberts normal fare of writing.  In a way, this is her version of The Stand with magical abilities thrown in for spice.  A prophecy predicted the events that were to unfold.  An American couple holidaying in Scotland with family kill a pheasant spilling blood on the sacred ground. He gets sick and passes it on to the family and everyone he comes into contact with at the airport.  Within seventy-two hours he is dead in the hospital.  Pretty soon a pandemic in underway and within three weeks two billion people are dead from what they are calling the Doom.

Some are naturally immune and some develop magical abilities such as being faeries, elves, or witches, or the ability to see into the future, telekinesis, or know whether someone is going to live or die.  Like people, though, those with magical abilities come in light and dark.  Lana and Max were witches with a small bit of power before the big event but now their powers are greatly heightened. Max is a writer and Lana is a top-notch chef.  Things in New York City are getting dangerous with the band of Raiders on motorcycles attacking and killing those they call Uncanny who have magical powers so they decide to head to the Pennsylvania mountains to where his brother Eric is holed up.  On the way, they pick up a young man named Eddie and his dog Joe.  When they arrive they discover a summer cabin with Eric's girlfriend Allegra, a girl named Kim, a guy named Poe, and the owner of the house, Shaun.  All of them are people from Eric's college.  But life is not all sunshine and roses at the cabin.  Eric has abilities he does not know how to control and he and Allegra are not doing their share around the cabin causing some resentments.  Also, they know they can't stay there forever. They must move on and find a community to join that has a farm and animals, where there is safety in numbers.

Aryls Reed has moved up in the media world to anchor chair in New York City since everyone else has either died or fled.  She has a secret source, Chuck, a hacker who gives her the real scoop but she keeps most of it to herself because to do otherwise would cause a panic and the government to come and shut them down.  They have a plan to meet in Hoboken, New Jersey whenever she decides to reveal everything and hightail it out of the city.  When she does, including that the government is rounding up people who are immune, magical and nonmagical alike to experiment on them, her and the young cheery woman Fred, a faerie, head out and meet Chuck.

At the hospital in New York City, Jonah knows when people are going to die so he's been feeling pretty depressed as he's a paramedic and everyone he brings in is a goner.  But the woman he has a crush on, Dr. Rachel Hobson remains a beacon of hope for him. But when she gives up he decides to end his life. Before he can, he runs into Katie, the daughter of the original carrier of the Doom who is pregnant with twins and is in labor.  The only OBGYN doctor is busy doing a C-section on another woman and he is trying to reach Rachel, but the babies are coming now, so he ends up delivering them himself.  Jonah and Katie talk Rachael into going with them out of New York and taking the now dead woman's baby girl.  They stock up and head out and wind up in Hoboken where they meet Aryls and her gang.

Lana and Max and their group will meet up with the other group too eventually.  Like The Stand this book is also about a battle of good versus evil, only in this case, the evil side proclaims to have God on its side.  You get a sense of what the United States and the world are like at the very end of the book.  The ending will leave you half content to wait and half desperate for answers that can't wait.  I really tore through this book. It is easily the best book she has written to date.

31206,3441,3840,"I really enjoy the Alpha & Omega / Mercy Thompson universe, and this book was no exception to that. I love the characters and the stories. It's all great. I don't know if I have anything else that's good to say that I haven't said in all the other books she's written. Overall, really entertaining and a good read.

I will say that the first half of it dragged just a touch. Because most of the story is reactionary, it feels like there's a lot of drawn-out scenes that don't really serve a purpose, but I love the characters enough that I enjoyed it. The second half made up for it, but it isn't my favorite of this series. Still really great book and way, way, way better than the last one of the series, but not as good as some of the others.

I will say one small thing that kind of bugs me is that there are times where I swear the author never bothers to fact check her own book. It happens from time to time where she'll basically go back on something she's written before but it happened a little more often than normal in this book.

31210,679,3904,"4.25 stars-- FAST BURN is the fourth (and final?) instalment in Lori Fosters contemporary, adult BODY ARMOR romantic, suspense series focusing on the men and women who work for Body Armor Security. This is MMA fighter Brand Berry, and Body Armor manager Sahara Silvers story line.  FAST BURN can be read as a stand alone without any difficulty. Any important information from the previous story lines is revealed where necessary.

Told from several third person perspectives including Brand and Sahara FAST BURN follows the building relationship between MMA fighter Brand Berry, and Body Armor owner and boss Sahara Silver. Since the disappearance and presumed death of her brother Scott, Sahara Silver has taken over the hiring and management of Body Armor Security. Hoping to lure Brand Berry as a potential member of her security team Sahara battles between her head and her heart as her attraction to the MMA fighter begins to interfere in their professional relationship. When several threats against our heroines life implicate more problems for her missing brother Brand Berry steps in as Saharas personal bodyguard-both in and out of the office. What ensues is the building romance and relationship between Brand and Sahara, and the potential fall-out as her brothers past is seeking revenge, using Sahara as a pawn in a twisted game of vengeance and power.

Brand Berrys attraction to Sahara is tempered by her take-charge attitude, an attitude our hero knows very well. An alpha to the core Brand struggles with Saharas power and authority fearing falling in love with a woman who has the potential to emasculate our hero both in and out of the bedroom. Sahara is a strong-willed heroine who is not afraid to tell it like it is. Falling for Brand Berry meant occasionally stepping back and letting the man with whom she is falling in love, take charge in order to protect her life. The $ex scenes are intimate, erotic and intense.

There is a large ensemble cast of familiar secondary and supporting characters including all of the previous story line couples: Leese and Catalina (Under Pressure #1), Justice and Fallon (Hard Justice #2), Miles and Maxi (Close Contact #3), and Saharas PA Enoch. We are introduced to Brands parents John and Ann, as well as Brands birth mother Becky. The requisite evil has several faces, many connected to Saharas brothers past.

The world building continues to focus on  protection, suspense, romance and love. The MMA aspect is negligible with only a couple of mentions about potential fights, in the future.

FAST BURN is a fast paced, energetic and suspense filled story of revenge, power, secrets and lies. The premise is spirited, powerful and driving; the characters are rugged, determined and colorful; the romance is seductive and passionate. FAST BURN is an electrifying and dramatic story about two people pulled together by circumstance, attraction and love.",1521590400,4,425 star fast burn fourth final instal lori foster contemporari adult bodi armor romant suspens seri focus men woman work bodi armor secur mma fighter brand berri bodi armor manag sahara silver stori line fast burn read stand alon without difficulti import inform previou stori line reveal necessari told sever third person perspect includ brand sahara fast burn follow build relationship mma fighter brand berri bodi armor owner bos sahara silver sinc disappear presum death brother scott sahara silver taken hire manag bodi armor secur hope lure brand berri potenti member secur team sahara battl head heart attract mma fighter begin interfer profession relationship sever threat heroin life implic problem miss brother brand berri step sahara person bodyguardboth offic ensu build romanc relationship brand sahara potenti fallout brother past seek reveng use sahara pawn twist game vengeanc power brand berri attract sahara temper takecharg attitud attitud hero know well alpha core brand struggl sahara power author fear fall love woman potenti emascul hero bedroom sahara strongwil heroin afraid tell like fall brand berri meant occasion step back let man
31211,749,3904,"Fast Burn is fourth in Lori Fosters Body Armor series, but don't worry if you haven't read the rest. This one stands perfectly well alone.

Sahara Silver is the female CEO of Body Armor, an elite bodyguarding agency. Recruiting highly-skilled MMA fighters, shes turned her business into the go-to agency for celebrities in the spotlight. Keen to add Brand Berry to her stable of former MMA employees, hes the one man who seems impervious to her wiles. Or rather, not in the least interested in working for her only in her, personally.

When trouble comes for Sahara, Brands the one who is there for her, even more than her loyal employees. Building a relationship in the midst of disaster isn't optimum conditions, but it can certainly make for a strong bond, and thats what happens for this pair.

While (slight spoilers) Sahara gets kidnapped and into sticky situations several times, shes definitely not a wilting female. Quite the opposite, and though on several situations shes outmanned and outgunned, her plucky determination and resourcefulness had me rooting for her all along.

Unfortunately, Brand got a bit caveman at times for my taste. He and Sahara came to an agreement early on that she would be the boss when it came to work situations and he would be in charge at other times, which would be perfectly fine - except that he constantly argued with and tried to overrule her in situations where she was clearly more experienced than he was. All for her own good, of course.

Being an alpha male is one thing. Being an alpha a-hole is something else, and Im afraid Brand tipped over the line into the latter for me. So even though I loved Sahara and this was well-written and edited, I really cant give it any more than three stars.

31212,1812,3904,"This is the latest romantic suspense novel in the Body Armor Series by Ms. Foster. It can be read as a stand alone, as can the others in the series, but they're such great reads I would recommend them all.

Sahara Silver is the owner and operator of Body Armor, inherited from her brother Scott. He mysteriously disappeared, and is believed dead after a boating accident, leaving the security company to her. She has staffed it with her own operatives, big, sexy, extremely tough and intelligent former MMA fighters. She has been trying relentlessly to get one more fighter on board, Brand Berry who is a close friend of her men. So far he has refused all her pleas, not sure he wants to give up fighting. But he also has a different reason, he is very attracted to Sahara, and mixing business and pleasure never ends well.

Sahara has never believed Scott was dead, even hiring a PI to keep up the hunt. Suddenly she is front and center of a kidnappers grip, and a series of dangerous near misses have Brand and the other Body Armor men anxious to protect her. Sahara, being strong, independent, and assuring them she can protect herself has them all grinding their teeth. Brand takes over her protection, and if he has his way, her heart.

This novel is suspenseful, very sexy and I couldn't put it down once I started.  I always enjoy Lori Fosters stories.

I was pulled right into this story. The story has laughs, secrets, suspense, kidnapping, steam, and heartbreak.

If you have not read the below I would recommend reading them first:
Under Pressure (Body Armor, #1)
Hard Justice (Body Armor #2)
Close Contact (Body Armor #3)

This is Sahara and Brand's story. The chemistry between Brand and Sahara is explosive but Brand is fighting it with everything he has. He knows she wants him, but she also wants him to work for her. She has put the business first no matter what. She lost her brother and it is really all she has now. He is not a man that will be put second. She spends her time running the business and searching for clues to what exactly happened to her brother. When she is kidnapped for her efforts she knows she is in trouble. Brand is furious when she is kidnapped and steps up right away to help find her and bring her back. She needs him, and he will do anything to get her back. This is not the time to be getting personal, but can they fight against it? The danger that surrounds them does not want to let them go. Can he protect and get her out or are they about to both be lost?

This story also pulled in some of the men from the Ultimate Series. Always nice to get a few updates on some characters we love and miss. I loved these characters and the side characters. I felt I could connect with the characters and the story was a great read.

31217,2391,1907,"Flavia is probably my favorite teenager.  I love reading about all of her exploits and this books was not exception. But as a single older lady, I don't have to deal with them.  That is best left to Dogger. In this book Flavia is enjoying the summer, spending her days punting along the river with her reluctant family. Languishing in boredom, she drags a slack hand in the water, and catches her fingers in the open mouth of a drowned corpse. Brought to shore, the dead man is found to be dressed in blue silk with ribbons at the knee, and wearing a single red ballet slipper. And of course, Flavia must solve the mystery of his death.

I find the Flavia well written and entertaining. One or two have been a little draggy but not this one.  The keenly hold my interest. I often wonder how the author comes up with all of the ideas in the book including those about chemistry. And then weaving the music in also.  And I liked the ending which told me there had to be more Flavia books in the future.

I also like that the author is trying new settings and introducing new characters to give the books flavor.  But I missed some of the ones from previous books this time. I especially like her relationship with the Inspector. On the other hand, I see the need to introduce someone who Flavia does not immediately get along with.

31220,2887,667,"There is much more to it than the story of a mother and the son she left. Different from all the other recent releases I've read, THE NIX is terrific. I may be easily impressed after the run of mediocrity I've read recently. We'll see how I feel in a year or so, but I think I will remember this book if only for the massive scope and hilarity. I found myself telling a cashier at the local convenience store about a chapter I found priceless (chapter four.) She did not share my glee. I had no idea chapter four would serve only as an amuse-bouche for the rest of this amazing novel.

Our main character is Samuel Andresen-Anderson and he's very closely linked to his mother Faye, who left him when he was eleven. Through the story of Samuel, we learn the story of his mother and the many characters and events which populate their lives over several decades. We do move around in time, but we only move when it makes sense to do so. As such, there are cliffhangers within the novel and many individual narratives that feed and develop the larger arc.

The story is good, but the real beauty is in Nathan Hill's ability to explain senses, feelings, scenes and complicated life entanglements. He does it by nestling story within story like a magical Russian nesting doll. The book is broken into ten parts and a prologue. The ten larger parts have chapters within them. It's a big novel (over 700 pages) but an easy read.

There are a huge number of characters, and they all have their own voices. Never once did I need to remind myself who this person might be. They all have such clear and singular voices that if I was momentarily incognizant, I was quickly reminded by the character herself. Myriad ""non-main"" characters could be easily lost, but Hill builds them so completely, the minute one thinks or speaks, even if the name hasn't stuck with me, I knew where I was and with whom I was dealing. Moreover, somehow all of these characters are integral to the overall story. None are left dangling around the edges. They all fit in somewhere along the line. I wasn't sure that could happen early in the book, but it did. Writing this must have required huge whiteboards or flowcharts. Reading it does not.

I can't neglect to mention the ability with which music and sound are described. As a music lover, I'm often at a loss to explain the way I experience music. Now I will simply use one of the many pages I've marked in this book. Whether or not the author is a musician himself, he understands the way music and sound move us as human beings. He understands a lot about human beings, actually, but it's never schmaltzy. It's often funny. Sometimes it's truly touching, though I never once felt like I was being taught some lesson, forcefed morality or even just emotionally manipulated. It just chugged along being interesting, entertaining, and delightful from beginning to end. I worried in early chapters that Hill was setting his goals too high. I had no cause to fret.

Selfishly I hope THE NIX isn't Nathan Hill's story. I want to read more from this writer. In less gifted hands, this could have been a disaster. Most decidedly it is not. Nathan Hill writes with the surety and confidence his main characters do not have.",1521590400,5,much stori mother son left differ recent releas ive read nix terrif may easili impress run mediocr ive read recent well see feel year think rememb book massiv scope hilar found tell cashier local conveni store chapter found priceless chapter four share glee idea chapter four would serv amusebouch rest amaz novel main charact samuel andresenanderson he close link mother fay left eleven stori samuel learn stori mother mani charact event popul live sever decad move around time move make sen cliffhang within novel mani individu narr feed develop larger arc stori good real beauti nathan hill abil explain sen feel scene complic life entangl nestl stori within stori like magic russian nest doll book broken ten part prologu ten larger part chapter within big novel 700 page easi read huge number charact voic never need remind person might clear singular voic
31221,1569,187,"August or Auggie was born with severe facial deformity caused by the disease called Treacher Collins. Because of his facial features, he became subject for bullies and his mom had him home-schooled to avoid issues from the outside world. Then she decided one day to let her son explore the world and go to normal school. And that's when all sorts of reactions, extreme judgments, peculiar relationships and new-found friendships were established and created.

Told in multiple perspectives, Wonder gives the reader the insights of all the people concerned and surrounded by Auggie. I really love August, he's such a fine young boy and I consider him normal amidst his abnormalities. The universe had been unkind to him, as one of the characters, Miranda, had proclaimed, and it is with a heavy heart that I had to agree with her. But Auggie represents hope and love and all I can see in him is his kind heart.

At first I thought, this whole book should have just been told by Auggie, but then later on, I learned and understood the other characters more, like Via, Summer, Jack, Miranda, and Justin. I was flabbergasted by Auggie's sister, Via because of her selfishness and jealousy towards her brother. I understand where she was coming from, but she's got so many insecurities that it was really hard to like her. She's lucky though, because she had an understanding boyfriend, Justin, whom I admired so much. He's such a good person and treats Auggie and his family with respect and kindness.

I liked Jack too, even though he started out as a jerk too, like the other bully Julian. Jack in the end resolved to be good and redeemed himself and became Auggie's bestfriend. Julian, on the other hand, OMG, I dunno what to do with him. I just can't. He's the epitome of a bully in every sense of the word. Plus his mother, too, ugh, I really don't like them.

This has been a heartbreaking and heartwarming read, I got so much love and so many feels for August Pullman and his family in this wonderful book. Wonder is a kiddie book written by RJ Palacio, but it didn't really feel like it was a children's book, because this one's a little more mature and really interesting and surprisingly tugged at my heartstrings.

I just learned that there are now other mini-novels or companion novels written by Palacio and I really hope to get to read them soon. I don't know about reading Julian's book though, but if it will help me understand him, so be it. :) Now I'm off to watch the movie version!",1521590400,5,august auggi born sever facial deform caus diseas call treacher collin facial featur becam subject bulli mom homeschool avoid issu outsid world decid one day let son explor world go normal school that sort reaction extrem judgment peculiar relationship newfound friendship establish creat told multipl perspect wonder give reader insight peopl concern surround auggi realli love august he fine young boy consid normal amidst abnorm univers unkind one charact miranda proclaim heavi heart agre auggi repres hope love see kind heart first thought whole book told auggi later learn understood charact like via summer jack miranda justin flabbergast auggi sister via selfish jealousi toward brother understand come she got mani insecur realli hard like she lucki though understand boyfriend justin admir much he good person treat auggi famili respect kind like jack even though start jerk like bulli julian jack end resolv good redeem becam auggi bestfriend julian hand omg dunno
31222,1987,2987,"Good for 3rd grade to 6th grade, it tells the story of a girl's life in East Berlin. The wall went up when she was 8 years old, dividing her family in half, and events that happen 4 years later.
Three stars because I thought the story was well paced, but told very superficially, even for a older child's novel.
The main focus of the story was escaping to the west for various reasons. Each person in the family had some specific reason why they want to escape. But the characters were one dimensional, no character development. There isn't much tension in any of the characters except for whether they'll succeed crossing the border or not. A 12-year-old deciding that her freedom of thought was being violated seems unrealistic. I would believe it more for a 14 or 15 year old. Stasi characters where just Stasi enforcing the rules, no explanation as to how or why they are so by the rules, even when given the opportunity that one of the Stasi used to be friends with Fritz.
The novel doesn't really go into many of the reasons why people were so desperate to escape aside from the divided family, and being spied on, which admittedly are very bad already. But it was so superficial that it didn't make you understand or feel the desperation of the people.
Not much on place development. Not sure if the assumption was the reader should already know how bleak it was in East Berlin (which would be a wrong assumption IMHO, given the audience)
Pacing was good enough, there weren't really any slow parts to it.
All in all, it was a decent read.

31224,4828,3528,"I want to thank NetGalley and the publisher for providing a free e-book of this rather short story, which is action-packed, dark and a really quick read -you can read the whole book in one sitting-. The central character, Joe, is an ex-marine war veteran with a history of familial abuse who is hunted by the memories of the monstrous atrocities he witnessed in the battlefield. Joe now works as a ''blacklist freelancer'' in cases of abduction. Joe likes to think that his work restores some kind of balance and justice in an unfair world where those who have the power abuse the weaker members of society. In the first third of the book, the reader gets acquainted with the central character gloomy thoughts and the plot begins when Joe is hired by a U.S. Senator in order to find his underaged daughter who works as a sex-slave after being abducted from a highly-connected and protected, prostitution ring. The story has a nice twist towards the end, but what keeps the reader glued to the text is J. Ames stylised prose which makes ''You Were Never Really Here''' an unforgettable reading experience. The writer manages in a liitle more than one hundred pages to outline a character who reminds the reader of Travis Bickle (''Taxi Driver'' by M. Scorcese) and for whom we feel sympathy despite his extraordinary violent deeds. There is not even one unnecessary phrase in this tightly-plotted and structured short novel and i can recommend it to everyone who is tolerant to descriptions of violent acts and not to the faint-hearted.

31225,4977,2892,"I honestly did not know what to expect going into this one. I thought it was going to give me Red Queen type vibes, which if you know me then you know I didn't like Red Queen, so I was scared. Very scared.

I can honestly say it surprised me. It was a little slow in the first half. I wasn't a huge fan of the way some of the sentences or the conversations between characters were worded. I got over it though. It isn't very assassin in my opinion. If you're looking for that kind of assassin thriller, look into Throne of Glass. What really caught me was the adventure and the mystery aspects of it.

Our main characters really show a lot of growth throughout this novel in many different ways. It was interesting and really kept the pace of the story flowing. For instance, we see Katsa go from her uncles dog to this new hero, in a way. We get to see her reevaluate her Grace and I find that to be an even more interesting aspect. Things aren't always as they seem. Thats for sure.

I was worried we were going to be left with some loose ends, but Cashore wrapped the story up nicely and brought it to an amazing close. I hope we will in fact be seeing more of Katsa in Bitterblue, along with Po.

31228,412,2961,"Robin has taken great pains to build a well-ordered life for herself after enduring the chaos of her youth. Its been over five years since she cut her father out of her life after her mothers death and his subsequent marriage to Tara, a contemporary of Robins who not only used to be Robins close friend, but also was engaged to Alec, Robins brother. And thats just part of the wonderfully complicated family dynamic she so desperately tried to shed.

Its been more than two years since she spoke to her sister, Melanie, or Melanies teenage son, Landon, who has autism. Added to the mix is young Cassidy, Taras 12-year-old daughter from her abusive first husband. So its dysfunction-junction everywhere you look. But now Robin is a successful therapist and engaged to Blake, a dependable, steadfast businessman. Things are finally going her way. Until she gets that phone call.

Melanie leaves Robin a voice mail message with some horrific news. Robins father, Tara and young Cassidy have been shot. Her father is in a coma, and its been touch and go, and Cassidy is gravely wounded as well. Tara was pronounced dead at the scene. They found the front door open and your father and Tara lying on the living room floor, their bodies riddled with bullets, Taras face pretty much blown off, Sheriff Prescott shares with Robin. Could this be a home invasion robbery gone horribly wrong, or is it something more sinister and decidedly more personal? If so, who could carry out such heinous acts on the family? Given the way her father and Tara lived their lives and flaunted their wealth, that list is getting longer by the minute.

Now Robin must return to her hometown of Red Bluff, California, a town she thought she put in her rear view long ago: The towns motto is A Great Place to Live, although Robin had always thought A Great Place to Leave would probably be a more suitable slogan. Aside from its rodeo, Red Bluff was perhaps best known for being the place where a 17-year-old girl was kidnapped by a deranged couple and held captive in a box under their bed for seven yearsback in May 1977, and as far as Robin knew, nothing much of note had happened in the town since. No wonder she wanted to get out and move to L.A. But now shes back and must face her painful past and even more complicated present. The answer she seeks to the question of who could have committed this crime might not be the one she wants or expects.

New York Times bestselling author Joy Fielding is the master of domestic suspense, and with over 25 novels to her credit, she knows a thing or two about plotting an intricately suspenseful story. THE BAD DAUGHTER is a great read for fans of Lisa Gardner, Lisa Scottoline and Karin Slaughter, and for those who want to lose themselves in a compelling page-turner for an afternoon or a lazy weekend. It will have you guessing until the final chapter.

Title: Before We Were Yours by Lisa Wingate

Genre: Historical fiction

Book in a nutshell without spoilers:

This book centers around the experiences of a family of river gypsy children who find themselves in an unbelievable situation with the Tennessee Children's Home Society. The author explores what it was like to be an orphan in the 1920 - 1950's in the Memphis, Tennessee area. I loved how well the author researched the subject material and presented it. I couldn't put the book down. I appreciate that she was willing to tackle difficult issues like fear, resilience, guilt, death and the bonds of love. Overall this book was a great read!

31233,1216,3692,"Zadie Anson knows a lot about mending broken hearts. As a pediatric heart surgeon, that is literally her day job. But she also knows about heartbreak personally, from having lived and loved as a medical resident.

Emma Colley knows a lot about brokenness too. As a trauma surgeon, she has seen more than her fair share of broken bones, broken families, and yes, broken hearts. It's her job to fix what she can and move on, letting specialists step in where needed. She knows a lot about emotional brokenness too, having escaped a childhood of extreme poverty to make her way through college, to medical school and beyond.

For Zadie and Emma--whose friendship formed while they were still in high school--secrets, medicine, and love bound them together for decades. But it was their third year of residency that made their bond virtually indestructible. Even now, as they wrestle with the crammed schedules of work, husbands, and kids, they make sure to check in with each other every week. They have good lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, with lots of love and, laughter, and drinks served poolside at the country club.

And then the past comes waltzing back into their lives. Nick Xenokostas--Dr. X.--was Zadie's boss when she made the biggest mistake of her residency, as well as her lover. And then tragedy struck, sending all their lives indifferent directions. Zadie and Emma were able to move forward as doctors and as friends by leaving the past in the past. But will they be able to maintain that now that the past is back in their lives? Or will Nick's reappearance end the women's friendship, and maybe even one of their careers?

The Queen of Hearts is an engrossing story of medicine, friendship, healing, and love. I've heard it compared to Grey's Anatomy, and as someone who is still a fan of the show, I'd agree. It reminded me of the early seasons (the best seasons), and I read it just as obsessively as I used to watch (and rewatch) those first few seasons. Debut novelist Kimmery Martin is herself a doctor and an admitted avid reader. Her years of reading and reviewing novels shines through her lovely writing. Her characters were perfect for the story and fascinating. I loved this novel, and I recommend it wholeheartedly!

31236,2708,3882,"Gemma Rose is happily packed for a long-awaited and much-postponed holiday in Malta with her policeman boyfriend, Devlin O'Connell. So she is not at all pleased that the holiday must be postponed...again. Luckily, the Old Biddies have a surprise for her. The Old Biddies are a quartet of pensioners who not only help out at The Little Stables Tearoom but get Gemma embroiled in their sleuthing adventures. They have entered Gemma's scones in the Euro-Tearoom Baking Contest, and the scones were selected to represent England at the event being held in Vienna. Since a friend of Gemma's mum is opening a hotel in Vienna, one friendly to animals, why not go, along with Gemma's mischievous cat, Muesli? Gemma and the Old Biddies arrive in Vienna and check in to Sofia Fritzl's hotel. The hotel is just opening and has a number of dignitaries checked in. One of the guests is Moritz Wagner, a well-known critic. Herr Wagner appears to be charming but is really a brutal critic who delights in destroying businesses. The discovery of his body at the hotel is ruled suicide, but the Old Biddies are sure it is murder. What can Gemma do but get involved again? If it is murder, then the old ladies could be in danger. Suspects abound, and the investigation leads Gemma (and Muesli) into hilarious misadventures.

The Oxford Tearoom Mysteries is a favorite series with great characters and atmosphere. Oxford is one of my favorite places and Vienna is a wonderful destination as well. I have spent only a few days there and hope to return one day. In the meantime, I can content myself with the vivid descriptions of the architecture, history, and wonderful food to be found there.

31241,2577,3748,"500 pages. Exactly 500 pages of intense action that made this book difficult to put down. For this reader, this was the first book read by author Mark Greaney. The writing was incredible and realistic. Agent in Place is the 7th book in a series about the Gray Man, Court Gentry, who was a former Christian-In-Action, who continues to provide services to the Agency, as well as his own contract assignments. His assignments are frequently assassinations.

Supporters of the Free Syrian Army are in exile in Paris. They are well funded and are focused on bringing down Syrian President Ahmed Azzam (aka Bashar al-Assad). They learn that Ahmed has a mistress, who is a Spanish model and modeling in Paris. Arrangements are made with Court Gentry to kidnap Bianca Medina, as they know that she knows about a meeting taken in Tehran, that should the Russians discover, perhaps would end the dictatorship of Ahmed.

Court is successful in the kidnapping, only that it was not easy and was most certainly bloody. At the same time the wife of Ahmed, Shakira al-Azzam (Asma al-Assad) is having an affair with her Swiss financial advisor, and he is a dangerous man that is wanted throughout Europe. Shakira learns of her husbands mistress and wants Bianca killed while in Europe. The Free Syrian supporters in Europe learn that Bianca has a son, by Ahmed, in Damascus and refuses to help their cause, unless her son can be brought to Europe.

Once again Court is called upon, as they need him to go to Syria and snatch the child. Now, who would be crazy enough to go to Syria and snatch the son of the president? Well, that would be Court Gentry, who is not a typical man, and has abilities that most could only dream about.

For this reader, reading this novel, it felt like being back on the streets of Damascus. And, what is most interesting is that this novel is in real time, in that the war being fought by several groups is realistically written. It is todays news. Prior to writing the Gray Man series, Mark Greaney had coauthored the late Tom Clancy novels. While this reader has thoughts about franchising a dead mans name for novels, Mark Greaney, in his own name, is simply an exceptional writer of action & adventure novels.

31242,2403,2023,"I have to say that the Aftermath Trilogy is not my favorite of the new Star Wars expanded universe stories. I think I would have actually given this book a lower rating if I read it instead of listening to the audiobook. Marc Thompson is an amazing author and I love to listen to Star Wars books because there is a good chance he is the narrator. I think he does an amazing job with all the different voices that he produces in this book. There are quite a few of them and I think he pulls it off really well. There are a few that sound a little too similar, but I was able to forgive it because he's just so good! Thompson's narration is probably why I actually decided to finish this series in the first place, instead of just DNFing the rest of the series after the first one.

This book was okay, but again like the other two books in this story, we get stuck with these useless ""interludes"". WHY??????? Granted some of these are important to the story because we get Rax's background with The Emperor and I did like the Lando one, but the rest don't really matter to the overall story. The Lando interlude just left me with more questions and I wanted to know what he was doing this whole time. I like the ""main"" storyline in this book, and I would have liked this one better if these interludes just weren't included at all. They annoyed me so much!

The story is interesting, and I liked that we get to see Mon Mothma just be a straight up cunning politician. I also feel conflicted because it feels like she does some shady stuff in this book. I thought the new republic were supposed to be better, but it just feel like the same stuff different name type of thing.

I do love Noora and her crew. I loved that they all kind of became a family together. My heart wrenched for her in this book. That woman has gone through hell and back, and somehow makes it out alive. Poor Wedge! I felt so bad for him in this book. I like this ragtag of rebels so much, that I think it's why I hung in there to finish this series out.

This book isn't my favorite and at the end of the book I felt like I had more questions that answers. You get The Battle of Jakku in this novel, so you understand why it's the way it is when we see it in The Force Awakens, but there are still a lot of things I need to know. Like, who exactly was Rax? And how does Snoke play into all of this? Also, where the hell is Luke? We know Ben (AKA Kylo Ren) hasn't been born yet, so where does Luke fit into the mythology of what happens between Return of The Jedi and The Force Awakens. I think we are slowly getting trickled down books to explain things, but this trilogy was not enough.

I also want to talk about Rae Sloane. I am very conflicted by her, because I don't really like her, but I also don't really hate her. I don't like The Empire, but I think a lot of that stems from knowing that Palpatine was straight up evil. Sloane believes in the stability of The Empire and believes it is something ""good."" She is one of the Imperials that really wants to promote peace, but she believes that the way The Empire does it is the right way. There's a part in the novel where The Empire does something really backhanded and she is used as a distraction, and this horrifies her. Sloane wants to do everything by the books, but she also thinks the rebels are terrorists. I have to admire her for wanting to fight for what she believes in. I also don't know if either The Empire or The Rebellion are ""right"", I think it's a little more complicated than that.

I'm not thrilled with this Trilogy, but I think if you want to know what happens directly after Return of The Jedi they are a good place to start. Also if you want to read about The Battle of Jakku.",1521590400,3,say aftermath trilog favorit new star war expand univers stori think would actual given book lower rate read instead listen audiobook marc thompson amaz author love listen star war book good chanc narrat think amaz job differ voic produc book quit think pull realli well sound littl similar abl forgiv he good thompson narrat probabl actual decid finish seri first place instead dnfing rest seri first one book okay like two book stori get stuck useless interlud grant import stori get rax background emperor like lando one rest dont realli matter overal stori lando interlud left question want know whole time like main storylin book would like one better interlud werent includ annoy much stori interest like get see mon mothma straight cun politician also feel conflict feel like shadi stuff book thought new republ
31243,412,3830,"Someone is watching Anna's home. Whoever it is begins leaving cryptic messages in her mail slot. Based on the descriptive wording used in these notes, it appears that the person behind all of this is her mother or father. There's only one problem: Anna's parents are dead.

Tom and Caroline Johnson died within seven months of each other. The cause in each case was suicide, as both threw themselves off a nearby cliff to their deaths. Even before the weird notes started appearing, Anna knew something was up. She was never comfortable believing that her parents were capable of killing themselves, and is certain they were murdered.

The problem Anna has is convincing anyone of this believed truth. Her sister, Laura, doesn't want to hear it, and the police have better things to do than reopen cases that were neatly closed as suicides. It is at this point that Clare Mackintosh's latest psychological thriller, LET ME LIE, begins to take off. Astute readers will have to buckle up for one heck of a ride, especially since this is a Clare Mackintosh novel.

Mackintosh may not be a household name yet, but she should be. She suffers from what I like to refer to as The Sixth Sense curse. I chose this title in reference to the terrific film by M. Night Shyamalan. The big twist at the end caught pretty much everybody by surprise. It was so clever, in fact, that viewing any future movies by Shyamalan is somewhat ruined due to distraction. The cause of this distraction lies with the viewers themselves, who, instead of sitting back and letting the film wash over them, are spending their time trying to predict when the twist will happen.

I LET YOU GO was Mackintoshs debut, and it had a doozy of a twist --- one of the best I ever read. It was so good that it caused me to spend much of my time reading her follow-up work, I SEE YOU, with my brain trying to work out where and how the twist was going to happen. This second novel was a great read but did not come close to the impact of I LET YOU GO. That brings me back to LET ME LIE. The fact that one of Anna's parents may still be alive is not a surprise or a twist. Actually, we see chapters from their points of view right at the start of the book. Now, all that is left for the reader is to sit back and allow the author to take you along for another very worthwhile journey into the depths of psychological thrills and games that most assuredly will contain twists you will not see coming.

The end of Part One exposes that at least one of Anna's parents is still alive. It is difficult to go much further without revealing some top-notch plotting and additional surprises that Mackintosh has cooked up. It's safe to say that shes no one-trick pony as LET ME LIE is another well-written and incredibly readable thriller. Readers, just like Anna, will find everything they know (or what the author is allowing you to know) stripped away and laid bare until you are left completely exposed and wondering how what you thought to be true could be so far from what actually was going on.

What I kept kicking around in my head as I was reading --- and I challenge my fellow readers to do the same --- is to figure out what the title suggests. Does LET ME LIE represent a plea to allow someone to tell untruths, or is it someone requesting that he or she wants to be left alone? In one case you get a potentially unreliable narrator, and with the other you are allowed the opportunity to dig deeper into a possibly mind-blowing secret. Either way, it adds up to an engaging thriller that should please all fans of this genre and hopefully get new readers to jump on the Clare Mackintosh bandwagon.

31244,686,3901,"In 1950, Idlewild Hall is the place for girls that no one wants. It is home to troublemakers, the outspoken, and illegitimate girls. In the small town, the boarding school is rumored to be haunted and when one of the young boarders suddenly mysteriously disappears nothing will be the same again.

In 2014, it has been twenty years since journalist Fiona Sheridan's older sister's death, but Fiona is having a hard time letting it go. She makes frequent trips to the overgrown fields where the ruins of Idlewild Hall sit. When Fiona hears that someone is buying Idlewild Hall and reopening the school, against her better judgement Fiona decides to take on the story. While researching her story, Fiona comes across a shocking discovery that someone would do anything to keep buried. Who is behind the murders of the two young women?

It was a modern day ghost story and the fact that two young women lost their lives around a school that should serve as sanctuary made this gruesome tale even more delicious. I love the strong female friendship along with the many plot twists. A highly recommended read for anyone who loves thrillers.

31245,1115,3901,"This is a beautiful little book that bounces back and forth between 1950 and 2014 about unwanted girls in a boarding school/home. Then add a murder to it and it ties into a murder in the future. Fiona a journalist steps in to do an article on the restoring of the school and gets more than she bargained for. This book has high suspense, a little romance and a lot of back and forth between a few decades. The characters are all likable and you actually feel sorry and happy for them. There were a few scary parts too. I felt like if it ended with chapter 36, I would have been satisfied. There weren't too many loose ends at that part of thebook to me, but when it got to the epilogue, it made more sense. I love the Dr Phil reference, thanks for adding that. All in all, it's worth reading. I give it 4 stars.

31246,660,3901,"Once I started this book, except for refilling my beer glass, grabbing a quick sandwich and catching a few zzzzs, I didn't put it down. Yes, folks, I loved it - and I heartily thank the publisher, via NetGalley, for the opportunity to read and review it.

The story opens in 1950 at Idlewild Hall in Vermont, a boarding school for girls who just don't fit in anywhere else. Four of the school's incorrigibles become unlikely roommates, and they band together to try and make their lives less miserable and deal with rumors that the school is haunted by a mysterious woman named Mary Hand. Then, one of the four leaves for an unexpected weekend visit with relatives and is never seen again.

Now it's 2014, when the long-abandoned school buildings and property are purchased by a buyer who plans to restore the place to its former glory and reopen it as a school. Local freelance writer Fiona Sheridan decides to do a story on the property. Fiona's interest, though, goes beyond the typical historical approach; 20 years ago, her older sister Deb was murdered - her body dumped in a field near the school. Deb's boyfriend was convicted and has been in jail ever since, but Fiona always suspected he might be innocent. Fiona's boyfriend, local cop Jamie, is less than enthusiastic about digging up old bones (so to speak); but her father, a well-known but mostly retired journalist, stands behind her.

As the story progresses, flashback chapters offer details of what was going on in 1950 from the perspective of each of the four roommates, while ""here and now"" chapters outline Fiona's efforts to gather information for her story. But the more she learns, the more she's sure she still needs to learn - and the more she meets resistance from people who would go to extreme lengths to ensure that what happened in the past stays in the past. Interesting connections turn up, including a tie-in with the Holocaust, and there are more than a few twists (some surprising, others not so much) along the way as well.

Definitely a winner for me - highly recommended!",1521590400,5,start book except refil beer glass grab quick sandwich catch zzzz didnt put ye folk love heartili thank publish via netgalley opportun read review stori open 1950 idlewild hall vermont board school girl dont fit anywher el four school incorrig becom unlik roommat band togeth tri make live le miser deal rumor school haunt mysteri woman name mari hand one four leav unexpect weekend visit rel never seen 2014 longabandon school build properti purchas buyer plan restor place former glori reopen school local freelanc writer fiona sheridan decid stori properti fiona interest though goe beyond typic histor approach 20 year ago older sister deb murder bodi dump field near school deb boyfriend convict jail ever sinc fiona alway suspect might innoc fiona boyfriend local cop jami le enthusiast dig old bone speak father wellknown mostli retir journalist stand behind stori progress flashback chapter offer detail go 1950 perspect four roommat chapter outlin fiona effort gather inform stori learn she sure still need learn meet resist
31247,1173,3901,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, part cold-case mystery, part ghost story, set in Barrons, Vermont. Told with a dual timeline, which connects 'The Broken Girls' of Idlewild Hall back in 1950, to the present day, where journalist Fiona is still seeking answers for the murder of her sister Deb, some twenty years earlier, on the grounds of the boarding school. She refuses to let her murder, as well as the Idlewild girls be forgotten. As Fiona unravels the stories of these forgotten girls, she gradually solves more than one mystery in the process.
This mystery also reads as a ghost story, and being set in a boarding school (one of my favorite settings), means it's rich with atmosphere. The lonely lanes of Barrons, Vermont, highlight the loneliness of the characters in the novel, and there's a sadness throughout as well: the tragedies that led the girls to be at the school in the first place, they were all discarded by their families or by society.
Simone's writing is seamless in weaving the different stories of girls (and Fiona) together to where they complete each other, and with respect to her research, I appreciated her acknowledging in her afterword that she researched Ravensbruck (Nazi concentration camp), which is where one of the characters spent her time as a victim during the war. I can't reveal too much about the ghostly element of the story, plus there's also some 'dirty cop' drama plus a mild romantic conflict, but those do play significant but small parts in the story-line.
If you're looking for a cold-case mystery with elements of a ghost story that is just that right amount of spooky, this is it. Simone has hit the nail on the head.

31248,1938,3901,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I started reading this story but it wasn't the discovery of one of the better ghost stories I've ever read.

This story is told in two time periods - the early 1950s centering around four teenage girls and 2014 centering around journalist Fiona Sheridan. At the very center of the story is Idlewild Hall in Barrons, Vermont - a school for wayward girls.  In 2014 the school has been closed for years but someone has bought the property and is starting to renovate it.

Twenty years ago Fiona's sister was murdered and her body was found on the Idlewood Hall property. As Fiona starts digging into the story of her sister's murder, evil people and ghostly apparitions start to rise to the surface.

I liked the way the story was told so that the reader gets background on when the school was still operating. It reminded me of the movie THE MAGDALENE SISTERS about a Catholic home for wayward girls, although it was scary because it was based on true events, not because of a ghost.

I loved the characters, the storyline, the setting - all came together perfectly for me.

31251,2233,3901,"Wow, this book blew me away! It had everything I love in a book, amazing believable characters, smooth flowing prose, mystery within mystery within mystery. The past and present narrative style works wonderfully in this book and I was equally interested in both parts of the book.

In Barrons, Vermont there was a private school called Idlewild Hall for troubled girls. This could range from those who had suffered mental and emotional trauma, girls that just didn't fit the right mold, girls fathered by someone who wanted to hide these other offsprings to just girls who didn't behave in the way their parents wanted.

In the 1950s there were four very special girls who, living as roommates, struck up a friendship as a way to survive this horrible school and the constant repressive and stagnant nature of teaching. The girls, Cece, Katie, Sonia and Roberta have at one time or another spotted the rumored ghost of Idlewild hall, a mysterious lady veiled, and in black dress. They also hear her say things to them which is personal to each of them. When one of  them goes missing, the others try to solve the mystery.

Flash to 20 years later and the long vacant school and property have been purchased and is rumored to be planned to reopen as a school once again. A young journalist, Fiona Sheridan, is grief stricken at the this thought. Her older sister had been found strangled in the field by the school, her boyfriend being found guilty of the crime and currently in jail.

Some things just aren't adding up for Fiona and with the help of her policeman/boyfriend and fellow journalist she starts to dig and dig for more information about her sisters death and also the person who has purchased the land and why.

There was never a dull moment in this book, I really didn't want to stop reading. The characters were all beautifully well developed and I cared about all of them. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a wonderful, brilliantly written book that will keep you guessing until the satisfying end.

31253,4977,1451,"I read this book for my December group read, so if you're in that group and happen across this post and haven't read the book yet, LOOK AWAY. Its a Throne of Glass book group, so it was described to us as similar, in a way, to Maas with the fae, fantasy mix. I think that holds true to a point but then again obviously its a completely different book by a completely different author.

If you're looking for romance, this is not the book for you. Barrons would make a good love interest and appealed to me personally on Rhys (ACOTAR) levels. I think he would be a good match for Mac later on *hint hint wink wink nudge nudge* and by later on I mean four books, basically five books, in. But youve got about 1,000 pages in between you and even the beginning of romance. I went into it expecting it, don't be me.

The main character, Mac short for Mackayla, starts off very barbie plastic valley girl and, honestly, you may not like her at first. You may not be in love with her the first two or three books, but it is part of her character building. She is witty and adventurous, with a tad bit of dramatic thrown into that mix. This series is very current, its very 21st century so if you likenow novels, this may be the one for you.

I have reviews for the next four books in this series that need to be typed up, so obviously I really enjoyed this book.

31254,84,1438,"Doubleday Books and NetGalley provided me with an electronic copy of The Flight Attendant.  I was under no obligation to review this book and my opinion was freely given.

Cassandra Bowen is used to waking up in strange hotel rooms, as her job as a flight attendant requires stays in cities all around the world.  When she awakens without the knowledge of where she is or what is happening, Cassandra assumes she blacked out while drinking.  After all, she remembers the man from the plane, as well as bits and pieces of the night.  As the fog lifts, Cassie faces a situation of nightmarish proportions.  Will a split second decision change her whole life?

As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that there is more to the book than just a simple mystery.  The espionage aspects of the novel, for the most part, feel placed just to make the plot move in a particular direction.  It was hard to find a connection with the main character, as her unreliability makes her unsympathetic.  Having read previous novels by this author, I found The Flight Attendant to not be up to the usual standards.

Instead, my review will provide my opinions about A Death In Live Oak which will, hopefully, aid you in deciding if it is a book for you.

Overall, I liked all aspects of this book  such as its topical plot concept,  characters, dialogue, action,  writing style; although there were none of these elements that I found to be gripping enough to keep my eyes glued to the page. For the most part I think this is due to this being due my not having read any of the previous books in the Jack Swyteck series, resulting in my not being familiar enough with the back stories of Swyteck and some of the other characters who play a part in A Death In Live Oak. As such, I found myself wanting more character development so that I could feel more involved with the key players.
Further, while the book performed satisfactorily in maintaining my interest throughout, there were times I found the storyline to be somewhat too slow-paced.

Bottom line: I enjoyed my first book in this series but I didn't love it. I expect more experienced readers of this series will have a more intensely positive opinion of A Death In Live Oak.

31261,723,1498,"Great suspense and a surprise ending--all you could ask for in a novel that kept me up half the night finishing. The only flaw was that I felt like I was led to wrong conclusions because of the way Angela(the wife) spoke to her husband(Jason) in the intro. But, the writing was first class, and the plot was tricky, and surprising in the end, a reason for me to read another book by this author.

This is the story of Angela, a victim who finally marries the man of her dream and gets over the trauma of her kidnapping as a teenager. Or did she? The author gives us a wonderfully complex character who is as unforgettable as the woman in Gone Girl. People are complicated in real life, and Alafair Burke certainly knows this and has the ability to portray it in a books which makes his work irresistible to me.

Jason, the husband, seems to be the one thing, but in the end, is far less complex than his wife, which is why this is her story.

Usually Im not a fan of sci-fi, futuristic type things, but I really liked it here with Cinder. Cinder is a cyborg, part robot part human (or is she?). She has a metal arm and leg and a little bit more than that, as we find out later in the story.

Its set post WWIV (World War Four) in New Beijing. So, another nice twist there. I like how it is set somewhere other than New York or Chicago. Sometimes I think authors forget to add some cultural diversity/variety into their stories. I really admire Meyer for mixing it up.

The story is a unique and a very intriguing twist on the classic Cinderella. But there are also other stories intertwined with each other as you will see.

In my opinion, the plot twist was easy to see coming. It was one of my first guesses at the very beginning of the novel. I don't think Meyer hid it very well. There was no surprise factor for me.

31268,4977,3,"This book was very hard to read in one sitting. It is very back and forth between towns, people, etc. There is a lot of information in each chapter and it is very brain stimulating. I honestly don't know what to compare this book to. It is unlike any other book I have ever read. It leaves you wanting more but it is as if the whole book is a learning experience.

In GRRM fashion, the big events happen in the middle and the end. For instance, Battle of the Blackwater in this book. The books go into exquisite detail and make you feel as if you are living the same thing the characters are living. The description of the battle above was literally to a T. Your favorite character is going to die. Count on it. Dont get too attached.

As far as characters go, Daenerys is my favorite. I always look forward to reading her chapters and seeing in what ways her character is developing. Dany gives me life. Jon is a close second on favorites. His character growth is right there with Danys. We watch him go from being the bastard to making a name for himself and finding who he truly is along the way. Theon is my least favorite. He is a try hard. He took love and kindness and acceptance from the Starks but it wasn't enough for him and he felt he had to betray them to win his family over. Which in turn didn't happen.

31269,4977,3560,"Words. I am at a loss for them. Wow.

I love stories that have modern, urban inclusions. I always find it unique when an author incorporates say Ramen or Facebook or Harry Potter into their novel. It helps makes it more relatable and right now. Although it is modernized, it is fairy tale and fantasy.

I found this story to be quite unpredictable. Sometimes you just know whats going to happen. Only once in the five-ish hours it took me to read The Hazel Wood did I even guess a tiny detail. It is not what you expect.

The characters are everything. Alice may be my new favorite little spunky, feisty female protagonist. I would enjoy to know more about Finchs story after Alice (Trying not to spoil here but youll see what I mean if you read.) I am super interested in how this story will continue. It is listed as a series but it wraps up pretty decently, so well see.

31274,2657,437,"This is strong writing, beautiful, but sad.  I saw the movie and finally got around to reading the book.  There is so much philosophy in the book of different teachings and schools, but much is religious Bible teaching.  To love, to forgive and other tenets of Old and New Testament.  Preachy, but preaching is not so bad.

The book begins with the murder of six year old Missy by a deranged child murderer  who killed several little girls.  Missy's father, Mack, and older sister are tormented by guilt, blame themselves.  Mack should have been with his child protecting her.  Kate overturned the boat she and her brother were in causing an accident.  This accident happened when Missy was alone coloring.  The boats' owner blamed himself for letting the kids use the boat.  The book is set on a lake in northeastern Oregon.  Father and three kids are taking a short vacation.

Into this story comes ""The Shack,"" an old rundown building far away from civilization.  It is located far off the road on a small hard to find trail.  Four years later, Mick and Kate are still depressed, can't get over their sorrow, blame, and grief.  But this family will never get over the childs' death, this will be with them until their death.

Mack goes alone, back to the shack on a cold winter day.  This is where he meets God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit.  This is where Mack becomes a different man.  The movie follows the book very well, but there is much written that a movie can't show.  Much philosophies, conversations about many ideas and ideals.  But should some things ever be forgiven?  Well written, giving this reader much to think about.  My daughter recommended that I read it.

31276,194,548,"\65)  The Mountain Between Us  Charles  Martin 3

I enjoyed the survival story in this novel because I like survival stories and man versus nature.

However, I found it hard to believe that an intelligent, efficient, educated, and annoyingly perfect doctor, who's used to thinking under pressure and who also has mad survival skills and wilderness experience, would take a charter flight over rugged and inaccessible mountains directly into a massive winter storm that's grounding commercial flights.  Especially if this charter flight is with an unknown pilot he met ten minutes ago, who he has not vetted or even Googled, and who has admitted he has a heart problem.  Nor would he do this without telling anyone what he was doing.  And would a supposedly smart journalist just go along with this with a man she's just met, also without calling her fiance or her family to let them know what was going on?  And would a competent and responsible pilot agree to fly into this dangerous storm with an overloaded plane but without filing a flight plan?

If you get past the implausibility of it, the crash makes for a good story where you wonder how they'll ever get back to civilization alive, where things often go from bad to worse.

I sometimes wished the flashbacks (well, the recordings) were much shorter so we could get back to the interesting survival story.

The recordings (and a lot of Ben's conversations with Ashley) were so poetic they sounded very written and thus very stilted as speech.  Some was sappy, some pedantic, but he certainly wasn't ""tongue-tied"" or inarticulate or any of the other ways he and Ashley (and apparently Rachel) described him.  This always annoys me, like when beautiful girls complain about how ugly they are (sad if there's an actual self-image problem, but annoying if they're just fishing for compliments).

I wish Ashley had been less passive.

The ending...I'm torn.  It seems more creepy than romantic, but maybe that's just me.

And one insignificant thing that nevertheless bugged me:  There were at least three jokes about Ashley's leg hair and how they wished they could shave it off.  Both of them seemed grossed out, even wilderness-man doctor Ben.  Um...first of all, it's demeaning.  Second, I would be like, ""Yay! Every tiny bit of insulation against the cold counts.  Grow, hair, grow!!!""

Now for the movie (which is a bit off topic in a book review, but I found it interesting to compare).  I know that when you adapt a book to a movie, you have to cut events and entire subplots and play around with other plot points to make it fit into the allotted screen time, make it easier to film, and make it more (arghhh) ""Hollywood.""  Fine.  SPOILER ALERT!!! But when you start completely changing the plot (um, so now her leg isn't really broken?  And it was her idea to charter the planewhich totally changed the dynamic?  And they sleep together?) and totally distorting the characters (Strong, uncomplaining, logical Ben, who is the first to accept their situation, turns into a whining scaredy-cat who's in denial?  Ashley--renamed something for no apparent reason in the movie--changes from whatever-you-think-best woman to take-charge woman)--when you start changing everything so fundamentally, why don't you just MAKE UP YOUR OWN MOVIE?  Okay, rant finished.

Actually, I think the movie was better overall than the book (no creepy ending, no annoying poetic flashbacks, a few things more believable).  But...they're different stories.",1521590400,3,65 mountain u charl martin 3 enjoy surviv stori novel like surviv stori man versu natur howev found hard believ intellig effici educ annoyingli perfect doctor who use think pressur also mad surviv skill wilder experi would take charter flight rug inaccess mountain directli massiv winter storm that ground commerci flight especi charter flight unknown pilot met ten minut ago vet even googl admit heart problem would without tell anyon would supposedli smart journalist go along man she met also without call fianc famili let know go would compet respons pilot agre fli danger storm overload plane without file flight plan get past implaus crash make good stori wonder theyll ever get back civil aliv thing often go bad wors sometim wish flashback well record much shorter could get back interest surviv stori record lot ben convers ashley poetic sound written thu stilt speech sappi pedant certainli wasnt tongueti inarticul way ashley appar rachel describ alway annoy like beauti girl complain ugli sad there

It was with the understanding that I would post a review to Net Galley, Goodreads, Amazon, Barnes and Noble and my nonfiction book review blog. I also posted it to my Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and Google Plus pages.

I requested this book as I have always had an interest in space and science and where we may go in the future.  This is the first book by Michio Kaku that I have read.

The subtitle of this book ""Terraforming, Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality and Our Destiny Beyond Earth"" is a good description of the contents of the book. The author starts out describing what will eventually happen to the Earth using other solar systems as examples. He then launches into a number of topics dealing with the subject.

The author's writing style is engaging making this an enjoyable read. While the author does project his thoughts on the subject, he also uses the thoughts and theories of several others. Some of his time frames for events are well documented while others are somewhat more nebulous.

I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in ways that humanity can survive in the long-term (millions and billions of years). You will not be disappointed.

31284,3038,1438,"""Negronis in Rome. Akvavit in Stockholm. Arak in Dubai. Her life was a drinking tour of the world.""

What a sexy and intelligent thriller!!! The author has done his homework and it shows!

""God, it was just like so many of the other times she had woken up naked and hungover in bed with a guy, with only the slightest idea how she had gotten thereexcept this time the guy was dead.""

This book starts with a bang. Cassie is an experienced flight attendant, who works on international flights and drinks far, far too much. She has blackouts, has sex with strangers and cannot go more than a few days without a drink. But did she kill the sexy businessman she met on a flight to Dubai?
She does not have a full grasp of the previous night's events and can only recall fleeting moments. She does know one thing for sure: she and her date both drank to excess the night before.

""The notion that he, too, was a boozerat least for one nightcaused her to feel a deep, wistful ache in her heart. Everyone who drank the way she did had a reason, she supposed, and she had never pressed him for his. Did he have one? Now shed never know. Certainly he had never wondered about her own private pain.""

Cassie falls deeper and deeper into deception BUT it soon becomes clear that she did not kill the handsome Alex. But Cassie continues to deceive everyone who cares about her and even herself. She lies about her drinking, her whereabouts the night of the murder and her lies keep spinning out of control.

""She had made her choicejust one more bad choice in a life riddled with themand there was no turning back.""

This is a very detailed and slow-building thriller. I felt completely immersed in the world of the flight attendants and modern-day international travel. The plot takes Cassie all over the world and the cast of characters is fascinating! Although many would find Cassie to be an unsympathetic character, I actually liked her and understood some of her choices (although I did not always agree with them!)

""Of course, that was the one constant in her life: she drank. Alcohol gave her pleasure and it gave her courage and it gave her comfort. It didn't precisely give her self-esteem (especially not the next morning), but it gave her the faith that whatever she was, was enough.""

Prepare to be completely taken by surprise with the ending. I was shocked!! (Not easy to do.) All the praise to Chris Bohjalian!! This book is well-researched, sexy, smart and surprising. I can definitely see this as a movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this engaging and often witty thriller.

31285,2095,82,"Before I begin my review for Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, I should tell you that I am a huge Neil deGrasse Tyson fan. This man changed my life a few years ago when he opened my eyes to the science of the Universe and the beginning of life. Suddenly, the world didn't seem small.

In saying that, I promised myself, for the sake of Word Gurgle, that I would read and review this book with an open mind and unbiased opinion.

I'm kidding.  I purchased this novel, so I'll review it any way I choose.

Dr. Tyson does a fantastic job simplifying everything any ordinary, non-scientific person needs to know. It was easy to read, easy to understand and never got boring. He took a subject that normally intimidated me and turned it into something understandable. He always does. It's probably the reason why I've developed a love and adoration for the cosmos over the last few years.

31286,2949,1076,"This is a really excellent non-fiction book.  I am one of those people weighing cremation vs. embalming for myself and my husband.  The book may help you make up your mind if you're in that position.  But that is not the purpose of the book.  Caitlin Doughty wants us to give far more thought to the way we deal with death.  Caitlin is 23-years-old when she takes a job at a crematory in the San Francisco Bay area.  She has absolutely no experience, but to her advantage, she has no aversion to death either.  In fact she is very interested in death.

Each chapter in her book is a separate story.  She describes both cremation and embalming in great detail so if this will bother you, don't read the book.  She talks about going to homes to pick up the deceased, going to hospitals to pick up groups of dead babies, the rare family participation in cremations, the Golden Gate Bridge jumpers, having heads delivered to the crematory, the yearly scattering of ashes in the Pacific Ocean, and the yearly burial of unclaimed cremains.  In one chapter, she contemplates suicide after a relationship fails that never really existed.  She will make you laugh, cry and quite likely feel guilty.  She feels guilt herself when she doesn't take more of a leadership role in her grandmother's funeral.

Doughty relates in detail how some other cultures deal with their dead bodies.  We would think most of them to be gross and horrible, but they make sense when she explains why they believe what they do.  (Well, maybe the cannibalism one not so much.)  She also gives the history of the funeral industry in this country.  It started at the time of the Civil War when there were so many dead bodies, and no one had planned ahead on what to do with them.  One of the books in her ""Notes on Sources"" is ""The Republic of Suffering:  Death and the American Civil War"" by Drew Gilpin Faust.  I have read this book, and I heartily recommend it.

Doughty's belief is that the way death was handled 100+ years ago is far preferable to the gigantic mortuary business we now have.  She would like us to go back to the time when death was normal and natural, not something to be feared.  As she writtes in the book, after birth, each day is just one step closer to death.  Her preferred scenario would be that a death occurs at home, the decedent is washed and dressed by the family, and lies in state at home for a day or so.  During that time, someone builds a coffin.

Her real belief seems to be in green funerals - no embalming, no cremation, either straight burial in the ground or no burial at all, allowing animals, birds, and insects to consume the body.  She writes that she has been eating animals all her life; this would be her chance to give back by allowing them to eat her.

Doughty is also critical of keeping old people alive for no good reason.  She fears that as we keep our seniors alive longer, there will be no one to take care of them.

This book is not for everyone, but I am glad I read it.  If she writes another, I would definitely read it.",1521590400,5,realli excel nonfict book one peopl weigh cremat v embalm husband book may help make mind your posit purpos book caitlin doughti want u give far thought way deal death caitlin 23yearsold take job crematori san francisco bay area absolut experi advantag avers death either fact interest death chapter book separ stori describ cremat embalm great detail bother dont read book talk go home pick deceas go hospit pick group dead babi rare famili particip cremat golden gate bridg jumper head deliv crematori yearli scatter ash pacif ocean yearli burial unclaim cremain one chapter contempl suicid relationship fail never realli exist make laugh cri quit like feel guilti feel guilt doesnt take leadership role grandmoth funer doughti relat detail cultur deal dead bodi would think gross horribl make sen explain believ well mayb cannib one much also give histori funer industri countri start time civil war mani dead bodi
31287,412,1438,"Jet setting sounds like such a glamorous job. Flying around for free. The airline puts you up at a hotel, no cost to you. With enough seniority, you can get the more exotic routes, say to London, Rome or Paris. But for one woman, the job is anything but glamorous.

Cassandra Bowden, a long-time flight attendant, is too self-destructive. She knows it, yet still gets blackout drunk and picks up guys in bars --- all over the globe. Cassie loves alcohol, and she loves sex. Most of all, she loves them together. She prefers picking up men on trips, away from home, so theres less chance of a relationship forming. Anonymous sex works best for Cassie. No strings, no guilt, no exchange of phone numbers. One-night stands are her norm. That way, its all just harmless fun.

Predictably, one night it isn't all harmless fun. Not in the least. In fact, it turns very bad. Not that this is the first one thats turned bad. But none have ever turned this kind of bad. The morning after, Cassie wakes up next to a dead guy. Someone cut his throat while she slept next to him. Theres blood everywhere. And she's in his hotel room, in Dubai. What now? Well, besides her alcoholic sex binges, Cassie is famous for her dreadful judgment. So, of course, she makes matters far worse. She panics and skips out. All Cassie wants to do is get home, forget the awful scene in the hotel room and hope no one connects the dots. That won't happen. Because someone out there knows. Someone out there murdered her one-night stand. That is, unless she did it. But she couldn't have. Could she? The trouble is, she cant remember.

Well, if this doesn't make her stop drinking, nothing will. Cassie promises herself: No more booze. Thats it; shes done. She cant trust herself when shes drunk. But somehow, that doesnt seem to matter. Her judgment is so impaired and her life is such a mess that she goes forward still guzzling the drinks and making bad decisions. If waking up next to a dead guy won't shock her out of her ceaseless self-destruction, is there any hope for Cassandra Bowden? Amazingly, yes. Theres one thing that might get her to stop drinking. And no one saw it coming. So, from there, who knows what can happen for her? Better choices? Thats where hope comes in.

Chris Bohjalian is a master of suspense and pacing. In THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT, his main character is a beautiful woman named Cassandra. In Greek mythology, Cassandra was a beautiful woman cursed with not being believed. That is fitting because Cassandra Bowden lies at least as often as she tells the truth. And the truth here is very frightening. But no one will listen. She is a sympathetic character who is hard to like, yet you want to root for her. Shes her own worst enemy, and you cant help but feel that she shouldnt be punished for the kind of horrible judgment she exhibits if shes guilty of nothing else.

Come on, Cassandra, get a grip on yourself. The rest of your life depends on it. Well, she might surprise you. Brace yourself for a blockbuster ending!

31295,2646,2838,"Thank you to William Morrow Books #Partner for this free copy, in exchange of an honest review. All opinions are my own.

I rate this book a 4 out of 5 Stars.

Once I started this one, I was addicted. I could not put it down. I love how all of the characters had some attachment to one another. It's kind of like the six degrees of separation. Which is fascinating to me. This was my first Alison Gaylin read, and I cannot wait to read more. I have to say, of all the characters in this book, I really loved Pearl. She was so intuitive, and like-able. I think she added so much charisma to the story.

This book takes on the subject of bullying, via social media, and in the hallways of schools, even adults were in on the bullying. It gives some insight to mob mentality as well, how someone is designated the bad guy, and everyone else hops on to that bandwagon.

31298,2887,844,"My opinion of SOMETIMES I LIE changed constantly. Honestly, it's a one or two star book for most of it that moves into the four-star area in plot only at the very end. I nearly stopped a few times, but I got it after a wait list, and I couldn't just get it back, so I plodded on. Yet another present-past-present-past formula. It's about a woman in a coma. Exciting! Also, do they not have catheters in the UK?

Once I got past the irritation of some incorrect medical possibilities, the silly format, play-by-play of every single moment of the coma, and multiple long slow sections of childhood diaries, there was a decent book hiding somewhere inside. Actually, I think there's a decent *movie* hiding inside. I don't know that this could be a great book without a whole new writer. It felt very much like a screenplay to me.

I did get to a point where I wanted to know what happened. We go a very long time with nothing happening. It's all foreshadowing. Then in the final fifth(?) of the book, about a thousand twists all just start coming one after the other. I knew a few things would happen. I'd also guessed one of the biggest in a way. I wasn't exactly correct, but I was not entirely off. I just had the reason for the ""reveal"" down to something slightly different than it was. Outcome was the same.

So this book felt to me like a screenplay for a rollercoaster that starts off going straight for about four painstaking miles, then in the last mile it not only has steep drops, but also loops and upside-down twirls and adds water and some poodles and there's a clown under your seat. It was a lot. It was overkill.

31299,412,844,"I have to confess that I have gotten somewhat jaded with the unreliable narrator plot that seems to drive a great number of thrillers being published these days. They certainly continue to be popular, and God bless. There are enough books of wide variety out there that one can hardly feel deprived of new reading material, regardless of interest or preference. But a terrific book is a terrific book, and Alice Feeneys debut is an unreliable narrator tale that is one of those.

SOMETIMES I LIE moves from time to time to time, that being primarily (with a couple of exceptions near its conclusion) the books Now, Then and Before. Now is the 10 or so days from December 26th (Boxing Day, for our British friends) to January 3rd, while Then is the week prior. Both sections are narrated in the first person by Amber Reynolds, who in the Now is in a coma, nonresponsive but very much aware of what is going on around her. She has no idea how she got where she is. However, as conversations occur around and over her, what is said and what is not leads her to believe that either her husband Paul or her sister Claire --- or both --- might have had something to do with it.

It is the Then, though, that comprises the most intriguing sections. Amber is employed by a local radio station and is partnered with Madeline Frost, the stations Queen Bee. Frost has been the host of a top-rated morning radio program for two decades, and her helpful public persona is nothing like her private demeanor. Here, the reader gains some insight into the workings of Amber, and its obvious shes not quite right. This is reinforced in the Before sections (you thought I had forgotten about those, didn't you?), which consist of excerpts from a diary written some 24 years prior to the books Now and deal in part with Ambers childhood at age 10 and her friendship with a lonely girl who, for better and for worse, will have an influence on her that will transcend their school years.

Meanwhile, in the present, Ambers problems extend beyond her comatose state. Someone keeps visiting her hospital bedside and does not seem to mean her well. Amber has no idea who this person is, but he or she certainly knows her. The problem is that Amber cant do anything about it, given that she is trapped in her body. Youll be asking yourself throughout how Amber is going to get out of her situation --- even after you find out the truth --- but when you learn the answer and its full ramifications, youll want to reread the book just to witness how Feeney pulls things off.

Let me elaborate on the pulls things off statement. Feeney spends the first third or so of SOMETIMES I LIE setting up the dominoes, the middle third making you think there aren't any dominoes, and the final third throwing them all over the room. But there is a precise order to it, with a bit of justice and revenge thrown in for good measure, as well as a concluding sentence that surprises and chills. The result is a one-sit read that keeps you guessing and wondering, even after youve finished the book, from an author to watch in the future.

31300,2543,3499,"""The Sandman"" is one of those dark Scandinavian thrillers that are both atmospheric and keep you reading to find out how it ends. In this case, the story follows Sweden's most dangerous serial killer, Jurek Walter, who is locked up in a psych ward, under the care of Dr. Anders (who, as the story progresses, yields his own dark personality). Jurek is treated like a dangerous beast and constantly given meds to make him sleepy. However, after one of his victims, Mikael, unexpectedly appears from his captivity and says that his missing sister, who was kidnapped with him is still alive, the mission becomes to do everything possible to get Jurek to reveal her whereabouts.

Eventually, a young policewoman--Saga--is brought in, and pretends to be one of the patients, in order to befriend Jurek and get the information out of him. Of course, as Saga soon learns, Jurek is not the only dangerous man in the psych ward.

Initially, this book was a little hard to get into and occasionally confusing due to the chapters jumping back and forth between the characters, However, because the characters were so short, I stuck through it and eventually the read became interesting. The writing read more like a movie script than a novel, with short chapters and more of a focus on action. It was also thoughtful, with readers receiving a full explanation at the end as the mystery gets resolved, of the strong motivations behind it. Overall, an interesting read.",1521590400,4,sandman one dark scandinavian thriller atmospher keep read find end case stori follow sweden danger serial killer jurek walter lock psych ward care dr ander stori progress yield dark person jurek treat like danger beast constantli given med make sleepi howev one victim mikael unexpectedli appear captiv say miss sister kidnap still aliv mission becom everyth possibl get jurek reveal whereabout eventu young policewomansagai brought pretend one patient order befriend jurek get inform cours saga soon learn jurek danger man psych ward initi book littl hard get occasion confus due chapter jump back forth charact howev charact short stuck eventu read becam interest write read like movi script novel short chapter focu action also thought reader receiv full explan end mysteri get resolv strong motiv behind overal interest read

How would you live your last 24 hours? Would you have a funeral with your family and friends so that you have a chance to say goodbye, or would you try and make a new friend going through the same thing you were so that you don't have to be alone on your last day on this planet? This is exactly what happens to both Rufus and Mateo.
Rufus is outgoing and not afraid to stand up for himself. Hes had a pretty crappy few years but hes managed to make friends with the other kids in his foster home. They have become his family. He gets the call that everyone dreads informing him that hes going to die today. He decides to download the Last Friend app so that he can get paired up with someone to spend his last 24 hours with.
Mateo is a quiet and somewhat sheltered teenager who has been living on his own since his dad is currently in a coma. He gets the call that he is going to die today and he is instantly terrified to leave his apartment. He quickly decides that he doesnt want to die alone, so he downloads the Last Friend App in hopes that he will come out of his shell on his last day.
Mateo and Rufus meet through the Last Friend App and have an amazingly memorable final 24 hours together. The bring about change in each other that they never thought was possible.
These characters are so easy to relate to and its so hard not to love them. I couldn't help but laugh with them and cheer for them, and though I did everything in my power not to cry with them I couldn't stop myself from crying crocodile tears over their trials and tribulations.  This story is about growing, changing as a person and allowing yourself to love and be loved in the wake of great adversity.

31303,1841,3826,"This was an enjoyable story about two seemingly very different people.  It was hard to figure out how they would end up together and I'm still confused as to how they will work this out.  They don't really discuss it, which I found odd.  I liked the characters a lot and found the plot interesting.  There were some exciting moments, some cute ones and a bit of romance.  Alice is spunky and sometimes talks before she speaks while Calvin is very closemouthed and careful.  He's also struggling with his faith while Alice's seems strong.  I found it frustrating that Alice doesn't think of someone who seems obvious as the culprit.  I also thought she was going to do something about the parent of a child she teaches but nothing ever came of it and it seemed like a very big issue to just walk away from. Sometimes an odd word or phrase was used that didn't seem to fit and at one point, Alice prayed for two people who were already dead, which I thought was strange.  Both Calvin and her friend Irene grew up Amish but in abusive or neglectful households and each struggle with rejection and loneliness.  They also have low self-worth.  The story deals with some hard things but it's fairly light and has some humor in it.  It can be read as a stand-alone but some of the characters were in previous books.  Overall, I liked it and recommend it if you like Amish stories.

31304,3455,3752,"Polly (Pauline) is an enigmatic woman who has plotted to leave her second husband and child in order to restart with the life she had always dreamed of. Set in the summer of 1995, Polly while on her way to resetting, ends up in Belville, Delaware. Here she crosses paths with the charmingly handsome Adam Bosk, the private investigator who was hired to seek out information on Polly. Soon after Polly and Adam find themselves intertwined, but when an explosion leading to a death occurs in Pollys apartment, thing become a bit skewed. Filled with deceit, secrets, and lies; nothing is as it seems.

This novel has tons of drama and I started it thinking it would be a book Id have some major heart-eyes over, but unfortunately there were a few things I did not enjoy. Laura Lippman is a great story teller with the strong ability to create characters with complex backgrounds; and characters are something this novel definitely does not lack. Some may find a story being told from multiple points of view to be rather confusing, while others may enjoy it. I found myself becoming lost in keeping up with who is who as additional character point of views were introduced.  Due to this, there were many points in the story where things became very convoluted. It also brought on some difficultly in drawing connections between all these characters. Ultimately, the biggest issue I had with the characterization was I failed to understand what some characters, or their point of view, brought to enhance the story. None of the characters are truly likable, and I felt the reader is never given the true opportunity to get to know them well enough to even reach that point.

Of all the characters, I had the most difficulty connecting with the storys main character, Polly. As a mother, I had such difficult understand how she could abandoned her children. This is something I could never wrap my head around and ultimately brought on huge dislike for Polly. Another thing I found to be unclear was how Polly and Adam instantly fell in love. While this is endearing, it is not conceivable. When did this happen? At what point did I miss this spark between them? Because of this lapse in the story line, and sprinkle in Pollys prior tarnished relationships, I had a hard time putting any emotion into their relationship or rooting for its success. Another fault was the abusiveness shown towards women (Polly in particular) that are splattered among these pages. The domestic drama was a huge no go for me and was tough to swallow. I think this made up the largest part of my displeasure in this novel. I would not consider advising of this inclusion to be consider a spoiler, but more of a warning to those that are also uncomfortable by this.

On the positive side, I did thoroughly enjoy the setting being in 1995. This gave me a lot of nostalgia with all the references Lippman made to this era.  Also, it was clever of her to use this time frame as a setting given that crimes and the detection of missing persons were more trying during this period.  I will say, Laura Lippman has always had quite the ability to engage her reader and keep them flipping through the pages of her novels. She ends each chapter masterfully and it left me at the edge of my seat wanting to know whats next. THIS is something I have always enjoyed about her novels.

The ending, although abrupt, did come as a surprise to me. I did not see the story taking that turn. However, I would not categorize this as a thriller, it was more as a multi-layered cat and mouse puzzle. Overall, Sunburn was a fast paced easy read and I did not dislike it. Mostly I appreciated it. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to read a psychological thriller that is a bit different than those it sits upon a shelf with.

31305,170,3665,"It's an annual event for me to pick up the new Serge Storms novel early in the year by buying it at a live appearance by Tim Dorsey. This time he walked into the Barnes and Noble looking visibly shaken and announced that there would be no humorous introduction or reading as us usual. Why? This was in South Florida and Tim was staying at the local hotel where parents were gathering to see if their kids were any of the 17 killed at Stoneham Douglas high and he observed the tension and heartbreak in the lobby.

For those of you not familiar with this series (this is the 21st), the principal character is Serge Storms, a serial killer who only harms those who would injure Florida or Florida's vulnerable members of the populace. He always arranges to give the bad guys an out but so far, none seem to take advantage of it. In the meantime, he and his sidekick Coleman a drug and booze addled travel buddy tour the state with Serge dropping trivia notes as he moves about. This one centers on Rivera Beach, a spot I have often used to depart for drift diving in the Gulf Stream so fun to get filled in on it's early history and notable spots.

31306,2005,3876,"Although Mary Crampton had dreams of being an artist when she was younger, she stayed on in the dying town of Petroleum.  She lives with her father in the towns funeral home and works as the embalmer.  She now directs her art to the deceased that she works on, making them appear to be almost alive to help their loved ones through the funeral services.  Shes a lonely woman and uncomfortable socializing.  She feels more at ease with the dead than with the living.  The local children taunt her and call her Freak.

Petroleum is a struggling town and has been disintegrating since an accident twenty years prior took the life of a beloved high school athlete, Eddie Golden.  His younger brother, Robert, only 14 years old at the time, was blamed for the accident.  The granary was shut down and the train no longer came to town.  But now Roberts mother is dying and Robert has returned to Petroleum to care for her.  When Mary becomes friends with Robert, it sets off old resentments throughout the town and ignites old dreams in Marys heart.

This is a tender, heartfelt, gem of a book.  Every word of it made its way into my heart to stay.  This is a very talented author who writes like a poet with a powerful emotional punch.  I found this book to be completely breathtaking and I read it in a single day as I couldn't bear to part with it.  So lovely, so haunting, so human.

31308,890,3429,"Ill read the second book in the series when it comes out but I cant quite put my finger on whether or not I actually enjoyed this one.

I first picked up the book because of the cover, which is a bright blue background and has large white letters for the title. I promised myself I wouldnt buy another book at the time, but I kept coming back to it. Finally I was able to snag it at the library.

In 1936, Albert Ellingham built an elite private school (but tuition-free!) in Vermont for children of all ages to practice their own interests, to engage in puzzles, read books, and really explore the world around them. Being a fun of mazes and riddles, the campus is also home to a multitude of hidden nooks and crannies. However, she and Iris, her mother, were kidnapped and held for ransom. Iriss body was recovered a few weeks later, but not Alices. The only clue left behind was a mocking riddle from Truly Devious, a pseudonym.

Decades later, Stevie Bell has arrived on campus and is eager to solve the crime. Fancying herself an amateur sleuth, she believes that she has found the missing link to clear the alleged killers name and bring the real one to justice. Then, its onto the FBI, where her real life can begin. Before she can crack open the old case, however, she has to adjust to being away from home, learn how to make friends, and manage her anxiety.

I thought Stevie was a good character. She was strong and embraced her differences, but not at the expense of belittling females who are interested in make-up or being a cheerleader  which is also what her conservative, traditional parents want her to be. I didn't care too much about the other characters. I didn't think we spent enough time with them to really gauge their personalities, and I wished that we were shown more of Janelle and Stevies friendship. Good female friendships are hard to come by!

My issue was also with pacing. The book is set across two timelines: 1936 and present day, with a murder mystery in each one. The problem was, we didn't get to the murder in the present day period until halfway through the book. I felt like in that regard, it took too long for the story to get started.

I find myself thinking and re-thinking about the end. I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know, it was hard for me to really get into the book and then to come to the end so abruptly..

31318,4940,505,"Synopsis.......

The story takes place in the extreme conditions of the Yukon during the 19th-century Klondike Gold Rush, where strong sled dogs were in high demand. After Buck, a domesticated dog, is snatched from a pastoral ranch in California, he is sold into a brutal life as a sled dog. The novella details Buck's struggle to adjust and survive the cruel treatment he receives from humans, other dogs, and nature. He eventually sheds the veneer of civilization altogether and instead relies on primordial instincts and the lessons he has learned to become a respected and feared leader in the wild.

Published back in 1903 after the author had spent sometime in the aforementioned Yukon.

I was looking for something a little bit different and quick to read after getting bogged down by another book which I wasn't enjoying.

I had previously heard of this book, hasn't everyone(?) but can't recall reading it ever during my near half-century of years, not even in the dim and distant days of school. Glad I made the effort though.

Gripping, exciting, moving.......a testament of an indomitable spirit, bravery, determination, loyalty, fearlessness, and probably another dozen or so admirable attributes. Sad in places, but ultimately an uplifting and rewarding read.

I wouldn't put it past me finding more from London in the future.

Its definitely intriguing and different which is why I think I liked it. I would say it was different from any book Ive ever read. Some parts are hard to follow and don't really make sense until the end. I feel like this is mainly so because we are being introduced to a whole new world we have never heard of and Roth dives right in.

Cryas point of view, and her character as a whole, was way more appealing to me that Akos. Her character develops so much in this book its unreal. You see her go from being scared and unsure of herself to brave and unrelenting. Her character changes and growth are quite literally shown through her current gift.

Would I recommend this book? Probably not. There was so much going on in this book that I actually couldn't tell you whether or not every question I had pop up was answered by Roth in the end. If someone asked me about it I would tell them to read at their own risk. Just because I liked it doesnt mean others will as well.

31326,2923,42,"Annihilation clawed its way onto my all-time favorites list when I read it back in January. I finally picked up a copy of Authority recently and made my way back into the world of the Southern Reach. A friend of mine had warned me that the sequel was entirely different, and she was right. Authority is more of a behind-the-scenes look at the goings on of the mysterious government agency in charge of the expeditions. While some questions are answered, far more are dredged up.

Jeff VanderMeer blew me away with his writing once again. From the narrative voice to the characters, I found myself drawn into the story and into Controls mind. I was as desperate to untangle the secrets as he was. While the middle lagged a bit as far as interest goes, the end of the book pulls the reader down under a wave of action and tension. After turning the last page, I found myself shaken and thirsting for the next book.

Authority is a fantastic sequel, although it doesnt hold up to Annihilation in my book, mainly due to the lulls that made it hard to push through the middle. VanderMeer continues the captivating and enigmatic story of Area X and the Southern Reach and leaves you wanting more.

31338,630,3332,"She has the keys to their apartment. She knows everything. She has embedded herself so deeply in their lives that it now seems impossible to remove her.

  When Myriam decides to return to work as a lawyer after having children, she and her husband look for the perfect nanny for their son and daughter. They never dreamed they would find Louise: a quiet, polite, devoted woman who sings to the children, cleans the familys chic Paris apartment, stays late without complaint, and hosts enviable kiddie parties. But as the couple and the nanny become more dependent on one another, jealousy, resentment, and suspicions mount, shattering the idyllic tableau. Building tension with every page, The Perfect Nanny is a compulsive, riveting, bravely observed exploration of power, class, race, domesticity, motherhood, and madnessand the American debut of an immensely talented writer.

My Thoughts: Perfection, or the appearance of it, is a theme in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Nanny-A-Novel/dp/B07178T7YP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Nanny: A Novel</a>. We see examples of the well-ordered world the nanny creates for the Masses family on a lovely Paris street. She makes their lives easy, with her tireless care, the cleaning, the dinners, and the willingness to stay late.

But beneath the faade, Louise is a complex mix of disordered thoughts, fantasies, fears, and intensity. Back and forth the story goes, offering glimpses of other lives the woman has lived, including one with a very troubled daughter.

As she slowly unravels before their eyes, Myriam and Paul try to sort through their thoughts and decide how to extricate their lives from hers. It should be simple, right? But Louise has so carefully inserted herself into their family that removing her seems impossible.

In the beginning, we know the ending. As we turn the pages, fear and curiosity keep us going, even as spending another minute in Louises mind seems too horrific to bear. A creepy tale of madness, obsession, and the power of routines, at times I wanted to stop reading. But like the Masses family, who could not rid themselves of her, I was unable to extricate myself from this character study of a fascinating and disturbing woman. 4 stars.",1521676800,4,key apart know everyth embed deepli live seem imposs remov myriam decid return work lawyer child husband look perfect nanni son daughter never dream would find louis quiet polit devot woman sing child clean famili chic pari apart stay late without complaint host enviabl kiddi parti coupl nanni becom depend one anoth jealousi resent suspicion mount shatter idyl tableau build tension everi page perfect nanni compuls rivet brave observ explor power class race domest motherhood madnessand american debut immens talent writer thought perfect appear theme innbspa datahookproductlinklink classalinknorm hreftheperfectnannyanoveldpb07178t7yprefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieutf8th perfect nanni novela see exampl wellord world nanni creat mass famili love pari street make live easi tireless care clean dinner willing stay late beneath faad louis complex mix disord thought fantasi fear intens back forth stori goe offer glimps live woman live includ one troubl daughter slowli unravel eye myriam paul tri sort thought decid extric live simpl right louis care insert famili remov seem imposs begin know end turn page fear curio keep u go even spend
31339,481,2681,"MARCH 2018 REVIEW

It's late 1987 and Kinsey Millhone is a 37-year-old private detective in Santa Teresa, CA.  Her cantankerous neighbor, Gus, is badly injured in a fall.  His only living relative is a niece in New York and can't care for him so she hires Solana Rojas, a private nurse, to help him while he recuperates.  The niece hires Kinsey to check out Solana and everything seems okay.  But Kinsey becomes suspicious of Solana when Solana doesn't allow anyone to see Gus, is cleaning his place out and is rude.

In the meantime, Kinsey is investigating a case of possible insurance fraud involving a woman who drove into another car. The female passenger in the other car had serious injuries and she and her husband are suing.  Kinsey must track down a reluctant witness who can tell what really happened.

I thought this story was okay.  It was interesting to see how manipulative a person can be and get away with it.  It's written in first person perspective in Kinsey's voice but in third person perspective when it's Solana's voice.  As a head's up, there is swearing.

This is the twentieth in the ""alphabet series"" featuring Kinsey Millhone.  Though it is part of a series, it works as a stand alone.  I discovered this series in the mid-1990s and have read them all.  I started rereading them last year.  With the author's recent death, Y is for Yesterday will be the end of the series.

JUNE 2008 REVIEW

It's been a while since I've read a Kinsey Millhone story (because there haven't been any since 2005) so it was good to read ""T"".

There's a lot I liked about this book. It was interesting to read two ""voices"" ... Kinsey's and Solana's. It worked for me. The main story was a bit extreme at times but I enjoyed it.

There was a subplot that could have had a different slant rather than the heavy child molestation. Some of the characters were very convenient.

All in all, I'd recommend this book.",1521676800,3,march 2018 review late 1987 kinsey millhon 37yearold privat detect santa teresa ca cantanker neighbor gu badli injur fall live rel niec new york cant care hire solana roja privat nurs help recuper niec hire kinsey check solana everyth seem okay kinsey becom suspici solana solana doesnt allow anyon see gu clean place rude meantim kinsey investig case possibl insur fraud involv woman drove anoth car femal passeng car seriou injuri husband su kinsey must track reluct wit tell realli happen thought stori okay interest see manipul person get away written first person perspect kinsey voic third person perspect solana voic head swear twentieth alphabet seri featur kinsey millhon though part seri work stand alon discov seri mid1990 read start reread last year author recent death yesterday end seri june 2008 review sinc ive read kinsey millhon stori havent sinc 2005 good read there lot like book interest read two voic kinsey solana work main stori

31342,441,3882,"H. Y. Hanna has written another wonderful adventure for Gemma, with a little murder thrown in.  Although she's supposed to be going on holiday with Devlin in Malta, a change in plans finds Gemma in Vienna (with the Old Biddies no less) to accept an award for making the best scones in England.  They end up staying at a newly opened boutique hotel owned by her Mother's old school friend Sophia Fritzl and are having a wonderful time exploring and experiencing all the sights in Vienna when one of the hotel's guests dies under mysterious circumstances.  Unlike in Oxford, Gemma has no connections with the Viennese police department, thus they summarily dismiss her concerns that the death could be murder.  Consequently, Gemma and the Old Biddies decide to look into the death themselves.

I enjoyed this book so much and was ready to book a trip to Vienna half-way through.  The descriptions of various places in Vienna -- the cafs, museums and Lipizzaner horses, in particular, drew me into the book.  I found myself googling a lot of the places mentioned, and they are just as H.Y. Hanna described.  The Old Biddies were once again at their best, getting Gemma into awkward situations, while Gemma's Mother's attempt at Face-timing her was hilarious.  I love a good mystery where the characters don't take themselves too seriously, and Apple Strudel Alibi certainly fits the bill.  I highly recommend this book and all of the books in the Oxford Tearoom Mysteries -- they are truly a delight.

31350,4133,3114,"Each time I start reading a book from The Illuminae Files, my initial thought is that Im not going to like it.  I always worry that Ill find the books structure to be gimmicky and that it will distract me from what is actually taking place in the story.  And each time Ive been dead wrong.  I love everything about this series and not only does the books structure not distract from the story, but it actually enhances it and makes it feel all the more authentic, like you really are sitting there reading a case file about an incident aboard a space station.

When Gemina opens, we meet our two new main characters, Hanna and Nik, polar opposites with seemingly nothing in common aside from the fact that they both live on Jump Station Heimdall.  Hanna is the pampered daughter of the ships captain, while Nik is a member of a prominent crime family.  Although they have nothing in common, one view Nik and Hanna share is that they are on the most boring space station in the universe.  But all that is about to change Heimdall is the station Kady Grant and whats left of the Hypatia crew are fleeing to after the events of Illuminae, the first book in the series. The Hypatia is trying to get news of an invasion that killed most of the residents on the planet Kerenza, including proof about who was behind the invasion.

Once we meet Hanna and Nik, its off to the races on a heart-pounding adventure as those responsible for the deadly invasion have dispatched an elite strike team to attack Heimdall.  Their mission:  to ambush and destroy the Hypatia, thereby destroying all evidence of their murderous actions on Kerenza.  Once they get aboard Heimdall, they immediately round up all of the stations residents and lie in wait for the Hypatia.  Guess who they missed though?  You guessed it, Hanna and Nik.  The burden of saving their station, the Hypatia, and possibly the known universe falls on the shoulders of these two young people.  Nothing like a race against the clock to help two people bond

Oh and did I mention the snake-like alien predators that have somehow gotten loose aboard the station who are picking off residents one by one?  No?  Well, yes, as if they didn't have enough to contend with, theres that too. So needless to say, Gemina is an action-packed, thrill ride full of danger and suspense and I thought it was absolutely brilliant!  4.5 STARS",1521676800,5,time start read book illumina file initi thought im go like alway worri ill find book structur gimmicki distract actual take place stori time ive dead wrong love everyth seri book structur distract stori actual enhanc make feel authent like realli sit read case file incid aboard space station gemina open meet two new main charact hanna nik polar opposit seemingli noth common asid fact live jump station heimdal hanna pamper daughter ship captain nik member promin crime famili although noth common one view nik hanna share bore space station univers chang heimdal station kadi grant what left hypatia crew flee event illumina first book seri hypatia tri get news invas kill resid planet kerenza includ proof behind invas meet hanna nik race heartpound adventur respons deadli invas dispatch elit strike team attack heimdal mission ambush destroy hypatia therebi destroy evid murder action kerenza get aboard heimdal immedi round
31351,1980,3822,"I have always thought the Donner Party story was interesting so I thought a book about it that throws in some supernatural elements would be pretty cool, I was wrong.

It's told in third person but we get multiple points of views of several of those on the wagon trail. It was slow going but I was okay with that as I figured it would take a bit of build up to get to the good stuff. There are some parts that are letters or flashbacks to before certain characters decided to sign up for the party going to California. Gives you some background information on the characters.

I really don't know what to say about this story except it was so boring. It's about a piece of history and the author took a lot of liberties with it to make it into the story she wanted. Not to far into it a boy went missing and they found him malled and they thought it was wolves but then the more they are on the trail other things happen. We learn bits from the flashbacks or letters about certain things. Bryant is a guy who is interested in Indian stories and he comes across some strange stories about Na'at's and the Anawai who might have been cannibals then there was something about creatures.

Sounded like that would be really interesting except we verily get any of the stuff that sounded cool. I felt like the story travel about as fast as the wagon party itself. I knew it was about them trekking across the plains but I thought there was going to be a lot more cool stuff to break up the monotonous of the slow trail plotline.

Because Tamsen Donner used herbs a lot of them thought she was a witch, then when things go wrong it was easy to blame her for them. She of course had nothing to do with it. Her daughter heard dead people. I liked Charles Stanton and Mary Graves the best out of the characters. Staton would have been better off if he would have left the group and went on on his own. He was a very brave person in the story and in real life.

By the end I was ready to just skim through and find out what was going to happen to everyone. I had looked up the Donner Party so I knew who died and who lived and how they were rescued and it was interesting to see the different ways the author decided to kill off certain characters but really I just wanted it over.

I do have to admire the bravery of those who blazed a trail across the wild west in search of gold and a new life. It had to be really courageous to pack up your family and hope you bring enough food to feed your family and hope you all make it there alive. I guess I was just hoping for more horror and supernatural element and I didn't get it so I was unsatisfied with this read.",1521676800,1,alway thought donner parti stori interest thought book throw supernatur element would pretti cool wrong told third person get multipl point view sever wagon trail slow go okay figur would take bit build get good stuff part letter flashback certain charact decid sign parti go california give background inform charact realli dont know say stori except bore piec histori author took lot liberti make stori want far boy went miss found mall thought wolv trail thing happen learn bit flashback letter certain thing bryant guy interest indian stori come across strang stori naat anawai might cannib someth creatur sound like would realli interest except verili get stuff sound cool felt like stori travel fast wagon parti knew trek across plain thought go lot cool stuff break monoton slow trail plotlin tamsen donner use herb lot thought

Hanna, the daughter of the station captain, has little to look forward to on Jump Station Heimdall so the upcoming celebration for Terra Day is an event she has been eagerly anticipating. Before she can join the festivities she makes a pitstop to pick up some party favors for her friends from Nik, a member of a notorious crime family living on Heimdall. Little do Hanna and Nik know that their meeting saved their lives when a BeiTech assault team invades the station to prevent the arrival of Kady Grant and the Hypatia. Now Hanna and Nik must work together to evade the BeiTech forces while looking for a way to save everyone on Heimdall along with everyone aboard the Hypatia.

Hanna is initially presented as the spoiled daughter of the station captain who doesnt have a care in the world. Over time we learn theres much more to Hanna than she presents to the world. Her fathers idea of fun was for the two of them to play war strategy games and as a result Hanna is quite skilled in the art of war. Nik is presented as the nephew of Heimdalls crime lord who has a reputation for being able to get anything you want. Despite coming from opposing sides of the social spectrum, Hanna and Nik have a good friendship that at times is full of banter and flirting. The two work well together in the fight against BeiTech and I enjoyed how much others would underestimate Hanna.

My favorite new character introduced is without a doubt Ella, Niks cousin and hacker extraordinaire. We also see the return of some of the characters that survived Illuminae and it was great to see them again and to learn how they fit into this storyline. In Gemina we start to learn more about the motives of BeiTech and just how far those in charge will go to cover up their agenda. The BeiTech assault team that arrives on Heimdall definitely ups the suspense factor a bit compared to Illuminae as now the enemy is in the same place as our characters while previously they were more off-page. Several of the events that occur on Heimdall surprised me in their outcomes which was a nice change from a lot of books that tend to go the easier route.

The unique format of this book is by far one of my favorite aspects of this series. Having the story be told through a series of documents is something I had never encountered prior to reading Illuminae. At times throughout the story you have to turn the book itself in order to read it which definitely makes for a different reading experience. There were a few sections that were difficult to read, in particular the whisperNET IM logs as those are on a gray background with black text. Those sections did slow me down a bit as I had to read them more carefully as I had difficulty seeing the text.

I enjoyed Gemina almost as much as Illuminae and Im highly anticipating picking up the final book Obsidio. Gemina does get off to a somewhat slower start than Illuminae but once the action picks up it never slows down. I highly recommend this series for anyone looking for a unique sci-fi series.",1521676800,5,45 star gemina fantast continu illumina file intrigu storylin charact new old cant help root hanna daughter station captain littl look forward jump station heimdal upcom celebr terra day event eagerli anticip join festiv make pitstop pick parti favor friend nik member notori crime famili live heimdal littl hanna nik know meet save live beitech assault team invad station prevent arriv kadi grant hypatia hanna nik must work togeth evad beitech forc look way save everyon heimdal along everyon aboard hypatia hanna initi present spoil daughter station captain doesnt care world time learn there much hanna present world father idea fun two play war strategi game result hanna quit skill art war nik present nephew heimdal crime lord reput abl get anyth want despit come oppos side social spectrum hanna nik good friendship time full banter flirt two work well togeth fight beitech enjoy much other would underestim hanna favorit new charact introduc without doubt ella nik cousin hacker extraordinair also see return

How Cameron and Tanya, his sister, find their lives forever changed in ever increasing ways after Cameron's quadriplegia all of a sudden disappears.  Several books have been issued regarding the backlash of the current wars and their effect on the American population, but by choosing Biloxi as his location, Miles opens the possibility for a large cast surrounding the central issue, and it is these characterizations that propel this book out of the ordinary.  Some are downright hilarious (Virgil Poleman, you have to discover for yourself why even his name is funny), but there are others imbued with such humanity that they could foster entire narratives (for example, Quynh, the proprietor of the Biz-E-Bee, formerly of Vietnam who finds an opportunity thanks to the fortunate location of where Cameron experiences his miracle).  Miles's style is confident and clear, as seems true of most novelists who have a journalistic background.  But as with Ace in the Hole, a '50's movie in which an event triggers opportunities in others to pursue their own agendas, others make use of Cameron's miracle for motivations not always to his benefit.

MY RATING  
PUBLISHER Highbridge
PUBLISHED June 6, 2017
NARRATED  Corrie James

An complex but emotionally rewarding story of two women centuries apart who sacrificed much by choosing a passion of the mind over the heart.

SUMMARY
Two women of remarkable intellect are the subject of this monumental and award winning novel set in London in the 1660s and early 21st-century. Helen Watt, is an ailing historian with the love of Jewish history, right on the verge of retirement. She has just been called to the home of a former student to review a cache of 17th century Jewish documents, discovered during his home renovations. Helen, with the help of Aaron Levy, an embittered and unsympathetic American graduate student, soon realize they have uncovered something stunning.  They are in a quest to unlock the secrets of the documents, the identity of the documents scribe, and the meaning of their own lives.

Ester Velasquez, a bright, young immigrant from Amsterdam tirelessly scribes for an aging blind rabbi, despite prohibitions against her doing so.  As a result of her work, she learns much from the Rabbi.  Her mind is opened to new ideas and self discovery, and she soon longs to do so much more. Despite offers of marriage, Ester staunchly chooses her scholarly work, and she further desires to engage with the brilliant minds of her day, particularly the controversial Dutch philosopher Benedictus de Spinoza. Esters story illuminates the standing of Jews in London, the plague (1665) and the Great Fire of London (1666)

REVIEW
The Weight of Ink is a deftly woven epic story of self-discovery of two women.  Ester is in the beginning of her adult life and looking forward, and Helen is completing her career, looking backwards over her life.  Both women compellingly chose to focus their lives on scholarly work over love in spite of traditional roles for women. Two true Bluestocking women! Poignant, moving and thought-provoking, this book will draw you in like a moth to a flame, and leave you amazed. This is undoubtably one of the best books I have read in 2018.

Rachel Kadishs writing is masterful and absorbing.  She effortlessly transports us back and forward across the centuries, with memorable characters that keep you grounded and propel the story.  With close to 600 pages or 23 listening hours, this is by no means a light or quick read, but it is well beyond satisfying. In January 2018, The Weight of Ink was named a winner of a 2017 National Jewish Book Award  The Audible version of this book narrated by Corrie James was performed with perfection.

Love must be, then, and act of truth-telling, a baring of mind and spirit just as ardent as the baring of the body. Truth and passion were one, and each  impossible without the other.

31361,4120,1952,"Whoever said every biographer falls in love with his subject must have seen Ron Chernow coming. His effusive and glowing life of our 18th president's career(s) is so gushing, so emphatically positive and so one-sided as to resemble a school-boy crush. I'm surprised there aren't better editors at Penguin. Grant could easily be trimmed by 100-150 pages with repetition substituting for nuance.  As with Hamilton, the latest beneficiary of Chernow's attention is 1) underappreciated and neglected  2) misunderstood or unfairly criticized 3) self-destructive or fatally flawed (yet still deserving of heartfelt thanks from a grateful nation) and 4) denigrated by less perceptive historians.  It's a winning formula that makes for a great read--hagiography is less demanding than moral complexity. It also gives the reader a pat on the head for participating in the subject's ""rehabilitation"".  Bolstered by Chernow's exemplary if purplish prose it's easy to see why the author is popular.  My problem with Grant is I don't agree with the premises that serve as the book's foundation.

If Grant was ever neglected (a debatable claim) it certainly isn't in the 21st century. Over the last 10 years, there have been at least five major biographies or assessments of his career and important.  The ""rehab"" of US Grant was in full swing long before Chernow hopped on the bandwagon. The author is very much a Ronny-Come-Lately.  The far more insightful (and concise) American Ulysses by Ronald White is a stellar example of the appreciation Chernow claims is lacking.  Further, these other works are a good deal more nuanced.  Chernow is right to emphasize the genetic component of Grant's alcoholism and depression. It is a testament to his strength of character that Grant overcame these obstacles to succeed at the very high levels he did.  It was and is though not wrong of detractors to point out (even emphasize) his shortcomings.  The commander of Union forces should be sober and not on a bender.  The President of the United States needs to be able to get out of bed in the morning. Grant's success militarily can be attributed as much to the miserable state of Union leadership. Though his abilities were formidable and his tactics groundbreaking he might never have had a chance had there not been so many Union mediocrities. Under anything approaching normal conditions (i.e., officers willing and/or knowing how to fight), Grant's behavior probably would not have been tolerated.

There is little consideration too of Grant's infamous General Order 11 which blamed Jews for profiteering during the war and expelled them from his theater of command. Even taking into account (which Chernow doesn't) 19th-century sensibilities, it is shockingly Anti-Semitic and positively medieval. The fact that it was so wholly out of character for a man of integrity and decency has intrigued historians for generations. Not Chernow though who gives it short shrift.  A more nuanced narrative might have tried to provide context or considered it an aberration--all men do shameful things. Those of character take responsibility for their bad behavior and make amends--which U.S. Grant did assiduously for the remainder of his llife. To his credit, he was forever ashamed of the order and proud of his ability to convince many (though not all) in the American Jewish community it was not representative of his beliefs.

Grant was also fortunate. The president who follows Andrew Johnson is bound to look good by comparison. The public need not feel gratitude their chief executive isn't impeachable.  That should be a given. Chernow is equally too forgiving of Grant's poor judgment during his presidency. Over and over and over we are reminded Grant was an honest man who never personally benefited from the rampant corruption in his administration. Agreed. Even in these degraded political times, personal integrity, however, is the bare minimum we should expect from public officials.  The fact that he did not personally benefit does not excuse his poor judgment in setting the foxes loose among the chickens. His terrible judgment of other peoples' character was not just a personal disaster, but a public one too that diminished trust in government and institutions.  However well-intended he might have been, his reputation rightly took a hit, moving him down from the first rank of presidents. Because it is tragic, does not make it undeserved.  A more nuanced portrayal would have been appreciated.

Grant is admirable in some very important ways even the author's gushing prose can't do justice. The president's treatment of and appreciation for the slaves he had so doggedly helped to free is a model of decency and character.  His absolute determination to destroy the Ku Klux Klan and see Reconstruction through has been noted by others but Chernow is right to trumpet and spotlight the cause as a model achievement.  Sadly, those who followed in the office lacked his determination and his commitment to the rule of law. The result was another century of racial intolerance and bigotry.  I also found myself succumbing to the relentless sentimental tug of Grant's operatic narrative. His one last great failure of judgment resulted in financial ruin threatening his beloved wife with a life of penury after his death.  Stricken with cancer,  Grant struggled heroically to complete his memoirs, willing his memory and his pen to provide her the security his judgment had failed to secure.  It was the last heroic act of an admirable and courageous man.

31362,3744,1952,"Chernow writes so well about fabulously interesting people that he has researched so well that his books, despite their length, are simply fabulous reads.  Here he has done much to reverse the commonly held notions that Grant was a drunken fool, poor military commander who only won by virtue of overwhelming resources, and corrupt and venal President.  Instead Grant is presented as a truly great military commander and one of the very best Presidents ever, whose principal weakness was his poor choice of friends and associates who used him unmercifully.  Chernow's discussion of Reconstruction and Grant's attempts to bring the freed slaves into full blown citizenship is fabulous and I particularly recommend this book to anyone who still has doubts about the whole point of tearing down statues of Confederate leaders.",1521676800,4,chernow write well fabul interest peopl research well book despit length simpli fabul read done much revers commonli held notion grant drunken fool poor militari command virtu overwhelm resourc corrupt venal presid instead grant present truli great militari command one best presid ever whose princip weak poor choic friend associ use unmerci chernow discus reconstruct grant attempt bring freed slave full blown citizenship fabul particularli recommend book anyon still doubt whole point tear statu confeder leader

31364,981,3823,"Lake Silence was surprisingly good. Not that I didn't think Anne Bishop could write another great book. But I was surprised how much I liked it after spending 5 books with other characters and then completely shifting to an entirely new cast. The reason was that everything felt familiar if slightly different, like a trip to your favorite store in a different state.

Vicky is working on bringing a run down resort next to the wild back into being a viable business. It was the only thing she got out of the mess of a marriage she used to be in and she is beyond determined to make it work. The only problem is the girl heating up an eyeball in the microwave and the dead body it came from. Now there are all kinds of people in town asking questions and some are trying to push Vicky of the cottages so they can move their own people in.

As is usual for the Others series this involves a few good Humans, lot of bad ones and The Others who will need to remind the bad humans again that they are not the top predators of the land.

I liked spreading out into this world to meet a few new characters and some new Others as well. Vicky is broken in a lot of ways but it is great to see her be brave, to protect those around her and to try and reforge her life. She has been told for so long that she is worthless and ugly that she has believed it and I like that part of her isn't fixed all at once but is a gradual transition as she becomes more confident in herself.

The other main human players are Julian and intuit that runs the bookstore in town and Grimshaw the loner good cop that gets pulled into the murder mess and is trying to make sure no one takes advantage of the sleepy little town so close to the wild. I appreciated that Julians character is a mirror to Vickys in some ways. She is scarred on the inside and Julian is scarred on the outside.

  Then Julian stepped forward and looked at Vicki. We are among friends who don't judge us by how we look but by who we are, right? He didn't wait for an answer. He shrugged out of the shirt, tossed it toward blankets spread out on the sand, and walked into the waterknees, thighs, waist. Then he dove under.

Both of them have their own demons to conquer from their pasts and they have a good friendship that Im hoping with grow into more with some time to heal. Julian being and intuit should help that, he seems to know just how far Vicky is ready to go right now and he seems like a patient man who will wait for the right time.

The Others of this area were pretty cool, the Lady of the Lake especially and I loved how she was described. Of coarse the members of the Crowguard were fantastic as per usual and just as much help getting into trouble as out of it. The fire elemental we meet is also a very cool addition to the story and a reminder why we should always play nice with the elementals. The Sproingers (in my head they are like a smaller fluffier kangaroo) were adorable and I loved how they are probably the gossipmongers of the sleepy little town and have their paws on the pulse of everything.

There are a few references to the characters we know from the first five books of the series but not direct contact in the story. I miss Meg, Simon and Sam so hopefully we see them again in some other books of the series. This is not a story you can go into without spending some time in this world even thought the character list is new. This is definitely a continuation of the prior books and should be read in order for the more enjoyment of it.",1521676800,4,lake silenc surprisingli good didnt think ann bishop could write anoth great book surpris much like spend 5 book charact complet shift entir new cast reason everyth felt familiar slightli differ like trip favorit store differ state vicki work bring run resort next wild back viabl busi thing got mess marriag use beyond determin make work problem girl heat eyebal microwav dead bodi came kind peopl town ask question tri push vicki cottag move peopl usual other seri involv good human lot bad one other need remind bad human top predat land like spread world meet new charact new other well vicki broken lot way great see brave protect around tri reforg life told long worthless ugli believ like part isnt fix gradual transit becom confid main human player julian intuit run

31367,1948,1281,"What an interesting memoir about a life outside of mainstream society.  Tara Westover was born in 1986, but at times, reading her memoir felt as if it was set decades earlier.
Raised by a radical Mormon father and subservient mother, Tara and her siblings were not sent to school or doctors.

As Tara grows up, she begins to become more enlightened to the circumstances of her family life.  Not getting a birth certificate until age nine and having no formal education until age seventeen, definitely set Tara apart from her peers.

What is outstanding is that up until she entered college, Tara was more or less self taught.  It is impressive that three children out of the family went on to earn a Phd.

Education aside, there were many other disturbing aspects about the family.  Abuse, suffered at the hands of an older brother, was overlooked.  Safety precautions in the family business were nonexistent, resulting in some devastating injuries that the family chose to treat at home, rather than go to a hospital.

Not surprising that today Tara has no contact with at least half of her family.  Any of the siblings that are dependent on income from the family business are estranged from Tara.  I think it was easy to freeze Tara out of the family both because she was female and because she was self-sufficient.

As I finished the book, I wondered why Tara would ever care to reconnect with her parents and certain siblings at all.  There was so much toxic behavior within the family, I would think it would be insane to be in the same room with them ever again.

31371,615,3652,"I have to admit right up front that I am a forever fan of Susan Meissner's novels. I've read nearly all of her historical fiction and have purchased the few I haven't yet read to read as soon as I can. I feel so lucky that I've gotten to be a part of her street teams in the past and that she was kind enough to offer me a copy of her newest novel, As Bright as Heaven, to read. My answer...YES PLEASE!! This newest venture moves away from her typical format in that it keeps the reader solely in the past (many of her other novels have both historical and contemporary timelines) and I, for one, loved being transported to Philadelphia in 1918 and shortly thereafter and being completely immersed in the heartache and hope of the Bright family and the country at large.

The story opens up with the Bright family moving to Philadelphia after a devastating tragedy. Pauline's husband has been given the opportunity to apprentice in and someday take over his uncle's funeral parlor. It's a wonderful opportunity for the whole family, not only because of it's greater opportunities financially but for Pauline to explore the new companion - death - that seems to be shadowing her since the tragedy. However, as the family begins settling in to this new life, two overwhelming world events barge in to turn everything on its head - WWI and the Spanish Flu epidemic.

As Pauline's husband goes off to do his part for the war, along with a neighbor who has become a big part of their life, Pauline and the girls are forced to take over a larger part in the funeral home and within the city dying before their eyes. It is during this time that choices are made that will have devastating and lasting effects on all of their lives and that will shape the course of their lives forever.

I was amazed at how well Meissner brought the devastation of the Spanish Flu to life within these pages and just have heartbreaking and widespread it was! Having the Bright family run a funeral home was the best possible way to show this as they would (and did) have bodies literally stacking up at their door. It's terrifying and claustrophobia-inducing as the various characters don't want to step outside without a mask for fear they will be struck ill. Meissner further drove the point home by developing these characters - both primary and secondary - so well and then having them swept away by the flu right before our eyes. It broke my heart to come to care for some of these characters and then to see them gone in an instant without any rhyme or reason. It truly was heartbreaking but also made the aftermath and growth of the remaining characters so much more compelling.

While definitely taking a backseat to the Spanish Flu the time and detail given to the men who went off to WWI and the PTSD issues many had when they returned was also well done, mainly shown through the neighbor. I can't say too much about this as it leads to other developments later in the story, but I will say that it not only scared these men - both physically and mentally - but took them away from their loved ones, robbing them of being able to say goodbye to those killed during the flu epidemic. I would never have thought of this aspect of what the war robbed these men of and really appreciated getting to see it from this angle.

I am being purposely vague about the rest of the story because I don't want to spoil anything. However, I will say that I appreciated seeing how the Bright daughters were effected by their experiences during this time and how it shaped them into the young women they became. I came to really care for two of them (one ended up somewhat self-centered and unfortunately got on my nerves a little) and admired the choices they made, even if some of them were somewhat questionable choices. These are strong female characters who stood by their actions and I, for one, love that.

31376,1440,1281,"I'm not sure it would be fair to say I ""loved"" this book (which is what Amazon says a five star rating means), but I was completely gripped by it. It's the memoir of a woman who grows up in extraordinary circumstances and finds her own feet in the world, albeit at the cost of her relationship with several members of her family. It's compulsively, viscerally readable - a story that horrified, saddened, angered and moved me.

Tara is the youngest of seven children. She grows up in an isolated part of Idaho. Her parents are Mormons, but they have many extreme views that are not commonly associated with the Mormon faith. They distrust the Government to the extent that they don't register the births of their children (Tara doesn't know exactly when she was born). They reject the public education system and leave it to their children to educate themselves with a few battered and old textbooks. They don't believe in doctors and believe that even the most severe injuries can be cured with herbs and natural concoctions. They do believe that the End of Days is imminent and that it is necessary to be fully prepared to live self-sufficiently.

Tara's father is a controlling, unstable man. Reading this book reminded me of ""My Absolute Darling"" or ""The Marsh King's Daughter"", but those books were fictional and this one is a true story. I couldn't believe how many times he put his family at risk, how he ignored events that didn't sit with his world view, how he used bullying tactics to keep his family in line. One of Tara's brothers is also unstable and violent and some of the descriptions of his behaviour are nearly unbearable to read. I am simply in awe of the way she - and some of her siblings - were able to create the lives that they have now.

His Risk by Shelley Shepard Gray have more than just one man's risk to contend with. Readers need to risk their hearts and sleep to read this one! *Sigh, my heart still is a bit sad after one twist. I kept thinking there will be another twist to ""untwist"" the first one. You know what I mean? Probably not, but without giving away too much, let's just say it surprised me how much I've fallen for all the characters in this installment of The Amish of Hart County.

""Life is full of unexpected twists and turns and bumps and disappointments. . .there's so much that isn't good that isn't our fault that we have to put up with, sometimes I think it's hard to believe that anything good can happen. But when it does, it's worth grabbing a hold of.""

And grab hold, I tell you of His Risk and the rest of this series. There's romance, friendship, family, but also a thread of mystery and suspense that have you curling your toes. I for one really enjoyed getting to know Calvin more. He made a appearance in His Guilt, but to see him in his own story had me loving it. His tough and handsome exterior doesn't match the good and the self-doubt persona he is. There's a lot of growth and development readers will get to experience with him, along with a little backstory of his childhood with his brother and his friendship with West. Speaking of West, I didn't know what to make out of this guy, but his parts with Irene was just wonderful. I really enjoyed the secondary romance we get to read about along with Calvin and Alice's story.

In all, His Risk is compelling, suspenseful and filled with a faith message that touches all the hard issues of life. A story to read and find the sprout of hope and healing within the pages. To end, one of my favorite lines that gives light to some of the darkness.
""'You made everything seem better. . . kind of like this morning's sunrise. . .' '. . .the sun hasn't risen yet.' 'I know. But the hint of it is there.  Some mornings that's enough, ain't so?'""

Instead, he believes Casey was set up and helps her prove it, aiding her along the way. Casey comes to look for God being at work and finds lots to be thankful for even as she is on the run. Dylan keeps trusting in Romans 8:28 which says all things work together for good to them who love God and are called according to his purpose.

I loved the twists in this novel. When I first started this novel, I was questioning whether this book was for me as it seemed jumpy but things soon settled down.  I had many questions as I read this novel, it was one of those novels that pushed me the more that I read.  Individuals were trying to be devious and cunning and they were doing an excellent job of it yet I began to wonder who exactly is doing the scheming?

Polly had a history. She has just walked out on her husband and her three-year-old daughter, history seems to be repeating itself.  How Polly can leave her children behind baffles me and I needed to learn more about Polly to understand her motives.  Polly arrives in a small town and she begins to build a life there yet I have a feeling, she won't be staying long.  Adam, pops up on the scene and Polly notices him but after what she just did to husband #2, she notices him but there isn't that instant romance a guy like him would provoke. Adam knows about Pollys past and has followed her to this town, in his truck.

Now that we got individuals where they belong and we got some history, I couldn't put the book down as things inside this novel started to get interesting.  I liked how Polly got comfortable in her new surroundings.  The small town welcomed her, Adam seemed to be making his own life in this town too and Polly found a job at the High-Ho Bar which led to some exciting adventures.  I learned about her past and although I didn't want to cast Polly in a negative light, her past was awful dark.  The ending really surprised me and I really enjoyed it.

I was lucky enough to get this wonderful book in my Owlcrate subscription for March.

I loved this book so very much. I love space opera's and this one is awesome.

I love all of the characters from the space crew. Not so much anyone from the space station but Robb.

There are 4 POV's in the book: Ana, DO9, Robb and Jax. This doesn't make it confusing at all either. And of course I love these 4 main characters. I love them to bits.

Ana and DO9 are best friends but there are a few more feelings going on, well the android (DO9) can't feel or can he? Then Robb and Jax have this like/hate thing going on. Most everyone does with Robb at first because he's and Ironblood, he's royalty. But Robb is not like his family and he's trying to find his father and gets thrown in with Ana, DO9 and Jax who are on the same mission to a lost ship.

The whole crew and the new friends find out they all have to stick together to help save each other from Robb's evil mother and other things that are going on. Yes, there are some deaths but that is to be expected.

I'm just so happy that I loved this book as much as I did. I had a feeling I would from the summary. I would recommend to people that enjoy YA Sci-Fi type books.

Happy Reading!

31393,741,3905,"The Wild Inside by Jamey Bradbury is a so-so debut horror/rural noir novel set in Alaska.

Tracy Petrikoff, seventeen, has been raised hunting and trapping, as well as caring for the family's sled dogs, in Alaska. She runs wild in the wilderness and gets her strength from it. It has been nearly two years since her mother's death, and her father, Bill, is still recovering from her death. Now she has been expelled from school, her father is trying to load her up with chores and limit her time trapping and running through the woods. Tracy wants to enter her first adult Iditarod, but her father isn't listening to her. He was a champion musher, but has essentially retired now.

When Tracy goes out to check her traps, a stranger attacks her and knocks her unconscious. She comes to with her bloody knife lying nearby. The next day a man emerges from the woods onto their property with a deadly knife wound. Did Tracy inflict the wound with the hunting knife she always carries? She can't remember, but he seems to be familiar. Tracy keeps all her thoughts to herself and doesn't tell her father what happened.

Positives about the novel were the beautiful descriptions of Alaska. This book evoked a rollercoaster of emotions for me, however many of them were not positive. There is one thing Tracy does, aside from her horrible grammar, which made the book almost a ""did not finish,"" something I don't do lightly. Tracy's bad grammar will grate on many readers nerves after a while in this first-person narrator; it's just a fact. Tracy is feral in many ways. The one activity that Tracy does, which I won't describe, is disturbing. There is a description/revelation of it that happens early in the book, which really cemented my averse reaction to Tracy as a character. Sometimes something is simply too weird for some readers. Take note that there is no mention of any supernatural elements in the description, which would have steered me away from this book.

31396,1440,2605,"Two things struck me about this book. The first was how immensely readable it is. The new translation by Emily Wilson is brilliant. Reading the translator's note only added to my admiration for the way that she has retained the natural rhythm and original intention of the text while making it so easy to read.

The second thing that struck me is how little it resembled the story of the Odyssey that I thought I knew. By this I mean that I always thought the book was mostly about Odysseus's travels around the Mediterranean, and his encounters with Circe, Cyclops, the Sirens, Scylla etc. In fact, this is only a very small part - maybe a quarter? - of the book. It is mostly about his return to Ithaca and how his wife and son have managed in his absence.

And the ending reads like a Lee Child book! We are warned, ""there will be blood"", and blood there is. ""Playtime is over"", Odysseus declares, and then he singlehandedly massacres a roomful of his wife's suitors.

I was also surprised by how little I liked Odysseus, who seems often to lie for no other purpose than because he thinks that makes him wily, who displays no compassion for anyone who suffers around him, and who cries at the drop of a hat when things don't go his way.

I will tell you this book is not for every reader which I can totally understand why some readers didn't like it and that is totally ok because I love seeing different opinions in reviews as well. But I absolutely love and enjoy this book so much I don't want to go into any details about The Chalk Man because I don't want to be too a spoiler. But this book I mean This Freaking Book yall wow, wow, wow, I absolutely love thrillers book and The Chalk Man was so much more than a thriller book. From the prologue at the very beginning intraps you and get you thinking about what it is going on. This book has alternate timelines one set in the past of 1986 to 2016 30 years later around Eddie Addams and his friends, which I will tell you that Eddie and his friends to me were unlikable characters I really didn't connect to them or even like any of them especially I didn't like Eddie. I really can't explain why I didn't like or connect with any of these characters it's just I didn't, but that's ok I really don't mind reading unlikable characters because I love reading books with unlikable characters if that makes sense. But this book goes back to the year of 1986 when Eddie and his friend were kids hanging out during the summer and getting ready for the new school year. Now Eddie and his friends do normal kids stuff during the summer and school year when one day Eddie saw a chalk message on the sidewalk what he thought was one of his friend that made it from him, but it was actually a more sinister message that leads Eddie and his group of friends to a body in the woods and  that they were lead there by The Chalk Man. Now while reading The Chalk Man you read from the past 1986 to 30 years later at 2016 I really don't mind the alternate timelines I thought it added more to the plotlines and characters in this amazing book. There are so many dark secrets that Eddie and his friends were keeping from each other and there were so many twists and turns in this book that I so didn't see it coming! Especially that ending OMGosh that ending caught me way off guard I so didn't see it coming I mean it shouldn't have surprised me but it absolutely surprises me at the end.

In Cassandra, Bohjalian has crafted a fine protagonist, a character who has much to come to terms with, and the novel works like a coiled spring.  This element of thrill and mystery was not something I necessarily expected, but was happy to find at work in the book.

Beyond the machinations of the plot, Bohjalian is a writer who knows what he is doing with words.  His sentences bring the plot forward and serve to help us know Cassandra better.  This book is a fine example of the thriller genre, and is literary in quality at the same time.

I'm to go ahead and say I'm in the minority in this opinion, so no need to keep reading if you have flocked with the masses on the novel...I understand. But The Alice Network by Kate Quinn simply fell short for me. I found myself looking to do anything but read - even watch horribly boring car shows my husband likes - to keep this book at bay. I powered through because I needed to find out one thing about a character - and one thing only - and it turns out I could have learned this detail from a much shorter Wikipedia search.

But, before I move into my struggles, let's roll out the basic premise of the novel:

1947- Charlie St. Claire, a college dropout because she's found herself in a family way, returns home her sophomore year. She comes from wealth, so her parents are chauffeuring her off to Switzerland to take care of her ""little problem."" Her father calls her a whore - and she is. She doesn't even know who the father of her child is - states it could be ""any one of six or seven fraternity boys."" She is reeling from the death of her brother who came home from the war a changed man and subsequently ""ate a shotgun."" In her attempt to recover from this loss, she uses sex as a way to make her ""feel something"" again. Additionally, her best friend (and cousin) Rose also disappeared during the war and Charlie believes she's still alive. Her story is basically a cross-country trip trying to find Rose. She is whiny and selfish and petulant. I did not like her, not at all.

1915 - Eve Gardinier, a woman with a stammer that feels invisible to the world, wants desperately to find a way to serve her country. One man, who becomes code name ""Uncle Edouard,"" sees her potential and her cleverness and recruits into a network of female spies that served during WWI. She's multilingual speaking English, German, and French and her speech impediment makes people believe she is ""simple-minded."" This allows her to fly under the radar of most of the time - a quality needed in a good spy. She lands a job at the Le Lethe restaurant that caters to German officers and is able to find out all kinds of information that she passes along to ""powers that be."" She is invaluable and her story is riveting. I loved Eve.

So - that's the story. The novels toggles back and forth between the two women and their paths cross when Charlie finds out that Eve was one of the last people to be a part of a search for what happened to her cousin Rose.

Eve's story is truly gripping and heartbreaking and shockingly amazing and awful all at the same time. She is a woman on mission to serve and gives up so much in the process of doing so. Her character tore me up...what she did, what she experienced, what she sacrificed. Learning about the small details of the spy network through Eve, the notes on rice paper and hair pins, and false bottom bags, and Lugers concealed in the most unusual places, created an entire world in my mind's eye. The danger she and other women of The Alice Network faced in a attempt to blunt the cruelty of the German army is the stuff of legends.

Charlie's story is not gripping. I couldn't stand her. She was foul and dirty and self-involved. Bratty even. Her love for her cousin I guess could be considered admirable but that was about her only redeeming quality. Reading her chapters was mind-numbing and I found myself skimming them a lot just to back to Eve. I was bored by the 1947 ""road trip"" and felt like this book needed a much heavier hand with the editing. Charlie's character was redundant in her obsessive ""I see Rose everywhere I look"" comments and there was simply no depth to her. None.

The novel touches on all facets of war - basically that it is hell not only on those fighting, but those left behind. Each character seems to be suffering from their own form of PTSD, and each of them is dealing with the derelict of psyche in a different way. I think Quinn did admirable research in order to write this book and share Eve's story - but for me, it should have been only Eve's story. Charlie was irrelevant and detracted from the real hero of this book.

I give this book because of the research and the development of Eve - she stole the show, but it is far from my favorite historical fiction novel. If you browse through Goodreads, you'll see I'd be shunned for my opinion, but what I can say - I like what I like, and this wasn't it. Historical fiction should take an event from history and give it life, revitalize it with tenacity and pulse - the inclusion of Charlie's character left this novel cold, and metaphorically dead.

Kate Quinn writes other historical fiction novels - mostly set in Greece and Rome; this seems to be her first foray into American history. I wouldn't count her out as author for me - the writing chops are good, but she needs an editor that understands the meaning of succinct.",1521676800,3,place book hold librari like number 135 35 copi like wow book go ahmaz receiv email say automat download kindl quick like wasnt im go ahead say im minor opinion need keep read flock mass nove understand alic network kate quinn simpli fell short found look anyth read even watch horribl bore car show husband like keep book bay power need find one thing charact one thing turn could learn detail much shorter wikipedia search move struggl let roll basic premis novel 1947 charli st clair colleg dropout she found famili way return home sophomor year come wealth parent chauffeur switzerland take care littl problem father call whore doesnt even know father child state could one six seven fratern boy reel death brother came home war chang man subsequ ate shotgun attempt recov loss use sex way make feel someth addit best friend cousin rose also disappear war charli believ
31405,1112,763,"Fans of the writing style and subject matter of Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn should be excited to read this latest offering in the Gray Man series from author Mark Greaney. Court Gentry, the worlds deadliest assassin,(think a combination of Mitch Rapp, Jason Bourne and Ethan Hunt  on steroids) is back in the employ of the CIA after five years of freelancing as a professional gun for hire.  Removed from their burn list and welcomed back into the fold by his former employer, Gentrys current CIA assignment is to capture a rogue hacker named Fan Jiang who had been working for the Chinese military before he bolted for parts unknown.

GUNMETAL GRAY is, among other things, a mini tour of Eastern Asia with our chief protagonist ping-ponging between China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand as he outruns everyone from Chinese and Russian agents to Vietnamese gangsters while chalking up an impressive body count.  Of course, as with every against-all-odds super warrior with a moral code, there must be a love interest (this time in the person of Zoya Zakharova, the Russian operative whose prowess in all things adversarial is reminiscent of the exploits of Lara Croft)

In fact, it would have worked just as well without the ghost parts, but it does add a creepiness to the storyline that might not have been there otherwise. Its set in small-town Vermont, where a girls boarding school has sat empty for decades. Journalist Fiona Sheridan is somewhat obsessed with its locale, as this is where her sisters murdered body was dumped 20 years ago. Fiona was 17 at the time, and the murder tore her family apart and seems to have kept her in limbo ever since, even though her sisters boyfriend was tried and convicted of the murder. She keeps her police officer boyfriend at arms length, and when she learns that someone is renovating the old school she thinks it would be a good idea for her to investigate and write a story about it. Flashing back and forth between this timeline and the 1950s, we learn that the girls at the school were all afraid of the ghost of Mary Hand, and that one of them, Sophia, is about to be murdered as well.

31419,901,3894,"The mysteries of Flaxborough are meant to be savored, relished for their very British drollery. The wit can sometimes be lost on what passes for American sensibilities (or the lack thereof); this can easily be overcome with moments of clarifying rumination.

HOPJOY WAS HERE, the third book in the series, starts out with more grue than does its two predecessors. Inspector Purbright is sent on a merry chase, looking for not only a killer, but the dead body as well. Clues abound, perhaps too many, and there is the added burden of the men from London.

All in all, HOPJOY WAS HERE provides a convoluted romp of a mystery that covers a lot of territory in Flaxborough, any number of interesting citizens, and proves to be a tantalizing read from beginning to end.

Readers Beware the torture is descriptive and goes on way to long before Zara is Rescued by GhostWalker Team 4. It took me over a day just to get past the descriptions of the torture Zara was enduring. It was way to much for me and way to descriptive. But once I got past that part of the storyline the rest was a good mix of action and a growing love relationship between Zara and Gino. Gino Mazza is your typical Alpha Male. I loved the way he loved Zara and her acceptance of his dominate personality. Gino was dominate but not dominating. Of course they have a pretty hot sensual relationship. But surprisingly not as sensual as most of Christine Feehan's books. This was a bit toned down in my opinion. Zara has a unique GW ability she can communicate with computers and she store there information and files in her brain, just like she is computer herself. This was really interesting to read and I hope CF expands on AI intelligence in future GW stories.

The triplets Ginger, Cannalle and Thym are mentioned through out the story, but there is no real interaction of banter with them. I Loved there antics in the other GW stories. I love Nonny and those triplet babies. So I missed there presence in this story and hope they get there usual spot in the next GW book. Nonny of course was there to give her advice to her new girl Zara. There girls night out was a pleasant surprise to the story.

If an CF wants to write descriptive torture scenes then I wish she had written Gino's torture of Bolan Zhu instead Zara's torture by Bolan Zhu.

It was scary to see how easy someone can prey on someone so young and vulnerable. It was also so easy to see how a young adolescent would fall for it.

Lou has tried to get on with her life but has struggled to form any lasting relationships with a man due to what happened in her past. Returning to her family home has her bringing up a whole load of memories and emotions that she would rather forget.

Mike literally made my skin crawl, the more I read the more I loathed him. I was literally right there beside Lou willing her to put an end to what Mike was doing before he got his grubby hands on another unsuspecting victim.

31434,558,3914,"This is my go-to genre but recently I have been a bit disappointed with the books I have read. So much so that I was toying with the idea of taking a break from them for a while. But, having read and enjoyed all this author's previous books, I though I'd sneak just one more in before I took my break. Boy am I glad I did! This book epitomised everything I want, need and love about a good psychological thriller. Grabbing me from the start, holding on to my attention throughout, and leaving me satisfied at the end.
Set in the present day, with flashback to the past, we follow Lou as she returns to her childhood home to sort out her late father's house. This move back reminds her of a time in her life when she was very unhappy and turned to the affections of one of her teachers. This ""relationship"" culminating in the two of them running away abroad. Her teacher, Mike, is now out of prison and still living in the town and Lou is shocked to say the least when she sees him with a young girl. Knowing what she herself went through, she knows that she much stop this relationship before things get worse. But will anyone believe her? What will it take for her to protect the child and bring the predator to justice once and for all?
I absolutely loved the direction this book took. Unlike a lot of this genre of book, I decided early on that I had no idea where we were going so I just allowed the author to take me on her characters' journeys. I gave up trying to second guess and just went with the flow and I think I had a much better reading experience doing this. And boy was it a thrilling ride!
Characters and indeed character development through the book was absolutely brilliant. I loved the way that several of the characters came of age through the book. I am not just talking about the young characters here either. Even some of the more mature characters have moments of clarity and awakenings throughout the book. The book is told from multiple points of view throughout and we get to see some of these things pretty much first hand. I am not over keen on this method of storytelling as a general rule but, when it is done as well as it has been here, it just makes for a really great read as it fits the plot and its development absolutely perfectly.
Lou's backstory is told in flashback with the salient parts drip fed in exactly the right moments to complement the story as it unfolds in the present. There are certain things that maybe don't quite gel in the present and have to be held into until the appropriate past explanation but this just added to the level of intrigue that the book held me in throughout.
There's also a lot of shocking and rather questionable ""means to an end "" action contained within the book but, to be honest, they are pretty much all justified and had me questioning my own morals a bit throughout. Some of the things that happen to certain characters along the way do seem a little dubious but, when you get to the final chapter, which I loved by the way, you do get the feeling that sometimes it's the only way.
Pacing was absolutely perfect and, despite the underlying theme of child grooming, there were the odd lighter moments that made the book remain balanced. I personally don't like it when a book is too dark but here, the author stays the right side of things throughout. She also treats the subject matter with great respect and has obviously done her research. Yes, there is a lot of really nasty stuff contained within the pages but all included for story telling and plot development rather than shock tactic.
All in all, another really great addition to an already really impressive back catalogue. I really can;t wait to see what the author has in store next time.

31435,620,3914,"Fourteen-year-old Lou loved her karate teacher Mike with all her heart. When he suggested a trip to France she was more than happy to go with him. However, the trip turned into a nightmare and many years later Lou is still having problems because of everything Mike has done to her. She's in her early thirties and is alone because she has relationship issues. When she inherits her father's house and goes back to the area she met Mike, she decides to confront her past. To her disgust she discovers that Mike is grooming another girl. Chloe is thirteen years old and Lou will do everything she can to make sure history won't repeat itself. Unfortunately it isn't easy to get people to listen, how far will Lou be willing to go to make sure Chloe remains safe? Mike is a predator, will she risk her own wellbeing and take the chance she'll be his victim once again?

Wendy is trying to approach Lou, but how can she do that without raising suspicion? She has to be careful if she wants to reach her goal. Because of Lou her whole life changed and there's a lot she holds Lou accountable for. Is this justified? What is the connection between the two women and will meeting Lou give Wendy the answers she needs?

The Fear is a gripping story about a despicable dangerous man and his victims. Mike skillfully grooms teenage girls with problems at home. Lou and Chloe's parents have other things on their minds than the happiness of their children and he uses this to his advantage. I felt sick when I read about his personality, his actions and the methods he uses. C.L. Taylor describes him in a fantastic believable way that makes him come to life almost too well. Mike is clever and cunning, a man to fear. Not knowing what his next move would be kept me on the edge of my seat.

Lou used to be a vulnerable teenager. She's still fragile now that she's older, having plenty of scars from everything that happened between her and Mike. She was too scared to testify and was always afraid he'd come after her. C.L. Taylor writes about her fear in an amazing way, I could really feel it. I could easily imagine why she wanted to save Chloe from a fate similar to her own. Chloe is young and naive. She's being bullied and doesn't have any self confidence. Love is lacking in her life and Mike is more than willing to fill that gap. I couldn't stop reading as I was anxious to find out if Chloe would see his true nature in time. I was also curious to see what Wendy's role would be in the story. She's a complex woman with a personality that has many different layers. I loved how C.L. Taylor alternates between the three equally interesting characters.

C.L. Taylor has written another thought-provoking book. She's an expert when it comes to dividing tension. Her books always surprise me in many different ways. The Fear has plenty of unexpected twists and turns and the ending is absolutely mindblowing. The subject matter of The Fear is disturbing and reading about Mike put tears in my eyes plenty of times. The Fear is an incredibly well written story for readers with a strong stomach.",1521676800,5,fourteenyearold lou love karat teacher mike heart suggest trip franc happi go howev trip turn nightmar mani year later lou still problem everyth mike done she earli thirti alon relationship issu inherit father hous goe back area met mike decid confront past disgust discov mike groom anoth girl chloe thirteen year old lou everyth make sure histori wont repeat unfortun isnt easi get peopl listen far lou will go make sure chloe remain safe mike predat risk wellb take chanc shell victim wendi tri approach lou without rais suspicion care want reach goal lou whole life chang there lot hold lou account justifi connect two woman meet lou give wendi answer need fear grip stori despic danger man victim mike skill groom teenag girl problem home lou chloe parent thing mind happi child use advantag felt sick read person action method use cl taylor describ fantast believ way make come life almost

31443,2527,844,"O.M.G. I could not put this book down. ""Sometimes I Lie"" is a whopper of a psychological thriller from first-time novelist Alice Feeney.

The book starts with Amber Reynolds waking up in a hospital unable to move or even open her eyes. As the reader, we journey with Amber as she struggles to remember how she got there. The book switches among three different perspectives: Amber's thoughts as she lies helpless in the hospital, one week earlier with events leading up to the incident that put her in the hospital, and entries in a childhood diary.

I love novels like this, where the reader is just as lost as the protagonist, figuring out the puzzle along with her. In some novels the other perspectives give the reader a leg up on the protagonist, but not in this case. In this case, we are exactly where Amber is in our level of cluelessness. The childhood diaries appear to give background, but it is unclear to the reader how it fits into the big picture until - BAM! - one sentence about 3/4 of the way into the book shows you exactly how it fits in. Holy moly. It's as if at the start of the book a train is approaching slowly, gaining just a little bit of ground as it gets closer, and it picks up speed as the book moves along, and when that one sentence comes, the train all of a sudden smashes into you when you had no idea it had gotten that close to you. I froze after reading that sentence and flipped back to skim sections I'd already read because I couldn't believe it. I can't say more without spoiling the book.

It's not a spoiler to say that the book has quite a twist (a couple of twists, actually) at the end. I am confident that no reader will be able to anticipate the ending. It was so diabolically good.

It's been a long time since I've been so gobsmacked by a book. Well played, Ms. Feeney. I very much look forward to reading your next novel.",1521676800,5,omg could put book sometim lie whopper psycholog thriller firsttim novelist alic feeney book start amber reynold wake hospit unabl move even open eye reader journey amber struggl rememb got book switch among three differ perspect amber thought lie helpless hospit one week earlier event lead incid put hospit entri childhood diari love novel like reader lost protagonist figur puzzl along novel perspect give reader leg protagonist case case exactli amber level clueless childhood diari appear give background unclear reader fit big pictur bam one sentenc 34 way book show exactli fit holi moli start book train approach slowli gain littl bit ground get closer pick speed book move along one sentenc come train sudden smash idea gotten close froze read sentenc flip back skim section id alreadi read couldnt believ cant say without spoil book spoiler say book quit twist coupl

Way back in the 1970's I read A Wrinkle in Time as an elementary school student in small town Indiana. I was a voracious reader (I won the library's summer reading contest several years in a row - the only thing that ended my reign was moving away) and I remember that I attached great importance to this book. It must have been handed to me by a teacher or a librarian. But, I also remember that I was indifferent to the book itself. My impression of the book was that it was unique but rather vague and cerebral.

With the new movie version coming out, I was inspired to re-read the book. Also, I must admit that I was curious to see if the book affected me any differently more than 40 years later.

This time around I listened to it as an audiobook. Hope Davis read the book and she did a fine job, creating multiple accents and voices and switching back and forth between them with ease. The audiobook also included comments by the director of the new movie (it had to have been just starting to be made when she wrote this introduction on 2012), the author's granddaughter and Madeline L'Engle herself. All three of these commentaries were excellent - for me they were the best part of the audiobook.

And, that is certainly a problem. The text of the book itself should have been the best part of the audiobook, not the comments attached to it. I found the book itself like I found it 40 years ago - rather vague, full of a lot of talking and characters that I just didn't attach myself to. I really like the philosophy behind the book - the ideas that they espouse about fate and faith and our role in the world mirror my own quite a lot. Who knows? Maybe this book really did influence me more than I knew. But, I just found myself rolling my eyes at the stilted dialogue and just about everything Charles Wallace said or did - just like before.

So, how do you rate a book in which you agree with the ideas behind it but can't stand the way the ideas are presented throughout? I'm going to split the difference - 5 stars for the underlying ideas, 1 star for the plot, dialogue, etc. That makes an average of 3 stars.",1521676800,3,origin publish 1962 winner 1963 newberri medal publish listen librari 2012 read hope davi durat 6 hour 26 minut unabridg way back 1970 read wrinkl time elementari school student small town indiana voraci reader librari summer read contest sever year row thing end reign move away rememb attach great import book must hand teacher librarian also rememb indiffer book impress book uniqu rather vagu cerebr new movi version come inspir reread book also must admit curiou see book affect differ 40 year later time around listen audiobook hope davi read book fine job creat multipl accent voic switch back forth ea audiobook also includ comment director new movi start made wrote introduct 2012 author granddaught madelin lengl three commentari excel best part audiobook certainli problem text book best part audiobook comment attach found book like found 40 year ago rather vagu full lot talk charact

David Grann is a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of The Lost City of Z, a best-seller that was translated into more than 25 languages. He won honors for outstanding journalism and a George Polk Award. This 2017 book of 338 pages has a Contents, three Chronicles, 26 chapters, Notes, and a Select Bibliography; there is no Index. The discovery of oil on the Osage Indian nation in 1920's Oklahoma made them the richest people in the world. Then a series of murders began. The FBI began to investigate and used a former Texas Ranger to solve the mystery with an undercover team. Dozens of people were murdered. This book is its history.

The Osage nation had been driven from their lands in Kansas to rocky lands in northeast Oklahoma. When oil was discovered the Osage began to collect millions in royalties (Chapter 1). Mollie Burkhart worried about her sister, missing for three days. Then two bodies were found murdered. The purpose of the allotment system was to end the communal way of life (Chapter 4). The remaining land of the Cherokees was given to white settlers via a land rush in September 1893. Oklahoma means red people in the Choctaw language. The Osage agreement reserved all mineral rights to the Osage Tribe. Then other killings continued (Chapter 5). After at least 24 members of the tribe died a national publication, the Literary Digest, had an article on this (p. 94). The Osage Tribal Council asked for help from the Department of Justice (p. 96).

A team of FBI agents began to investigate, two overtly, more covertly (Chapter 9). Guardians and Administrators to the Osage Indians often swindled them (Chapter 14). They were among the most prominent white citizens! Judges ignored reports of fraud (p. 156)! Probate records shows headrights (to the riches) inherited by Mollie Burkhart, the wife of Hales nephew Ernest (p. 161). Bill Hale controlled politics (Chapter 16). People who could testify against Hale died suddenly (Chapter 17). Was Mollie being poisoned by her doctors (p. 183)? She got better in the hospital. Will Hale was arrested (p. 195). The arrests were a national sensation (Chapter 19). Americas judicial institutions and policing agencies were corrupt (p. 198). Plots continued to eliminate witnesses (p. 200).

After talking to the defense lawyers Ernest Burkhart refused to testify for the state (p. 205). Later her reversed himself and pled guilty (p. 211). The original plan was to use poisoned moonshine (p. 215). Hale and Ramsey were convicted and sentenced for life (p. 220). The oil fields played out, revenue diminished, people moved away (Chapter 22). Building gambling casinos provided new sources of revenue. So too a lawsuit where the US government paid for past mismanagement of oil funds. Some of the murders were never solved (Chapter 23). A logbook from the Office of Indian Affairs listed a guardian and his wards (many of them dead). Too many for a natural death rate (p. 281). Attempted murders were not prosecuted (p. 282). The number of murders was high. A high percentage of the countrys leading citizens were guilty of murder (p. 291).

Grann thanks the people who contributed to this project (Acknowledgments). This book on based on primary and unpublished materials (p. 297). At times this book seems to run on too long, but its facts are important for anyone interested in true crime and what they reveal about society. It explains some of those old B Westerns where a prominent citizen is revealed as the secret leader of a gang of outlaws.",1521676800,5,killer flower moon david grann staff writer new yorker author lost citi z bestsel translat 25 languag honor outstand journal georg polk award 2017 book 338 page content three chronicl 26 chapter note select bibliographi index discoveri oil osag indian nation 1920 oklahoma made richest peopl world seri murder began fbi began investig use former texa ranger solv mysteri undercov team dozen peopl murder book histori osag nation driven land kansa rocki land northeast oklahoma oil discov osag began collect million royalti chapter 1 molli burkhart worri sister miss three day two bodi found murder purpos allot system end commun way life chapter 4 remain land cheroke given white settler via land rush septemb 1893 oklahoma mean red peopl choctaw languag osag agreement reserv miner right osag tribe kill continu chapter 5 least 24 member tribe die nation public literari digest articl p 94 osag tribal council ask help depart justic p 96 team fbi agent began investig two overtli covertli chapter 9 guardian administr osag indian often swindl chapter 14 among promin white citizen judg ignor

31460,583,3904,"Ive enjoyed Lori Fosters Body Armor series, but Ill admit Ive been waiting for this story. Since the first book Ive been a bit enamored by agency owner Sahara Silver. She is tough, she is skilled, she is dedicated, and she is persistent and Ive enjoyed her interactions with Brand Berry as she has tried to recruit him for her stable of ex-MMA fighters turned bodyguards. Fast Burn was fun and sexy, but it also had heart making it a joy to read.

Sahara Silver inherited Body Armor when her brother was declared dead and even though she still doesnt believe he is dead, she had dedicated herself to making the company bigger and better which is why she has recruited the best men for the job. I liked that Sahara was tough, capable, but also fair and obviously good to the people she employed because they were loyal and protective of her to a fault. She wants Brand Berry to come and work for her because she knows he will be excellent at the job, but if he works for her then that will complicate that attraction that burns between them.

Sahara and Brand were a good match, even though she drove him crazy with her need to do things on her own even when the odds were stacked against her. I love that he admired her resourcefulness and realized quickly she was more than capable of helping herself, but he wanted to protect her all the same. Sahara was so intuitive about Brands family complications and I appreciated that she wanted to help him even knowing it would make him angry. I understood her reasoning and while she did eventually see Brands side of things, I also think he realized it was her way of helping him even when he didn't want it.

These were two stubborn alpha people and so it was interesting watching them figure out how to be together and make their life work.
Ms. Foster gave us plenty of time with the crew from the first three books which was nice as we got to see where they are in their relationships and it gave readers good closure to this series.

Fast Burn ends the Body Armor series on a high note with memorable characters, a fast paced action story, and some burning love!

The concept was intriguing, but I found the plot too be a little too slow at times. Too much dialogue, not enough action. The upside is the twists and turns--this is not a straightforward book. There's stolen identities, infidelity, family secrets, etc. What made me sit up and pay attention to the story was the--spoiler alert--another murder in the middle of the book, of one of the central characters.

31466,4349,2178,"The Whispering Room is the second novel in the Jane Hawk series. The first novel, The Silent corner kicked of the series, to a phenomenal start! I absolutely LOVED the sci-fic twist in a novel in the crime fiction genre. Jane Hawk is a likeable, strong and feisty protagonist. In the series she refuses to backdown, despite being confronted with her darkest fears. . .

Cowardice was the default position of the times

The novel opens with Cora Gunderson, a 40yr old SEN teacher from Minnesota, as she goes about her morning routine. Only this morning, there is the presence of a strange man in her kitchen. Cora has been suffering from migraines lately, she often dreams of fire and has some memory loss. With her current circumstances causing her enough alarm, for her to be documenting her feelings in a journal.

Across the US, ex-FBI agent Jane is preparing to make her move on a journalist. A journalist that had recently written an article on David James Michael aka DJ the Silicon Valley billionaire connected to the nanomachine web implants. But Jane has her back against the wall, as she is wanted in connection to several deaths. She is currently listed on the NICI National Crime Information Centre Website, as a fugitive.

Killing to save the word  Why is that hard to believe? Its as old as history

Jane must also be one step ahead of the individuals she investigates. Everything she has uncovered points to their ruthless and depraved actions and disregard for the law. These individuals are wealthy, powerful and well-connected.

As Cora finishes her morning routine, she prepares for the act before her. by the end of the morning, she will have driven a vehicle engulfed in flames into the Veblen hotel. The fire will leave a substantial death toll and a devastated community. But was it all pre-arranged? Or was Cora mentally ill and hearing the voice of god? Sheriff Luther Tillman is the local police officer frozen out of the investigation. But having personally known Cora, it is a case he can not let go.

Meanwhile Jane is learning more about Lawrence and his involvement with the people she fears are leading the nanomachine project. She also learns he has scrupulous ties to his own wifes death just a year earlier. Everything Jane learns fuels her desire for revenge and wish to see justice brought to those involved. Using mysterious contacts given to her by the hacker. She must navigate a criminal world, staying under the radar of law enforcement.

If her loathing were a poison, they would all be dead

The lengths the powerful people will go to, to control the free will of others, is truly dark and depraved. In the last novel we learnt of the club Aspasia, where young women have their personalities and memories wiped to ensure they are the perfect sex slave. The club boasts of offering women, who will give complete and utter submission. There are no lengths this organisation won't go to, to get what they want.

Hell had several levels

Sheriff Luther Tillman continues to discreetly investigate Coras actions. What Cora did goes against everything he has ever known. He locates the journals, just before a fire breaks out at Coras house and all other evidence is lots. What he discovers, is a series of comments, repeated over and over again. Ive got ice in my veins and talk of a spider in her head laying eggs. Was Cora suffering a mental health breakdown? Or do these phrases offer a clue to her suffering? With the death of a governor and congressman among the dead, Luther has no access to the evidence. Just the journals and a good old fashioned hunch. . .

Taking refuge in the hopeless nature of anything was just a form of cowardice

Jane follows the clues determined to gather the knowledge needed to penetrate DJs security at his personal residence in San Francisco. She comes across clues leading her to the mysterious location of Iron Furnace. With information of a place called the whispering room but what does it all mean? And how is it all connected?

The early bird doesnt just get the worm; he gets the worms entire family

Luther follows the trail of a conference recently attended by Cora. Shortly before her symptoms developed. A conference held in the small town of Iron Furnace. . .

Play Manchurian with me

This series is fantastic! It is extremely dark in places yet has a complex and well-planned plot. It has the action scenes of a movie or TV series. With Jane our protagonist hero, on a selfless mission to take down the powerful elite. 5*

31468,2407,3813,"Hardly a day goes by without some ""human interest"" story in the news about those impacted by wars and possible genocide. Most moving in these stories are the pictures of children injured, outside ruined homes, on crowded boats fleeing to hoped for safety. But then, the news moves on, and we never really see what happens to these families after the cameras move on.

The Girl Who Smiled Beads is written by one of those children. Clemantine Wamariya was a pre-schooler when the genocide in Rwanda began. Separated early from her parents and some siblings, she and her teen-aged sister--and soon, that sister's own infants--began a years long trek up and down the African continent away from death and in search of safety. Ultimately, they reached the US. A loving family took Clementine under their wings, and she received an education at the best of suburban schools outside Chicago. While in high school, an essay she wrote comparing her experiences to some of the narrative in Elie Wiesel's Night won her a spot on the Oprah television show. So moved by the story, Oprah's company arranged to have Clementine's parents and siblings flown to New York for a surprise reunion.

This is the Cinderella part of her story, but The Girl Who Smiled Beads provides a far deeper and moving picture of her full experience. There are flashbacks to her life struggling just to find a little clean water for her infant nephew. There is the separate experience of her sister whose life turned out much differently and yet who had grit and persistence few of us would ever be able to generate going through domestic abuse in addition to the life on the run of a refugee. There are honest ruminations of trying to reconcile her life as a suburban teen ager with accepting the now somewhat foreign ways of her more traditional Rwandan parents.

Wamariya openly shares her emotional journey, as she struggles with something like survivor guilt in her years at an exclusive prep school and ultimately Yale, but she also continues to express deep and abiding love for her family, especially that older sister whose strength carried them through the very difficult refugee years.

This is a must-read story for anyone concerned with how the great upheavals of our time are impacting the lives of millions every day. There are times when the story becomes a bit hard to follow, as the author combines narrative of her life in the US with returns to the African journey.

It is a touching, sad, funny and beautiful story of love, loss and finding out what you can live with and what you can't. Stay With Me is set in the political upheaval of Nigeria that echos the upheaval of family and love
  I loved learning about the customs and superstitions of this culture and also how younger generations bridged between modern living and old beliefs.  Pressures are high to conform to some of the cultural norms (many wives and children) but not to others (not educating women). Yejide and especially Akin are caught between their own wants and the expectations of their families.
  Yejide was a very strong female character and I felt her pain and loss. She very much loved Akin and even though she felt betrayed by him she still loved him.  She still chose to be his wife. Akin was a character that I liked at first but as the story went on, I liked him less and less.  He is truly devoted to Yejide but I found him weak and hypocritical.

And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for
--River of Dreams - Billy Joel, Songwriters, Billy Joel

And during the Wukan protests in 2011, according to an interview with the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong, Zhuang had learned an important lesson, he told the reporter: The biggest fortune in life is not health but freedom.

Much of this is centered in Flushing, New York, but there is enough context of life in China to get a fairly thorough understanding of why this family, along with others, left another country for the American Dream. A picture of their life before, and a picture of their life after, and not only how different the lifestyles were from Wukan to Flushing, but most likely how far from reality their dream of life in America was  and yet, how grateful for the freedom.

I wanted to read this as, fairly recently, my brother married a woman (whom I adore) who had emigrated to America from China around the same time as this couple. She lived in Flushing with her then husband and their young daughter. I know how hard it was for her to leave family behind, and start a new life in America, and then again, alone with her children, to start again in a new place as a single mother.

For me, while their stories are very different, there is an element there that made this feel so honestly portrayed, and I loved that. Their frustrations, their day-in-day-out living as new immigrants, and their experiences getting documented, finding work, trying to work their way up an American ladder of dreams which were very slow to be fulfilled. And always parting with money that is so very difficult to come by, and so easily gone. Trying to learn American ways, the English language, a new neighborhood, and then another new neighborhood, followed by yet another.

Lauren Hilgers began writing this non-fiction account in 2012, thinking of it as a magazine story about Wukan Village in the time following the protests, but as life changed, so did this story. Beginning in China and ending up in New York City, while this is the story of two immigrants, it is also the story of the people of Wukan Village, some of those in person, and some obtained through the internet, as well as Zhuangs collection of documentation.

This is truly an amazing glimpse of a life so different from one most of us have lived, the determination and drive to achieve a better life, and the heartbreaks they endure in search of this life, a life with freedom. This is nothing short of inspirational.

31473,1410,3901,"Idelwild Hall being renovated but not being made public? Did the mysterious woman and her son that were doing the renovation know something no one else knew?

One good thing about the renovation was that it meant Fiona would be able to get inside the school grounds where her sister was found dead on the football field twenty years ago.

Fiona still had questions about her sister's death, and this would be the perfect time to investigate.

THE BROKEN GIRLS moves from 1950 when we meet the four main characters and then back again to present day with Fiona using her journalist's skills to write a story and find more clues to what happened at the school. It looked like more than what the public knew.

During her investigation, Fiona finds something else that happened that was kept from the public.

Fionas investigation heats up when she finds a teacher who was at Idelwild Hall during its hey day. The teacher let Fiona know that no one liked being there - students and teachers alike.

There was something at the school that was sinister and something that everyone wanted to keep quiet or perhaps something they didn't know about but kept the students and teachers on edge.

You won't want to put THE BROKEN GIRLS down.

THE BROKEN GIRLS has lots of secrets, along with ghosts, mean girls, and a school that was for unwanted girls for a reason.

This was my first book by Ms. St. James. Her writing is mesmerizing, detailed, and draws you in so well that you feel as if you are right there with the characters and the drama.

Murders, an old boarding school, corruption, and an awesome story line await the reader. And...how about that cover? A great indication of what is inside.

ENJOY when you read THE BROKEN GIRLS during daylight hours. LOVED the book. 5/5

31476,660,3830,"If plot twists were swooshes, this book would give Nike a run for its money. Just when I thought I had it nailed, the next chapter came along and forced me to think again.

The whole thing starts on a faulty premise: Anna Johnson's parents, Tom and Caroline, committed suicide seven months apart (each waiting for high tide before jumping off a cliff into the ocean). Anna is devastated, but she's beginning to deal with the heartbreak with the help of her new baby, Ella, and Ella's father, Mark Hemmings. She's never been convinced that her loving parents would have done themselves in, so a year later when she gets an anonymous note telling her that the deaths weren't suicides, she becomes even more determined to find out what really happened.

Needless to say, that ruffles some feathers; for sure, Mark (who's a mental health counselor) isn't pleased, and neither is Tom's brother Billy, co-owner with his brother of a once highly profitable car dealership. Despite their misgivings, Anna takes the note to the police, where it ends up in the lap of retired detective Murray Mackenzie, who's still with the department but relegated to a desk job. He's got personal issues as well, in the form of a much-loved wife who is in more than out of a mental rehabilitation facility. In fact, Murray no longer has any real authority to investigate, but something about the case piques his interest and he forges ahead while skirting official channels.

Much of the focus is on what's going on with Anna and Murray (the latter of whom I'd love to read more about). Chapters shift from Anna's and Murray's perspectives to that of an unknown person familiar with the situation, as the TV news wonks are fond of saying. Each chapter adds tidbits of new information, culminating in an exciting, and for the most part surprising, final chapter.

Notice I didn't use the word ""ending;"" that's because what it actually means isn't clear (I think I know, but then what do I know, really)? And if I'm honest, much as I loved the book, even though we see Anna grow more and more paranoid, some of her reactions somehow didn't seem to ""fit.""

But hey, it's the sum of the parts that make a whole, and this book is a whole lot of good.

31477,2571,3894,"I was so looking forward to the release of Hopjoy Was Here, the third Flaxborough Mystery by Colin Watson, and I was not disappointed.  This story is more complex and feels much darker than the previous two books in the series, but Colin Watson once again through his delightful way with words presents a suspenseful mystery with a vivid, varied cast of characters and settings.  He expertly combines humor and sadness as well as injecting some serious commentary about the times and towns like Flaxborough.

Once again, we are with Inspector Purbright and Sergeant Malley.  The police have received a letter about some goings-on at 14 Beatrice Avenue and they are off to investigate.  What they discover leads to the sight of four burly policeman manhandling a bath down the front path of the villa and the police digging around in the drain.  Its a very intriguing beginning.  You aren't quite sure whats in that drain, but imagination goes wild  and it seems pretty disgusting.  The two occupants of the house - nice Gordon Periam, the mild-mannered tobacconist, and his not-so-nice-bit-of-a-bounder lodger Brian Hopjoy  cant be found, or . . . ewww.  The mysterious Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-dee, aka Ross and Pumphrey show up to butt into the police investigation, all hush hush.  James Bond, anyone?

Forensics, albeit forensics of 1957 or 1958 since DNA testing wasn't used until 1986, come into play, but Warlock of the Forensic Science Labs, whose motto is hang em by a thread is pretty good at collecting and analyzing the evidence.  Theres a lot of it, and nothing is as it seems.

Hopjoy Was Here is a solid mystery, with clues provided along the way but nothing is obvious.  I didn't figure things out until the end.  And as always, due to Colin Watsons mastery of the English language, I was left with some vivid images of people or places, a couple of new words or phrases to use, and some grooming tips.  Ill leave you with these examples:  People:  Pumphrey - had a habit of pulling his right ear lobe as if it put him in circuit with an electronic sensor, or jerking his long, pointed head forward and from side to side, as if his thoughts had to be continually shaken in their box to prevent them sticking together, and he stopped and turned his eyes, like those of an El Greco Christ, upon Ross.  Warlock - rose and slipped his restless hands into his trouser pockets, where they continued to rummage like inquisitive mice.  New words:  Maybe you think Im being a bit of a stupid-sides, and I don't think I can recall a case of fiancecide.  And finally, some fashion and grooming:  Although an almost offensively inept hair style  plaits coiled into round pads over her ears  early Star Wars?  And lastly, Purbright at the barber shop:  Ah, you're very wise sir; clipping does tend to stimulate.  I personally find the best answer to what we might vulgarly call the hair nose-hole is to fire it a couple of times a year.  His eyes wandered to a jar stacked with wax tapers. like a railway embankment, you know.  Purbright shook his head vigourously.  And you must be laughing by now.

I thoroughly enjoyed Hopjoy was here and unhesitatingly recommend it.  Read it for the words; the good mystery is a bonus.

31478,1580,3894,"Farrago Books, UK is currently republishing the Flaxborough Mystery series, British police procedurals set in the 60s which feature Inspector Purbright and his sidekick, Sergeant Love. This mystery, the third in the series, is quite a convoluted case because there is no body, just hints that a crime may have been committed. To make matters even murkier, the local police learn that the missing man, Brian Hopjoy, has been working as a secret agent, so now they must deal with MI5 agents who want to keep everything on the hush-hush.

I am quite enjoying these old chestnuts. Colin Watson had an interesting way of describing his characters and situations--with a wry sense of humor, biting his tongue, fully descriptive yet not revealing all. Some examples:

Here Inspector Purbright is describing his Chief Constable to the forensic scientist examining evidence: ""Have you met old Chubb, by the way? Oh you must. He thinks that crimes in this town are committed only in his policemen's imagination.""

Describing MI5 Agent Pumphrey: ""Purbright noticed his habit of jerking his long, pointed head forward and from side to side, as if his thoughts had to be continually shaken in their box to prevent them sticking together.""

Describing the spinster Miriam Cook, a nosy neighbor: ""Pouring tea was an occupation that gave this stringy, straight-backed woman a kind of fulfillment. Her thin mouth was set in concentration. The big nose with a wart on its side seemed to stretch forth in anxious assessment of the strength and fragrance of the brew. Her eyes, pale and uncalm with hypochondria, steadied to measure the mounting amber line; there even shone in them a little pride.""

I was fully convinced that I knew exactly what was going on here in this story, but lo and behold, Watson pulled the rug out from under my beautiful theory and surprised me, creating an ending that was ironic and satisfying. And I loved that Purbright got the ever-serious Agent Pumphrey with a joke at the end! Perfect!

31480,693,1228,"If you're an Agatha Christie fan and can at least tolerate science fiction, you might enjoy Mur Lafferty's Nebula-Award nominee Six Wakes. I didn't. This sci-fi mystery illustrates the worst of both genres.

Why was this book nominated for a Nebula Award?
As a mystery story, Six Wakes is as contrived as the least believable of the cozy mysteries by Agatha Christie and her many imitators. The book is based on the most annoying sort of whodunit: a locked-room mystery. As science fiction, it fails to pass the smell test. There's nothing even remotely credible about the characters or the world the book depicts. I simply couldn't suspend disbelief. And the credibility gap grew steadily all the way to the end.

An interesting premise gone far awry
Lafferty would have us believe that sometime in the 23rd century, it had become possible to upload a human being's consciousness, memory, and personality in a mindmap and insert it like software into that person's clone. Fair enough. While that's far-fetched given today's science, mindmapping isn't totally beyond the bounds of the imagination based on laboratory results in neuroscience today. And human cloning will certainly be within technical reach in the decades ahead (assuming it hasn't already been achieved). Unfortunately, Lafferty goes off the deep end with this premise. She imagines a virtual war between clones and humans, apparently for religious reasons. (Clones are not legally human on Earth or Luna inSix Wakes.) One corollary of the new technology is what appears to be an epidemic of assassination of clones by other clones simply because the victim's mindmap is routinely stored offline and can easily be inserted into a new clone body.

Are you with me so far? No? Well, that bit about the war among the clones got by me, too.

A cockamamie story that gets less credible as it unfolds
Now imagine an interstellar spaceship that is three miles long and one-and-a-half miles in diameter, heading off on a 400-year journey from the Moon to an Earth-like planet called Artemis orbiting Tau Ceti, in the constellation Cetus. The Dormire is ""the first human generational ship to leave Earth for better skies."" It's the end of the 25th century, so all this is possible, presumably. The ship houses more than 2,000 humans in suspended animation, plus the mindmaps of a large number of clones. An artificial intelligence (AI) actually runs the ship. The crew consists of six clones, all of whom are criminals, including an undetermined number of murderers; each of them has experienced multiple lives and is more than 200 years old. We're told that these criminals have been enlisted as crew because they needn't be paid. For them, the payoff is that their records are to be wiped clean when they arrive on Artemis.

Against this backdrop, we are plunged into a mystery at the outset. The members of the crew have all just woken up in young new bodies some 25 years after departing from the Moon. One of them had murdered all the others and then somehow died as well. To make matters worse, the AI has been disabled, and all the ship's memory has been wipedincluding the mindmaps of the six clones in the crew. In other words, they're all going to die for real long before they reach their destination.

Have you had enough? I have. I've read many a sci-fi mystery that would have been far more worthy of a major award than Six Wakes.

Who is responsible for nominating this novel for an award?
I'm wondering what all those science fiction writers had in mind when they nominated this book for the 2018 Best Novel Award. (Yes, it's actually the authors who choose these winners. They're the voting members of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, or SFFWA. Of which I must admit I've been a member of one sort or another for more than 40 years.) However, there is at least one genuinely outstanding novel among the six nominees.

31484,564,657,"I was very excited to read A Plague of Giants because it was written by Kevin Hearne, the same author who wrote the Iron Druid Chronicles! Sign me up to a new series! was what was running through my mind. Man, oh man, I wanted to stop reading this book so many times but I kept on going. I will say that if you truly love epic fantasies then this book will be a delight to read and own. There is a wonderfully illustrated map in the front that illustrates the six nations of Teldwen as well as portraits of the main characters in this story. The portraits are very cool and I love that there is also a little narrative with each that gives a description of who they are. Also, there is a nice little appendix in the back with more details to add to the story.

Now when I mention main characters I am not talking about a few characters with two or three different points of view, I am talking about eleven characters with eleven points of view! Thats a lot of POVs to follow. There are two major characters in this story and they are Fintan, Bard of the Poet Goddess, he is the one who tells the tales from the past and weaves the narratives together and Dervan Du Alobar, a Brynt historian, who was brought in to document the Bards tale, and he keeps the story in the present. Fintan tells the story of how the plague of giants came to be and represents all the major players from that story while Dervan deals with the current drama that unfolds with the races and cultures who do not support the tales the bard is expressing.

The main plot of this story was that there had been a subtle invasion of giants and how the six nations of Teldwen were affected by the invasion. Sounds fascinating if you are really interested in the effect that it caused but I wasnt. I wasn't made to care about the country or its inhabitants on a personal level. For me it was more like reading news coverage on an invasion that happened in a place I knew of but I was removed from because I had no emotional investment outside of empathy for the plight of the characters. That will not be the case for everyone but it was for me. Plus, the beginning dragged a bit and by the time the pace started to pick up I was already meh.

Plots within plots, both in the past and in the present, it is a lot to follow. There are many battles that are fought within this story but not only are there physical battles but there are also battles within the characters themselves. Many of them are regular people who must make extraordinary decisions in the most stressful of circumstances and not every choice leads to a happy ending. In fact, there are rarely any happy outcomes in this entire book. I liked that the characters found within this book were not typical. They were made up of refugees, academics, officials, magically inclined, and ordinary people. There were also representative of six different cultures as well.

To be fair there was so much to love with this story, the writing is amazing, the world building, the cultures, the characters are all so well developed. A Plague of Giants just has so much to offer! It was just a huge story that I felt that I pushed through to the end but I will be truthful and say that I will probably read the next book in this series. Why do you ask?

31490,1971,143,"Tackling a trial about murder and underlying racism is a tough enough subject, but handling it through three vastly different narrators adds a significantly challenging layer, especially when one character is an avowed skinhead.  Picoult has done her research and deftly manages to make the defense attorney who grew up in a higher middle class neighborhood and was afforded privilege all her life believable and likeable.  In addition,  the labor and delivery nurse Ruth has both a wide range of nursing experience under her belt and enough true emotion as a widow with a teenage son who has worked her way into the nearby neighborhood of her defense lawyerthat she is not only believabld, but you would not dare feel sorry for her because you realize that is the last thing she would want.  Lastly, Turk, the young father-to-be who helps his father-in-law run  a white supremarist group both online and in meetings, is seen as patently hate-filled except for the moments of care, devotion, and tenderness he shows Brit his wife.

A couple who ask that Ruth have no contact with them or their baby, a baby who dies while Ruth is on watch (against their request, but ordered to do so when  an emergency c-section takes place), and a hospital who decides that Ruth should be liable (not the hospital) meld together into a story that is more about people, beliefs,  and relationships than about just a trial.  Exciting at times, heart-rending  at moments, and excruciatingly painful throughout,  this book would be a fabulous starting point for community discussions of race, especially for white people who, like myself, need to look into a mirror and examine what thoughts and actions we hold regarding privilege, bias  stereotypes, and race.",1521676800,5,tackl trial murder underli racism tough enough subject handl three vastli differ narrat add significantli challeng layer especi one charact avow skinhead picoult done research deftli manag make defens attorney grew higher middl class neighborhood afford privileg life believ likeabl addit labor deliveri nurs ruth wide rang nurs experi belt enough true emot widow teenag son work way nearbi neighborhood defens lawyerthat believabld would dare feel sorri realiz last thing would want lastli turk young fathertob help fatherinlaw run white supremarist group onlin meet seen patent hatefil except moment care devot tender show brit wife coupl ask ruth contact babi babi die ruth watch request order emerg csection take place hospit decid ruth liabl hospit meld togeth stori peopl belief relationship trial excit time heartrend moment excruciatingli pain throughout book would fabul start point commun discus race especi white peopl like need look mirror examin thought action hold regard privileg bia stereotyp race

I always love when Patricia Brigg's publishing schedule rolls around to an Alpha & Omega release. I hadn't realized that the last book in the series, Dead Heat, was released in 2015! I find myself taking better to Charles and Anna's story than Mercy's. Don't get me wrong, I love Mercy, but there's something that's just so satisfying in Charles and Anna's relationship.

Burn Bright begins with Charles watching over the pack while Bran is away. Of course, this is going to be a time when things go wrong, and this ""wrongness"" manifests itself when two of Bran's ""Wildlings"" are attacked. Wildlings are those of the Marrok's pack who are unable, for various reasons, to function in society. They mostly live in the secluded areas of Aspen Creek dealing with only the most dominant wolves of the pack. It seems as though someone is searching for something specific to the Wildlings, and as Anna and Charles investigate, they discover there might be a traitor in their midst, and a darkness that's been brewing for centuries.

Right off the bat, I loved that this story was centralized to Aspen Creek. Most of Charles and Anna's stories in the past have involved them travelling somewhere or another, but I liked that this one remained close to home. The ""close to home"" idea also enhances the fact of the traitor and really brings to mind how deep of a blow this is to the Pack.

I love how Patricia Brigg's entwines the Alpha & Omega / Mercy storylines so the timeline is set up pretty nicely, we know generally where things have left off in the Mercyverse which is kind of important for understanding why Bran is away at the beginning of this book.

I wasn't expecting how much Burn Bright ruminates on the past, and how we still see Anna, not struggling, but contemplating her life as a werewolf. It seems like it's been a lot longer, but in bookworld, Anna has only been a werewolf for a few years. It was interesting, to say the least, to be reminded of this, and also to be reminded of how Anna still struggles with what was done to her by her former Pack. I feel like I lost sight of how bad that was for her. While not happy about the trauma Anna suffered, I liked putting these things back into perspective because the theme of the past popping up again runs throughout the story not just where Anna is concerned.

One of the only issues I had was that I wish I was able to go back and re-read the books again. I think Burn Bright stands well on its own, and three years after the previous book was released it's certainly not difficult to get into the story and understand it, but I feel like I missed some of the nuances due to the fact that I'd forgotten some of what I thought her minor details from the previous books. I look forward to doing a re-read of the series as soon as I can though!

Probably my favorite thing about Burn Bright is Leah. Specifically, getting a more in-depth look at her character. She's been a character I think a lot of readers love to hate. Knowing her history with Mercy and up to this point seeing how she's been portrayed it's been easy to dislike her. I loved that Patricia Briggs was able to show us another side. I didn't finish reading with a sudden love and / or sympathy for her character, but I liked that we get to see her act without Bran, we get to see her making the alpha decisions. Even though Charles is technically more dominant than her, she's still the second, and we get to see how effective her place in the Pack truly is. Plus, the glimpses we get of the relationship between Bran and Leah make me hope that one day we'll get a short story featuring them because they have an interesting dynamic / arrangement between them.

Overall, I really enjoyed this installment in the series. I wish we now didn't have to wait another 2-3 years for the next one. As is typical, the main storyline is tied up pretty well, but there are always threads left hanging waiting for Patricia Briggs to pick up in the next book.",1521676800,4,45 alway love patricia brigg publish schedul roll around alpha omega releas hadnt realiz last book seri dead heat releas 2015 find take better charl anna stori merci dont get wrong love merci there someth that satisfi charl anna relationship burn bright begin charl watch pack bran away cours go time thing go wrong wrong manifest two bran wildl attack wildl marrok pack unabl variou reason function societi mostli live seclud area aspen creek deal domin wolv pack seem though someon search someth specif wildl anna charl investig discov might traitor midst dark that brew centuri right bat love stori central aspen creek charl anna stori past involv travel somewher anoth like one remain close home close home idea also enhanc fact traitor realli bring mind deep blow pack love patricia brigg entwin alpha omega merci storylin timelin set pretti nice know gener thing left mercyvers kind import understand bran away begin book wasnt expect much burn bright rumin past

31495,2242,1677,"John Hart is a very good writer, you can feel every bit of sick horrible deaths of young women, each one.  It takes skill to make one feel it through the written word.  This book didn't need any of that.  Beyond the epical, sick, brutal, and ritualistic murders portrayed, the story's only other major flaw was the survival of the 'hero' a former sheriff that was wrongly convicted of murdering his girl friend and survived 13 years in prison being tortured by the warden and prisoners.  Way over done.

So why did I even give it even two stars?  I don't know.  I kept hoping I wouldn't have to but it down so often?  The characters were well drawn as the novel went on, but they took too many opportunities to ruminate on their lives for 3,4,5 pages at a time. I don't think I missed anything by skipping past them.  Maybe because I finished it.

Altogether I think Mr. Hart is fine writer but this book was far to harsh for me.

31496,81,1266,"A sci-fi retelling of Snow White / Cinderella is a great story idea, but I'm a little underwhelmed at how author Marissa Meyer has executed it here. The villains are pretty one-note, the love interest is whiny and entitled, and there are some fairly severe worldbuilding and character issues that are never properly addressed. Why are cyborgs like Cinder -- who are essentially just humans that have received lifesaving medical implants -- treated as second-class citizens? Does the prince share this prejudice, and if not, how does he reconcile his nation's policies? (Or if so, how does Cinder reconcile her feelings for him?) These are the sort of basic details that should undergird the plot, and by not developing them with clarity, Meyer is never able to get me to fully invest in her story.

31498,2457,3642,"Much of this story is told from the perspective of 13 year old Leni.  This girl has moved so many times in her young life that she has the whole routine down:  moving, starting over, being the new girl at school so many times. She'd never yet found a place she'd fit in.  There is a big part of her childhood when her dad is gone, fighting a messy and ugly war in Vietnam.  When he returns, he has a tension that won't settle.  The opportunity presents itself for the family to move permanently to a remote part of Alaska and this fires up her dad like she's never seen him fired up before.  In four days time, they have secured an old VW bus,  packed it to the gills, and headed north from Seattle.

There are a couple of aspects of this book that captured me.  For one thing, this family is moving to a very primitive part of Alaska.  There are old timers there who know how to live through the dark, cold, almost unbearable winters.  Winters are made even more harsh when you trek out to the outhouse, when you put up all your own food, when neighbors depend on neighbors for company and for survival.  Anyone who is going to make it in bleakness of an Alaskan winter, has got to be strong and self sufficient.  Kristen Hannah does a terrific job of illustrating the breathtaking beauty of the Alaskan way of life while balancing the harshness of every day survival.

The Great Alone is certainly a tale a human survival in a harsh wilderness.  It is also a poignant and gripping tale of a family struggling for survival.  Dad's PTSD is exacerbated by the hours of darkness and solitude and alcohol is his medicine.  Leni and her mom are left to deal with the consequences of his behaviors. Ms Hannah is able to draw strong characters.  She is a master at depicting the essential bonds between Leni and her mom, Leni and her dad,  and the puzzling relationship between mom and dad.

There is a strong community in this isolated corner of Alaska but there are conflicts within the community that only add to the stress of the scary winters.  There are insiders and outsiders, people who want to move forward in time and people who want time to stand still.  As a reader, I got to know even the relatively minor characters who reside in and impact the community. The author highlights  the strength of the women in this book.  Large Marge is amazing and someone that I would love to sit down and get to know better.  Leni has their guidance as she grows into an independent and strong woman. Painful choices carve her life out but her wisdom and compassion create her story.

The story starts in 1974.  About a third of the way into the book, I was beginning to get a bit bored (as in, where are we going with this?).  It felt as if the book should be ending but I could see I was on page 164 of a 440 page book.  The unpredictable was yet to happen.  Fast forward to 1978 and Leni is now close to the end of high school.  The story opens up again.  And that's when I didn't want to stop reading (nor did I want the book to end).  If you are looking for a well written adventure story with strong characters, I highly recommend The Great Alone by Kristen Hannah.  You won't be disappointed.",1521763200,5,much stori told perspect 13 year old leni girl move mani time young life whole routin move start new girl school mani time shed never yet found place shed fit big part childhood dad gone fight messi ugli war vietnam return tension wont settl opportun present famili move perman remot part alaska fire dad like she never seen fire four day time secur old vw bu pack gill head north seattl coupl aspect book captur one thing famili move primit part alaska old timer know live dark cold almost unbear winter winter made even harsh trek outhous put food neighbor depend neighbor compani surviv anyon go make bleak alaskan winter got strong self suffici kristen hannah terrif job illustr breathtak beauti alaskan way life balanc harsh everi day surviv great alon certainli tale human surviv harsh wilder also poignant grip tale famili struggl surviv dad ptsd exacerb hour dark solitud alcohol medicin leni

Connolly also veers from his normal routine by bringing up the woman with the addiction issues.  It really adds nothing to the story and then it drops out as quickly as it came.

Told in a generally linear chronology, the short-stories come to life in an entertaining manner, throwing you right into the legends while simultaneously explaining the backdrop without overwhelming you with an excess of gods/creatures all at once.

The absence of the deep detail allows the author to introduce the more prominent figures (Thor, Odin, Loki) without bogging down the overall flow of the novel, making it effortless in tying the entire universe of stories together.  That is all facilitated by some ""liberties"" by the author that diverge from more traditional chronicles, but the myths shared still maintain the core of their ideals.

31508,4449,1131,"Daddy claims the Hogwarts houses are really gangs. They have their own colors, their own hideouts, and they are always riding for each other, like gangs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione never snitch on one another, just like gangbangers. Death Eaters even have matching tattoos. And look at Voldemort. Theyre scared to say his name. Really, that He Who Must Not Be Named stuff is like giving him a street name. Thats some gangbanging (a no-no word)* right there.

Impactful. I think this one word encompasses my feelings about the entire book. Angie Thomas has created characters that I will think about for a long, long time.

I'm not going to pretend like I know or understand what Starr went through. There's no way for me to know, because I haven't lived that. I haven't experienced that prejudice and hatred. It was eye-opening to read a book from Starr's perspective. She sees the world so differently, and she's forced to live by a separate set of rules based on the color of her skin.

My parents raised me to see color when I looked at another person. Once I was old enough to make decisions for myself, we started to clash on a lot of things, but race seemed to be a big one. I wasn't allowed to play with other kids at school if they didn't look like me, and as a kid that's so (a no-no word)* confusing. My parents actually instructed my teachers to inform them if they saw me interacting with classmates that ""looked different,"" which my teachers obediently did.

If I asked my parents to read this book, I doubt they would. It makes me sad. They're filled with so much hatred and they don't even know why. It's just ""the way things are,"" and that's not okay. It's a (a no-no word)* excuse to exercise hate.

The Hate U Give shows how an entire community, a family, and a girl live in a world full of that hate and indifference. They have different rules to get them through the day, especially if they're pulled over by a police officer. It shouldn't be that way. It's wrong. I don't know why so many people still cannot grasp that concept.

Starr is a strong, brilliant, lovely character. I enjoyed watching her live her life. Yes, she struggled, but she also grew as a person. She fought with friends, learned to understand community, found comfort in her family, and tried to get by in life. No one should have to eat dinner with gunfire going off in the background, or look out their window to see tanks driving down the road.

I think this book needs to be read by everyone (the narrator was wonderful if you enjoy audiobooks). I could talk about the incredible family dynamics (loved Starr's family!), the amazing secondary characters, or the significance of the protests and riots. There is so much being said in this book, and I have too many feelings to adequately express them all.

Angie Thomas is an amazing author that wrote something powerful and beautiful. It's a story that will have a lasting impact on this world, and I hope a lot of people take Starr's story to heart and try to be more understanding and uplifting.

Other quotes I liked:

Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.

At an early age I learned that people make mistakes, and you have to decide if their mistakes are bigger than your love for them.

31517,1970,3901,"I went to boarding school and while I am sorry to say it wasn't Hogwarts, I am happy that it was no Idlewild. If you were a student at Idlewild Hall in the 1950's, your family didn't send you there out of love and the desire for you to receive an excellent education. Instead, it was a place to send your problems. Girls who were illegitimate, girls who caused trouble, girls whom their families did not want. Being unwanted is bad enough, but then being sent to a place believed haunted is how a friendship between four girls is formed until one of them vanishes without a trace.
There are two timelines in The Broken Girls, one at Idlewild Hall in the 1950's and the second in 2014. This is when we meet Fiona Sheridan, a journalist who has never quite gotten over her sister's death 20 years ago. The body was discovered on the grounds of Idlewild Hall, and though her boyfriend was convicted of the crime, Fiona has always believed there was more to the story. While the old school has fallen to ruins, its sale and the discovery of a body cause Fiona to start investigating the past.
So many things were revealed as the story progressed and I had a very hard time putting this book down. The author magically weaves the tale between the different times and different characters and I was totally captivated. There is a malevolent ghost, murder, friendship, and tragedy and it was so well written. I flew through this book and will definitely read it again. I am a no spoiler kind of person, but I will say the characters are complex and the atmosphere was often dark and creepy and I could picture myself being at Idlewild Hall.

31526,681,3837,"Fifteen years ago, at the age of eighteen, Sebastian Gage walked away from Langstone Manor and swore hed never return. Now, it is in view, as cold and brooding as the moors on which it sits. Every nerve in Sebastians body is singing and the tension in the coach is palpable. He certainly didn't want to return, but here he is, all because his grandfather sent him a missive asking him to come and investigate his cousins disappearance. He almost didn't come and probably wouldnt have if Kiera hadnt persuaded him to do so. He and Kiera are tired to the bone because they have traveled from Ireland as quickly as possible. Kiera knows that Sebastians life here was not a happy one, but, since he won't talk about it, she has no idea what that life was really like.

Upon arrival, they are received very coldly by Sebastians aunt  the servants didn't even know they were coming  nor did his aunt. Then, Sebastian learns that not only is his cousin missing, his grandfather is also at deaths door. Had my aunt and cousins treated me the same way Sebastians did, I wouldnt be at all interested in spending my time in a very hostile environment to try to find one of them. However, Sebastian is a very good man and will do what he can to help the family that abused him and his mother.

Albert, Sebastians older cousin and heir to Sebastians grandfathers title, walked out onto the moors one day and nobody has seen him since. Not a single trace of him is anywhere to be found. Then, Alberts brother Rory goes missing as well  and in the same manner. Where could they be? How could they just disappear without a trace? Kiera and Gage are having a really hard time with this investigation because the house is filled with secrets and nobody  even Sebastians grandfather  is telling them what they need to know. They are doing all of that while trying to protect themselves as well because they have also been attacked.

I know every murder mystery has to have a victim, but I really didn't want it to be this one. I came to like this victim more and more as I read more of the book. The villain is a surprise to the reader and to Gage and Kiera. I am so glad we got to know more of Gages early life and that there are some reconciliations. Im also looking forward to their next case in London and to hopefully see Lord Gage (Sebastians father) get a bit of a comeuppance.

As always, Hubers writing is excellent, the story is well plotted and executed, and the characters are fully-developed and engaging. The descriptions of the moors set the mood and immerse the reader in that place and time. You can just feel the fog creeping up around you and surrounding you until you cannot see  and the fear  can you find your way, can you avoid the bogs. Oh! My!

31532,2222,632,"I'm a long time Agatha Christie fan, and I recently decided to re-read some of her novels.

*****

'The Mysterious Affair at Styles' is Agatha Christie's first published book, and it's less sophisticated than her later work. The story does, however, introduce three well-known Christie characters: Hercule Poirot, Captain Hastings, and Inspector Japp.

As the book opens Hastings has been injured in WWI and is recuperating at Styles Court, a manor house in the country. Styles Court belongs to the Cavendish family, and is currently occupied by a diverse assemblage of people, including: Emily Inglethorpe - the widow of the late Mr. Cavendish - who inherited a lifetime interest in the house AND a large sum of money; Emily's new - much younger - husband, Alfred Inglethorpe; Emily's adult stepson, John Cavendish; John's wife Mary; John's bachelor brother Lawrence; Evelyn Howard - Emily's longtime friend and companion; Cynthia Murdoch - the orphaned daughter of family friends; and Dorcas, the maid.

There's a tense atmosphere at Styles because of simmering resentments and secrets. For example:
John Cavendish - who'll inherit the manor house when his stepmother dies - thinks it should have been his all along; in addition, John is suspected of dallying with the pretty wife of a neighboring farmer.
John's wife Mary, in turn, spends a lot of time with Dr. Bauerstein - the local toxicologist who hails from Germany. To add to this 'quadrangle', Captain Hastings has a crush on beautiful Mary.
Evelyn Howard hates Alfred Inglethorpe, convinced he only married Emily for her money.
Alfred Inglethorpe's thick beard looks like a disguise, and he has long poorly explained absences.
Lawrence Cavendish resents Cynthia Murdoch, who's very aware of her status as an 'outsider'; Cynthia supports herself with a job in a pharmacy.....and she seems to be the only one of this bunch who has a job.

As it happens, a group of Belgian refugees, including Hercule Poirot, are living in a house near Styles Court - an arrangement facilitated by Emily Inglethorpe. Hastings is thrilled to see Poirot and lauds the former policeman's detective skills - so it's clear they've met before.

In the midst of the testy atmosphere at Styles Court Emily Inglethorpe dies from strychnine poisoning - in a locked room. Hastings suspects foul play and prevails on Poirot to investigate, and the Belgian complies.....with Hastings as his partner. To round out the 'detective trio', Inspector Japp is assigned to the case.

During the investigation Poirot learns that Emily had a loud fight with an unknown male on the day before she died; Emily's latest will is missing; there have been shenanigans with Emily's locked document box; someone bought strychnine at the town's pharmacy; coffee and cocoa were consumed on the evening of the murder....and a cup has been smashed; there's something suspicious about Emily's medicine packets; etc.

As often happens in these stories, Poirot makes shrewd deductions about everything.....but doesn't share them; Hastings tries to demonstrate his investigative skills but misinterprets most of the clues; and Japp hares off after the wrong suspect(s).

The book is chock full of misdirection and red herrings, but - in the end - Poirot gathers the suspects and reveals the truth.

The book is just so-so. Though Christie's nascent writing skills are apparent, the plot is overly convoluted (to the point of unbelievability); Poirot talks too much (yak yak yak); and there's a whiff of anti-Semitism and classism (though this is common in Christie's books......a sign of her times.)

If you're a long time Agatha Christie fan, this book would make a fun re-read; and if you're new to the famous author's works, this is a good place to start.",1521763200,3,im long time agatha christi fan recent decid reread novel mysteri affair style agatha christi first publish book le sophist later work stori howev introduc three wellknown christi charact hercul poirot captain hast inspector japp book open hast injur wwi recuper style court manor hous countri style court belong cavendish famili current occupi diver assemblag peopl includ emili inglethorp widow late mr cavendish inherit lifetim interest hous larg sum money emili new much younger husband alfr inglethorp emili adult stepson john cavendish john wife mari john bachelor brother lawrenc evelyn howard emili longtim friend companion cynthia murdoch orphan daughter famili friend dorca maid there ten atmospher style simmer resent secret exampl john cavendish wholl inherit manor hous stepmoth die think along addit john suspect dalli pretti wife neighbor farmer john wife mari turn spend lot time dr bauerstein local toxicologist hail germani add quadrangl captain hast crush beauti mari evelyn howard hate alfr inglethorp convinc marri emili money alfr inglethorp thick beard look like disguis long poorli explain absenc lawrenc cavendish resent cynthia murdoch who awar statu outsid cynthia support job pharmacyand seem one bunch job

31537,38,3834,"For many people, the idea of vegan and comfort food are seldom in the same sentence, let a lone a book title. In fact, many people think of vegan as the opposite of comfort food, so Lauren Toyotas Hot for Food Vegan Comfort Classics is a challenge to that idea. Now, for me, one of my comfort foods is roasted brussels sprouts with a bit of lemon juice or balsamic vinegar, so to me, vegan comfort food sounded interesting. I am not vegan, but I love vegetables and fruits and think we are all a little better off the more vegetables we enjoy.

Hot for Food Vegan Comfort Classics is full of beautiful photos of foods that will make you drool, foods full of carbs and calories, foods with fried and baked breaded crusts, foods with gravies and sauces that are lush and indulgent. This is, in some ways, a book that challenges the idea of vegan food as health food. But then, there are more reasons for embracing veganism than health.

There are two ways to approach vegan cooking. One is to go for it without regret, to enjoy the bounty of nuts, fruits, vegetables, and grains you can enjoy. The other is to focus on what you are missing and seek ways to replace the flavors and textures of meat and dairy with vegan alternatives. Hot for Food Vegan Comfort Classics takes the latter approach which I think of as regretful veganism. The veganism of loss.

Which is why this book is a mixed bag. There are lots of excellent recipes, though many are too carb and fat-loaded for this diabetic. I love the idea of a cauliflower burger as shown on the cover. Cauliflower is mild enough to take on the flavor of whatever you want it to, so added buffalo chicken spices will make it tasty. The problem for me is that this is all about recreating non-vegan comfort foods with meat and dairy substitutes. I was hoping that this might also be about creating new comfort foods made with vegetables. Rather than bangers and mash, maybe a pea soup flavored with the smokiness of coffee? Is it really comforting to make a recipe based on what you miss rather than something new? To me, this cookbook focuses on what veganism deprives you of rather than on exploring how vegan recipes can be exciting and delicious in their own right and creating new classics.

I received a copy of Hot for Food Vegan Comfort Classics from the publisher through Blogging for Books.

31542,2032,189,"Before We Were Yours is a novel by Lisa Wingate.  The novel is based on the story of the Tennessee Childrens Home Society and Miss Georgia Tann who ran an orphan scam from the 1920s to 1950.  In this period of time, thousands of children were stolen or legally taken from their biological homes and adopted by celebrities and wealthy people all around the country.  Some of the adoptive parents were hit up later for even more money for extended legal suits.  Most of the biological parents never say or heard of their children again.  Of the children themselves, many dies of unknown causes or of disease or mistreatment. Thousands were adopted and forgot about their true families.  Still others remembered their past and mourned the loss of their parents and siblings.  Using this story as a backdrop, Lisa Wingate composed a story of one family whose children were taken illegally.  What happens to these helpless children is the basis of this story.  It is well-written and creates a haunting view of live at that time in the homes.
The five children of Briny and Queenie Foss were brought up on a riverboat.  They loved the life and could not envision anything else.  Then Queenie began having problems as she tried giving birth to a set of twins.  Briny took her to the hospital in Memphis leaving Rill in charge of her siblings, Camellia, Lark, Fern, and Gabby. The next morning, when they expected to see Briny, a group of men came and took the five children off the boat to be taken into the care of Miss Tann and the Tennessee Childrens Society.  They were looked upon as a great treat as they, except for Camellia, they all had blond hair and blue eyes.  This was the preferred option for adoptive parents.  Lisa takes us through the sordid life in the Home and the despair Rilla feels when she can neither protect nor keep her siblings together.  Rilla would spend her life trying to find her siblings and make sure they were all right.  She lived for the say she would return to the houseboat and Briny and Queenie would meet her with open arms and minds.
Lisa takes us to the depth of despair in the basement of the home where the siblings are housed until there is room for them upstairs.  We feel Camellias pain and displeasure for being her and her need to fight against it.  How will her rebellion turn out?  We feel Rillas guilt as not keeping her family together and not being able to protect them from harm.  Will Rilla be able to reunite her family?
The book is very well-written and the topic is outstanding.  Although this is about a fictional family, Lisa brings the situation that really existed to the forefront of our mind and does not let us neglect it.  This ranks right up there with the top five books I have read this year which I think are the best I have read.",1521763200,5,novel lisa wingat novel base stori tennesse child home societi miss georgia tann ran orphan scam 1920 1950 period time thousand child stolen legal taken biolog home adopt celebr wealthi peopl around countri adopt parent hit later even money extend legal suit biolog parent never say heard child child mani die unknown caus diseas mistreat thousand adopt forgot true famili still other rememb past mourn loss parent sibl use stori backdrop lisa wingat compos stori one famili whose child taken illeg happen helpless child basi stori wellwritten creat haunt view live time home five child brini queeni fo brought riverboat love life could envis anyth el queeni began problem tri give birth set twin brini took hospit memphi leav rill charg sibl camellia lark fern gabbi next morn expect see brini group men came took five child boat taken care miss tann tennesse child societi look upon great treat except camellia blond hair blue eye prefer option

Reacher found himself following criminals  from one step to another. But would it lead him to the woman? And was she alright? Or not? His determination to find her one way or another kept him going right through to Wyoming. Was that where hed find answers?

The Midnight Line is the 22nd in the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child, and another fast paced, gritty thriller which I thoroughly enjoyed.

The struggles she went through growing up in Tehran as a woman and trying to be something other than a wife and mother are astonishing, especially for someone like me who grew up in the United States and never having those limitations and expectations put on me. I started reading an advance review copy received through NetGalley but after publication, I continued by listening to the incredible audiobook narrated beautifully by Mozhan Marn.

31560,3671,1536,"This was one of those few times that I've watched the movie before reading the book. Like most books to movies, the two are almost completely different. Sometimes that works, most of the times it doesn't. Count this as the third time for me that I thought a movie was equal/better to the book.

Numbering the differences would take WAY too long. I would say if you've only experienced one or the other, go into the book/movie with an open mind.

What I liked about this (my favorite part) was the storytelling voice. Instantly I was like, ""pass the chips! This is a fairy tale!"" I love that fairy tale voice and Gaiman did an excellent job of writing a story that flowed so beautifully in that way.

I loved the descriptions, the flow of the story, the dialogue, etc. There were a few times with the plot where I felt like things could've been elaborated on more: The weird furry man that helps out Tristran. We never see or hear from him again after their separation. How was having a one night stand with a fantasy person Dunstan's heart's desire? Why did Tristran not question what was happening or his origins once his father started helping him leave Wall and he became an exception to crossing the Wall after a cryptic speech?

I thought it was supremely sad that Tristran's family never got to see him again. He stopped by once and we don't get to see that goodbye or get an explanation as to why they couldn't visit each other or why his family couldn't/wouldn't join him.

As far as characters go, most of the development is in Tristran and Yvaine. The rest are left with the barest smudges of characterization. This wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't for the fact that our main two were rather lacking. The characters by far were the weakest point. The villains didn't seem all that scary and in the end the main one [ just gave up her fight. No final showdown or nothing. She and Yvaine part on relatively good terms. It was weird. (hide spoiler)]

Tristran is dull--in more than one way. He's incredibly single-minded and simple. He lacks a strong moral character or really any strong personality traits at all. He falls for the most obvious person in the village, boasts silly things to try and make himself look good, ends up chasing a star--let's face it, the chances of finding a fallen rock that land months distance away is uh, yeah--and then he doesn't even bat an eye over the star being not a rock! Yvaine is a bit dehumnaized by constantly being referred to as the star. But also by the fact that Tristran never once ponders over the morality of dragging a woman away as a present for another woman. Hello!

And she's injured! He doesn't care! He's got tunnel vision on this True Love thing and he's going to kidnap a person and drag them on a 6 month journey without caring for their injuries all to gift them to Victoria. And he never really says he's sorry for that and for months still plans on giving Yvaine to Victoria. I mean, does he expect Victoria to believe this person is a star? What if she decides to keep treating Yvaine as an object since Tristran did and keep her as a pet or something?

In general Tristran shows poor judgement and little remorse. This made him an unlikable character that I couldn't cheer for or bond with in any way.

That left Yvaine to carry the story and though she has lots of great lines and her personality was great, she didn't have ENOUGH of a presence in the story to be the one character carrying it.

I also don't think Tristran deserved the ending he got. He gets HEA even after just being a jerk and only changing his focus once the one path is no longer an option.

Lastly I thought it was kind of a crap move to not return with his mother and not even tell her a time he'd be back. Left her running his kingdom(he didn't even give it to her!) for him while he got to have his fun. Three years with no word from him. And then he's thinking about going home and you know what, nah. He takes 5 more years. Loser. Must be nice to spend your entire life doing whatever you want with no concern for your actions and have it all turn out right. Doesn't matter what choices he made, it all worked out for him. He was free to be a dick and have zero consequences.

That was definitely an area the movie got right. Tristran developed and grew and changed. He matured and became a better person. But yeah, the way he was written was easily my least favorite thing about this book.",1521763200,4,one time ive watch movi read book like book movi two almost complet differ sometim work time doesnt count third time thought movi equalbett book number differ would take way long would say youv experienc one go bookmovi open mind like favorit part storytel voic instantli like pas chip fairi tale love fairi tale voic gaiman excel job write stori flow beauti way love descript flow stori dialogu etc time plot felt like thing couldv elabor weird furri man help tristran never see hear separ one night stand fantasi person dunstan heart desir tristran question happen origin father start help leav wall becam except cross wall cryptic speech thought suprem sad tristran famili never got see stop dont get see goodby get explan couldnt visit famili couldntwouldnt join far charact go develop tristran yvain rest left barest smudg character wouldnt bad
31561,3455,844,"There are three things you should know about this book:
1. It will keep you guessing.
2. You won't be able to put it down.
3. You need it NOW!

Debut? Really? Where have you been Alice Feeney because this manner of storytelling is exactly what we thriller readers needed right now. This is one difficult book to describe as it is something a reader needs to experience themselves. Seriously, limit the number of reviews you read and go into this one blind. Spoilers will only do just that, spoil a magnificently twisty psychological ride for you. Having said that, I have no intentions of offering you any spoilers, but instead give you a look into why you should not walk past this book.

So, Im not gonna lie, it took me a couple days to read this. BUT, if I wasn't employed full-time, a mom to a tot who is fully absorbing the world around him, and (due to this amazing little guy) in desperate need of sleep to function as a member of society, I would have easily devoured this in one sitting. I literally had to pull myself away each night and I could not wait to pick it back up the following night once my son was in bed. With every breadcrumb Alice Feeney fed me I craved more. I just needed to know what was to come next. No joke, having to put this down each night for the aforementioned reasons was the most difficult thing about the novel.

This story is layered and complex in all the right ways. From chapter to chapter pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together nicely. But the twist, boy those twists I did not see coming and I appreciate how Alice skillfully delivered each and every one of them. I felt so many emotions amidst reading this. From heart pounding to breathless, confused to just plain ole dumbfounded. I particular enjoyed that each chapter jumped between events leading up to the incident which ultimately landed Amber in the hospital (THEN), Ambers subconscious while in a coma (NOW), and the childhood diary entries (BEFORE). The diary pages really offered the reader a look into the characters psychosis and where these behaviors as an adult stem from. Every character was well thought out and nicely developed. I really really enjoyed being inside Ambers head. I was still swallowing what I read once I reached the back cover. This is the third book this year to create such emotion in me throughout my reading experience, and long after. Such a clever psychological thriller and as I write this review I am still contemplating and absorbing all I had just read, especially that ending. Im perplexed, and I do not hate the fact that I am. If anything, Im so thirsty for more.

PEOPLE ARE NOT MIRRORSTHEY DONT SEE YOU HOW YOU SEE YOURSELF.

Get this in your cart, check out, read it and also fall in love with an amazing new authors storytelling. There is a reason I immediately followed Alice on all forms of social media, signed up for her newsletter and added her as one of my new favorite authors on Goodreads. I want to keep up on all things Alice and definitely recommended her debut to the masses! I am a fan, Alice Feeney, and I cannot wait to see what you come up with next with Sometimes I Kill. Now, some of you may have noticed I dropped a little question mark in the series category above. Well, that is because, while Im positive these two novels are related, Im unsure if they are being considered a series due to the lack of information provided on this. Can anyone confirm? One things for sure, this novel definitely blew me away and its ending hinted to the fact that these two books are not completely opposing stories with similar titles. Regardless, count me in for any future works by Alice Feeney. I just hope I don't have to wait too long before I can get my hands on it.

31566,4410,3860,"When you're a teenager, relationships feel exceptionally complicated, something Niru and Meredith learn in in Speak No Evil, the new novel from Uzodinma Iweala. They are seniors at a private school in Washington D.C. where he is a track star and is set to attend Harvard in the fall. She is also a runner, but with a more rebellious side, which she can afford as her parents are high-powered D.C. insiders. They are great friends until Meredith tries to make them something more and Niru rebuffs her. This is the first of two acts on her part that will have a profound impact on him. Why? Because Niru is black and he's gay.
Iweala divides Speak No Evil cleanly into two parts: Niru and then Meredith, with both teens telling their story from their point of view. This might seem like a simple choice but it goes well beyond that. It is also the divide between each of their lives-public vs. private, black vs. white, and traditional vs. modern. Niru's parents are from Nigeria where homosexuality is a crime. He is just beginning to accept his feelings, but lives in terror of his deeply conservative father finding out. When he does, his response is extreme in its religiosity and upends Niru's life. Niru, a young man who does everything right, as he's supposed to, but wants love in a way his father believes is a sin to be punished.

On the other side of this divide is Meredith, who, ostensibly, has the teen dream life-all the money coupled with the freedom that comes from parents who are never around. Underneath, of course, there is more than that, as seen later in life when she returns to her family's home after moving to New York City. She doesn't get into Harvard, derailing the plans she and Niru had to go to school together-even if she had hoped they'd be more than friends. Despite the emotions his rejection elicits, she tells no one and understands his pain. Her character is complicated, in that throughout Speak No Evil I feel sympathy for her and can acknowledge the part age played in how she came off, but in the end, I felt as she thought Niru did
 he dismisses my problems because in his mind white people don't have real problems, just issues. Loc 1780
And yet, Iweala doesn't give her short shrift on the page. He writes her in fullness, and much of it-the loneliness, the feelings for a boy who didn't want her the way she wanted him-is heartbreakingly expressed. He just makes her act in a way I had trouble believing. She was not as voiceless or powerless as the story intimates. She had agency. She could act. She chooses not to.
At just over 200 pages Speak No Evil is one of those novels that amaze me because they compact so much depth in a small space. Iweala's depiction of both Meredith and Niru and the tsunami of emotions they felt will resurrect achy memories in all but the most self-assured. Where I separated from the novel is in Meredith's actions at a pivotal moment in its events. Which isn't to say it lessened how I felt about his writing or the story. With the exception of the choice to forego quotation marks for dialogue (a contemporary trend I intensely dislike), making multi-person scenes difficult to follow, Speak No Evil is impactful and sorrowfully realistic.

31568,961,3518,"A friend of mine has been pushing me to look into Jordan Peterson for the past six months.  I thought, since my friend is conservative, that Peterson offered right-wing politics, and it is true that he has recently been in the news for his thoughts on certain charged topics.  However, Peterson does not, in fact, offer politics, which is refreshing in these days of rage.  Rather, ""12 Rules For Life"" is a self-help book constructed like a Russian matryoshka doll, a nested construct.  It talks, and works, on multiple levels, some of which may have political implications, but if so, they are incidental to what the book offers to each human person, both the broken and the whole.

The nested, complex nature of this book really should be no surprise, because Petersons lifes work is the study of the infinitely layered human mind, and his one earlier book, ""Maps of Meaning,"" was an exhaustive analysis of intricate human myths, their roots in our moral beliefs, and their implications for today.  In Petersons view, all moral traditions are, at their root, exemplifications and explications of the opposition of order and chaos, as well as a way of creating shared beliefs, which are immensely valuable to any human society.  His basic point in his Rules is that every individual can avoid the extremes of menacing chaos and tyrannical order by following the Way, the line between order and chaos, through the willingness of everyone to shoulder the burden of Being and to take the heroic path.  This is to live properly, and if we can do this, we can collectively flourish.  Thus, his 12 Rules are guides to this end.

As I says, this is not a political book, but politics is downstream of this bookthat is, if you buy into what Peterson is offering, it probably changes some of your political views.  Petersons basic principle is the imperative need to recognize that reality exists, and given that so much of politics today is built around a wholesale denial of reality, Petersons statements often seem political.  In fact, they are political, even if that is not Petersons intent, or at least not his major intent.  This is especially true of his view of men and women, which permeates the book.

But lets treat the book as it is, rather than treating it as some form of archetype, for it is, if nothing else, highly original, and it is therefore hard to summarize.  Peterson, both an academic and a practicing clinical psychologist, has spent a lifetime talking extensively to many people, most of them troubled, and he thinks very deeply about every word he says (as is clearly evident if you watch interviews with him available online).  That doesnt mean hes didactichis writing tone is conversational and packed with anecdotes, carefully chosen to illustrate or add impact to the points he makes.  But it does mean that nearly every sentence is crowded with meaning.

Rule 1 is Stand Up Straight With Your Shoulders Back.  This is the backbone of all the rules, really, for in its Peterson explains that we are how we are.  We are not malleable beyond a certain point.  His illustration is lobsters, who were already incredibly ancient at the dawn of the dinosaurs, yet who have much in common with humansso much so that anti-depressants perk defeated lobsters up.  Lobsters have a dominance hierarchy.  And, critically, male and female lobsters are radically differentthey act differently, yes, but more broadly, male and female lobster teleology, their purpose, is different, and that is reflected in how each behaves.  For lobsters, and all other creatures, The dominance hierarchy, however social or cultural it might appear, has been around for some half a billion years.  Its permanent.  Its real.  It is [rather than capitalism, or patriarchy, or some other ephemeral manifestation] a near-eternal aspect of the environment. . . . Dominance hierarchies are older than trees.  Males, lobster or not, who fall in the dominance hierarchy have bad lives that get worse, often in a self-reinforcing loop; and they rise in the dominance hierarchy by fighting and winning, which means they get the best food, the best mental and physical health, the best shelter, and the best females.  Similarly, females who rise (who fight only in their maternal stage, but compete otherwise) in the dominance hierarchy have the best mental health, and better physical circumstances by virtue of attracting high-quality suitors, that is, those high in the dominance hierarchy, whom they identify and pursue; those who fall; the reverse.  Whether we like to admit it or not, humans are essentially the same as lobsters. They always have been, and they always will be.

Unlike lobsters, though, humans can self-diagnose that they are at the bottom of the hierarchy, or heading there in a downward spiral, and they can take action to improve their situation.  (Petersons book is about taking action, most of all.)  Falling in a human dominance hierarchy basically means you are being bullied, and though some cant fight back, almost always, its that people won't fight back.  While fighting back can be as simple as changing your view of life, to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, ultimately [t]here is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character.  Given that I have always believed that violence, or at least its threat, is the solution to most problems of human oppression, this certainly resonates with me, though reconciling that with turning the other cheek is difficult, and not something Peterson has much use for, despite obvious deep sympathy with Christianity.  Through standing up for oneself, straight with your shoulders back, using force as necessary (and the willingness to use force likely means it will not be necessary), leads the path to human flourishing, for all.

In Rule 2, Treat Yourself Like Someone You Are Responsible For Helping, Peterson addresses why people sabotage themselves.  He first delves deeply into human mythos, closely analyzing the first chapters of Genesis in particular, though also offering nods to other traditions, such as the Vedic.  This is in service of a deeper exploration of the eternal opposition of order and chaos.  Order is masculine; when good, it is the structure of society, the ice on which we skate; when bad, it is tyranny and stultification.  Chaos is feminine; when good, it is the origin of all things and the maker of all things new, the substance from which all things are made; when bad, it is the dangerous unknown, the chthonic underworld, and the dark water under the ice.  Calling these categories of reality masculine and feminine is not arbitrary; in fact, it comports with what may be the ultimate fundamental fact of human existence, the division into two very different sexes, male and female, natural categories, deeply embedded in our perceptual, emotional and motivational structures.  (You now begin to see why the transgender ideologues are not thrilled with Peterson.)  As with Adam and Eve and their self-sabotage, we sabotage ourselves, not viewing ourselves as worthy of respect, since we are capable of stupidity and evil.  And with this realization we have well-nigh full legitimization of the idea, very unpopular in modern intellectual circles, of Original Sin.  But we can choose to embody the Image of God, instead.  Back is the way forwardas T. S. Eliot insisted [in ""Little Gidding""]but back as awake beings, exercising the proper choice of awake beings.

For Christians, though, this poses a perceived difficulty.  Yes, as Peterson notes, Christianity reduced evil and barbarism in the areas it conquered.  But it encouraged excessive self-sacrifice through erroneous thinking.  Christs archetypal death exists as an example of how to accept finitude, betrayal and tyranny heroicallyhow to walk with God despite the tragedy of conscious self-knowledgeand not as a directive to victimize ourselves in the service of others.  We have to care for others as we care for ourselves; only in that way can both of us flourish.  Peterson explores this line of thought at considerable length; it is impossible to shorten his words and retain the meaning, but it is both fully compatible with Christian belief and an antidote to a certain line of Christian excessive self-abnegation (a failing I found in Thomas  Kempiss The Imitation of Christ, though I hesitate to criticize a book of such renown).

Rule 3 advises us to choose and to see our friends clearly.  You must not only see the best in people.  You can show them to what they should aspire, but you cannot lift them up unless they wish to be so lifted.  Not everyone who is failing is a victim, and not everyone at the bottom wishes to rise.  But Christ himself, you might object, befriended tax-collectors and prostitutes.  How dare I cast aspersions on the motives of those who are trying to help?  But Christ was the archetypal perfect man.  And you're you.  How do you know that your attempts to pull someone up won't instead bring themor  youfurther down?  Again, nearly every word is perfect:  Success: thats the mystery. Virtue: thats what inexplicable. . . . . Things fall apart, of their own accord, but the sins of men speed their degeneration. And then comes the flood.

Rule 4 returns to an internal focus, advising us to Compare Yourself To Who You Were Yesterday, Not To Who Someone Else Is Today.  Just because you can always find an area where someone, or everyone, is better, does not mean that area is or should be relevant to you.  A myriad of games are possible in each persons life; choose your game, choose your starting point, and improve yourself, incrementally and gradually.  In fact, you should reward yourself for doing so, as silly as that sounds.  And if you resent someone else, you need to realize it is either stupid immaturity, in which case you should stop it, or it is a legitimate complaint, in which case you must address it, or it will only get worse and cause more problems.

Next, on Rule 5, Do Not Let Your Children Do Anything That Makes You Dislike Them, Peterson switches gears, from the world of adults to the world of children as it intersects with adults.  He strongly objects to certain psychological tendencies in child-rearing, especially the protection of children from dangers at the expense of making them fully functioning and competent human beings (a problem mainly with male children and their mothers, he says).  Children must be socialized; they are not inherently good (or inherently bad, for that matter).  Individual problems do not call for social restructuring, which is mostly stupid.  Each persons private trouble cannot be solved by a social revolution, because revolutions are destabilizing and dangerous.  Socialization means limitations; limitations facilitate creative achievement, not crimp it.  Along the way, Peterson discusses tangential topics, such as that hierarchies are rarely, if ever, arbitrary.  He recognizes, of course, that each child is very different (as I know, having five myself), but certain basic approaches (including discipline and punish, I assume a joke at Foucaults expense) are the most likely to lead to success, for all of child, parents, and society.

In Rule 6, Peterson returns to adult self-help, Set Your Own House In Perfect Order Before You Criticize The World.  He evaluates here, as he does in more than one place in this book, the nihilism of the smarter Columbine killer, Eric Harris.  This is of course topical, with the present focus on school shootings.  True, they have not actually increased in recent decades, but they have increased from forty or fifty years ago, when children carrying guns to school was unexceptional, and the reason is almost certainly some form of this nihilism.  Peterson is violently opposed to the idea that humans are some kind of plague, as Harris maintained, and he identifies this sort of thinking, common among certain elites today, who adhere to the self-definition of Goethes Mephistopheles as the spirit who negates, as among the worst in the modern world.  (Peterson would prefer Normal Borlaug to William Vogt, in Charles Manns excellent recent ""The Wizard and the Prophet."") Yes, life is very hard, and suffering, great suffering, is nearly inevitable for everyone.  But transformation, not vengeance, is the answer.  Abel, not Cain.  Rather than blaming everyone else for what is wrong, stop today what you know to be wrong, and start doing what you know to be right.  Thereby, you help yourself, and you strike a blow for Being, for the Way, and against nihilism.

Peterson continues the focus on suffering in Rule 7, Pursue What Is Meaningful (Not What Is Expedient).  Here, he dives into Egyptian mythology, as well as several passages from the New Testament.  He returns to, and expands on, his earlier thoughts about the impact of Christianity and the resulting new problems, noting that In consequence [of Christianity], the metaphysical conception of the implicit transcendent worth of each and every soul established itself against impossible odds as the fundamental presumption of Western law and society.  That was not the case in the world of the past, and is not the case yet in most places in the world of the present.  (Ive been saying this for years, but its nice to find someone prominent who agrees with me!)  But in addition to the tendency toward self-abnegation, long a potential problem for flourishing in this life, Christianitys decline has left a void.  Here Peterson talks of Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Milton, Solzhenitsyn, and much more, including his own personal moral development, and returns again to suffering and nihilism, which are bad, but which at least point out, when addressed directly, that there is something good that opposes them.  Expedience is lying and not facing up to your sins and the reality of things.  Meaning is the balance between chaos and order, and it leads to good.  Meaning is the Way, the path of life more abundant, the place you live when you are guided by Love and speaking Truth and when nothing you want or could possibly want takes any precedence over precisely that.  And by much the same token, but more personal and humanized, Rule 8:  Tell The TruthOr At Least, Dont Lie.  Deceit leads to evil, which leads to, and is embodied, suffering.

Rule 9 tells us to Assume That The Person You Are Listening To Might Know Something You Dont.  Here a plea for, in essence, humility, along with some fascinating ideas about how to conduct disagreements with ones spouse, and related thoughts on memory and wisdom.  Rule 10 says Be Precise In Your Speech.  As I say, Peterson embodies this rule.  I like to say (which probably says something about me), in the context of political arguments, that I am a professional killer.  I have nothing on Peterson, though.  You can see the wheels turning when he is asked a question, and what comes out is precise and irrefutable, each word weighted with meaning and exquisitely interlocked, intertwining and supporting, with every other.  (He never seems to say um, thats for certain.)  Lack of precision leads to chaos; lack of precision may be a failure of vocabulary, but it is more often a failure to communicate at all, to identify and address problems between two people before they grow to enormous, malevolent proportions.  But, If we speak carefully and precisely, we can sort things out, and put them in their proper place, and set a new goal, and navigate to itoften communally, if we negotiate; if we reach consensus.  If we speak carelessly and imprecisely, however, things remain vague.  The destination remains unproclaimed.  The fog of uncertainty does not lift, and there is no negotiating through the world.

Next to last, in Rule 11, Peterson returns to children, Do Not Bother Children When They Are Skateboarding.  Danger, especially for men, is part of growth.  And young men are the element of society at greatest risk todaythis is not a major theme of this book, but it is a major theme of Petersons public thought.  They are protected from developing properly, they are deliberately socialized like and as girls, yet they are blamed for the worlds ills, and as a result, some turn to nihilism, and fascism, encouraged by certain other men who, in essence, Peterson calls evil.

Here, Peterson returns emphatically to his proclamation of the deep and abiding differences between men and women.  [Some] insist, ever more loudly, that gender is a social construct.  It isnt.  This isn't a debate.  The data are in.  For example, in the emancipated Scandinavian countries, girls choose traditionally feminine pursuits and behaviors at extremely high rates.  And in the United States, it is just a lie that there are few women law firm partners due to discrimination; the reason is, purely, womens choice.  (I know this from personal experience, although you are forbidden to say it at a law firmyou would be fired instantly, yet another of many distortions of reality today, and a form of coerced lying and mass collective self-delusion.)  The dominance hierarchy is only one example of this, but it is enormously important, like it or not, for young men, and making it so they cant win in any aspect of it is catastrophic for menand for women, who have a reduced selection of competent partners to meet their different, but complementary, needs.

The movie Frozen is deeply propagandistic, an embodied falsehood, not because a woman necessarily needs a man to rescue her, though she probably does to some extent, as does a man need a woman to make him whole, but because it pretends that masculine traits are of no consequence to human flourishing.  The oppression of the patriarchy is a pack of lies.  The so-called oppression of the patriarchy was instead an imperfect collective attempt by men and women, stretching over millennia, to free each other from privation, disease and drudgery.  The miserable result of denying this is what we see today.  We do not teach our children that the world is flat.  Neither should we teach them unsupported ideologically-predicated theories about the nature of men and womenor the nature of hierarchy.  He even boldly directly attacks transgender ideology.  Gender is constructed, but an individual who desires gender re-assignment surgery is to be unarguably considered a man trapped in a womans body (or vice versa). The fact that both of these cannot logically be true, simultaneously, is just ignored.

The answer is simple.  Rather than feeding or believing all these lies, men and women should each do, and be, what they are.  A woman should look after her childrenalthough that is not all she should do.  And a man should look after a woman and childrenalthough that is not all he should do.  But a woman should not look after a man, because she must look after children, and a man should not be a child.  This means he must not be dependent.  In this is found what men should do, not in a turn to nihilism or fascism, and equally not in a turn to emasculation and feminization to avert stupid accusations of toxic masculinity.

Finally, in Rule 12, Pet A Cat When You Encounter One On The Street, Peterson turns most personal, describing the trials and suffering of his daughter from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  It is moving stuff, and Peterson returns again to his theme of the inevitability of suffering.  But being open to cats, and myriad other joys, means you can get a reminder that for just fifteen seconds that the wonder of Being might make up for the ineradicable suffering that accompanies it.

Peterson ends with a series of fascinating brief questions and answers, along with short explanations of the answers, posed from himself to himself, on everything from What shall I do with my life? (Answer: Aim for Paradise, and concentrate on today), to What shall I do with a torn nation? (Answer: Stitch it back together with careful words of truth), to What shall I do with my infants death? (Answer: Hold my other loved ones and heal their pain).  These are meant to, in a type of stream of consciousness, embody some of the basic principles underlying the rules in the book.  Really, though, they are more; they are nearly an entire philosophy of life, which is probably why this book is so popular.  If you are broken, there is much in it for you.  But Petersons point is that everyone is broken, sometimes more, sometimes lessso there is something in this book for everyone.",1521763200,5,friend mine push look jordan peterson past six month thought sinc friend conserv peterson offer rightw polit true recent news thought certain charg topic howev peterson fact offer polit refresh day rage rather 12 rule life selfhelp book construct like russian matryoshka doll nest construct talk work multipl level may polit implic incident book offer human person broken whole nest complex natur book realli surpris peterson life work studi infinit layer human mind one earlier book map mean exhaust analysi intric human myth root moral belief implic today peterson view moral tradit root exemplif explic opposit order chao well way creat share belief immens valuabl human societi basic point rule everi individu avoid extrem menac chao tyrann order follow way line order chao willing everyon shoulder burden take heroic path live properli collect flourish thu 12 rule guid end say polit book polit downstream bookthat buy

31575,33,3427,"This is an excellent book, my only criticism is that there is a bit too much of an attempt to discuss other countries and too little about the current US. As expected, some of the negative reviewers here try to make a point about the US being a republic, not a democracy. This is a bogus and illiterate claim made by people who failed high school government class. A republic is a democracy, a type of democracy. In fact most democracies are republics. From Wikipedia:
""In American English, the definition of a republic refers specifically to a form of democracy in which elected individuals represent the citizen body[2] and exercise power according to the rule of law under a constitution, including separation of powers with an elected head of state, referred to as a constitutional republic[4][5][6][7] or representative democracy.""

The authors are trying to build a case against our current President and argue for what can be done to get rid of him and repair the damage he will have done. They do a decent job of this. Their prescription for solving our problems is to have a social policy agenda of universalistic programs like northern Europe (social democracies) -- comprehensive health insurance, raising the minimum wage, a universal basic income, family policy, more comprehensive labor policies.

Of the other hackers that show up in Medieval England, the men tend to stay there, while the women travel further back in time to live in Atlantis. This means there are very few women in the book, which probably explains the juvenile poop and staff jokes.

I enjoyed the Kindle in Motion aspect.  I believe it adds a little bit to the story. The Audible version was good enough, nothing spectacular.

Both because Ive enjoyed OFarrells novels and because seventeen seemed like a really big number. OFarrell has lead an interesting life, often touched by tragedy. Her brushes with death began as a young child when she suddenly became afflicted with a rare neurological condition that left her unable to walk or even talk for nearly a year. The after effects left OFarrells body weakened and vulnerable, but her spirit strong and determined. In easy, compelling prose she shares experience that range from near drownings, to dangerous encounters with strangers, to bizarre parasites picked up in China, to bleeding out during a misguided c-section. Her experiences were always interesting, sometimes terrifying, and often heartbreaking. She made me reconsider my own brushes with death and what I might count. It seems Ive lived a luckier life than OFarrell, as at the most I can only find four. Whether or not youve experienced your own brushes with death, I Am, I Am, I Am will make you look at life a little differently.

31602,3975,1380,"Alias Grace is the semi-fictionalized story of Grace Marks, Canada's most notorious murderess of the 19th Century. Her story was sensationalized at the time, and Atwood takes this sensationalism to explore a supernatural explanation to Grace Marks' loss of memory during the murders of her master Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery. Atwood digs into her fictional Grace through a psychologist, Dr. Simon Jordan, after Grace has been in prison for fifteen years. She tells her story while we see how she lives in prison while working the Prison's Governor's home. Dr. Jordan's story is also told, and we see how desperately he wants to believe that he can figure her out and fix her so that he can legitimize his work. The key to unlocking Grace's memory is Mary Whitney, an old friend who died too young. But how can a dead girl answer questions? In ways you couldn't imagine.

I'm still new to Margaret Atwood, but I was pretty disappointed in her storytelling here. Maybe it's because this wasn't the usual dystopian I'm used to from her, or maybe it's because I was expecting a bigger, better explanation. It took forever to get through the first 100 pages, but after that the story moved quickly.

31606,15,3791,"McNamaras book resurrects a cold case involving serial rapes and murders in California in the 1970s and 1980s that remain unsolved and the perpetrator  never apprehended.  In the hands of another writer, the material might have been clinical and dry, but McNamara brings the case starkly to life with skilled writing, voluminous research and vivid, chilling detail.  The reader feels the terror of the traumatized and McNamaras empathy.  She is a journalist and a natural sleuth, doggedly determined to catch the man she dubbed the Golden State Killer.  She reviews the tangled maze of evidence, convinced that an overlooked suspect or innocuous clue is hidden in a file box or in retracing the crime scenes.  McNamara immerses herself in every aspect of the case, combing databases and archives, interviewing some of the past victims and befriending seasoned detectives.  I found this to be particularly compelling.  McNamaras exhaustive attention to the case was so extensive, that current and retired investigators in CA law enforcement saw her as an equal, trusted partner in trading insights and case information.  That alone is a testament to McNamaras tenacity, commitment and integrity as a writer and a seeker of the truth.  She shared the same obsession as those who still work tirelessly, decades later, to resolve the disturbing crime spree.
 Sadly, McNamara died before the completion of this book.  It stands on its own as a well-written, riveting true-crime tale, but the reader is left wondering what McNamaras finished product might have been.  I didn't find the book to be disorganized, disjointed or boring as other reviewers have said.  On the contrary, I found it to be an engrossing, compulsive read that captured the horror that once relentlessly besieged Californians.  I wish McNamara could have seen her work come to fruition, in both the book success and the capture of the elusive criminal.",1521763200,5,mcnamara book resurrect cold case involv serial rape murder california 1970 1980 remain unsolv perpetr never apprehend hand anoth writer materi might clinic dri mcnamara bring case starkli life skill write volumin research vivid chill detail reader feel terror traumat mcnamara empathi journalist natur sleuth doggedli determin catch man dub golden state killer review tangl maze evid convinc overlook suspect innocu clue hidden file box retrac crime scene mcnamara immers everi aspect case comb databas archiv interview past victim befriend season detect found particularli compel mcnamara exhaust attent case extens current retir investig ca law enforc saw equal trust partner trade insight case inform alon testament mcnamara tenac commit integr writer seeker truth share ob still work tirelessli decad later resolv disturb crime spree sadli mcnamara die complet book stand wellwritten rivet truecrim tale reader left wonder mcnamara finish product might didnt find book disorgan disjoint bore review said contrari found engross compuls read captur horror relentlessli besieg californian wish mcnamara could seen work come fruition book
31607,2382,3791,"My queen, Gillian Flynn, starts this book with a Midwestern twang and down-to-earth introduction; Patton Oswalt ends with a heart-rending final chapter and I was spellbound the entire time by Michelle McNamara's non-fiction novel.

A mind-blowing mountain of evidence to sift through and present in one novel only slightly frightened Michelle McNamara. What truly frightened her and kept her awake at night was the fact that the Golden State Killer has gotten away with his 10 year reign of terror and is possibly blending into society as someone's husband or dad now.

Yes, McNamara was obsessed with her search for the monster. If you read even a small item about this killer/rapist, I doubt you can remain content to leave it at that. It is impossibly frustrating in this day of DNA instant matching that the creep could still be walking the streets. She rightfully felt until the day she died that she was on the verge of identifying the killer, probably through an Ancestry.com like site.

A true-crime blogger, McNamara knew she was obsessed with GSK and does not hold back the introspective criticism. She knows herself and she understands people on a level that most of us don't. The seasoned and weary criminalists on the case came to appreciate, even rely on her skills. She, in turn, relied heavily on crowd-sourcing and advanced technology to help in the relentless search.

She writes impressively about the victims, the survivors and the detectives involved. She articulates the many (50) cases in bite-sized chunks and does not glorify nor hold back the details. It is a terrifying book, yet full of compassion and understanding for the victims.

My mouth continually fell open and my head was shaking NO as I listened to this moving account from one woman with an enormous investigation to relate to the public. It is simply a magnificent piece of work. The audio narration is AMAZING, but I still ended up buying the Kindle version to look at the maps and other evidence she has pictured.",1521763200,5,queen gillian flynn start book midwestern twang downtoearth introduct patton oswalt end heartrend final chapter spellbound entir time michel mcnamara nonfict novel mindblow mountain evid sift present one novel slightli frighten michel mcnamara truli frighten kept awak night fact golden state killer gotten away 10 year reign terror possibl blend societi someon husband dad ye mcnamara ob search monster read even small item killerrapist doubt remain content leav imposs frustrat day dna instant match creep could still walk street right felt day die verg identifi killer probabl ancestrycom like site truecrim blogger mcnamara knew ob gsk hold back introspect critic know understand peopl level u dont season weari criminalist case came appreci even reli skill turn reli heavili crowdsourc advanc technolog help relentless search write impress victim survivor detect involv articul mani 50 case bite chunk glorifi hold back detail terrifi book yet full compass understand victim mouth continu fell open head shake listen move account one woman enorm
31608,1604,3791,"My Thoughts: Ill Be Gone in the Dark is really two stories. The first, a gruesome tale of dozens of rapes and multiple murders over a span of ten years, and the man who committed them. The second, a womans near obsessive desire to find that man and unmask The Golden State Killer. The fact that these two fascinating narratives are so tightly woven together makes for unforgettable reading and a whole new take on true crime writing. Listening to the details of this mans crimes left me a little haunted and also with a creepy feeling of being a voyeur witnessing others suffering. I didn't want to know, but I couldn't stop listening. Equally captivating were McNamara and the many others investigating crimes more than twenty-five years after theyd occurred. In that time span DNA testing had grown much more refined and internet advances could now helped anyone visit crime scenes from the comfort of their own homes, giving hope to finally identifying the killer. Working with police detectives, cold crime investigators, and the FBI, McNamara followed the trail of this cold-blooded killer only to reach dead-ends time after time. Sadly, McNamara died in her sleep before she could complete this book. The remainder was pieced together from her many notes, articles, and blog posts. For Michelle, the many victims, their families and the tireless law enforcement investigators I hope someday The Golden State Killer will be found. Grade: B

Audio/Narration: Gabra Zackman did a great job narrating a difficult book. The story had many different people in it and lots of conversations. She made those easy to follow and delivered the story with ease. I will say that given the choice, Id recommend reading Ill Be Gone in the Dark over listening to it. There was quite a bit of jumping around in time and location and many different investigators involved. Had I been reading the book, Id more easily have had the ability to look back and clarify confusion that arose from time to time.

31615,235,3280,"What a truly fantastic read by what has to be my favourite crime writer; Michael Connelly. What is it about his style, what is it about his writing that makes a character so real, so unbelievably complex yet so dedicated who truly believes ""Everybody counts or nobody counts."" Bosch working with the unsolved crimes unit is looking into historic cases that were never resolved, in this particular instance the murder of Lily Price some 20 years previous. Added to this he has been requested, by his long-time rival Councilman Irvin Irving, to help apprehend the murderer of his son George.  There is so much that is ""human"" about Harry Bosch constantly working as a lone maverick and ignoring advice or guidance from his immediate superior or his present partner David Chu. Harry is so arrogant so impossible to work with, a maverick who always seems to read and understand the facts before anyone else and thus identify the culprit.

Irvin Irving has especially requested Bosch to find the truth behind his son's death, no matter how painful that truth may be. Irving has no love for Harry but he knows that this wily experienced detective will surely uncover the story behind his son's suggested suicide. Meanwhile the historic search for the killer of Lily Price will lead Bosch on a journey into the mind of an evil predator where depravity knows no bounds. Add to this the emergence of Harry's daughter Maddie into adulthood, and a timely long overdue love interest then we have all the ingredients for a wonderful read. Michael Connelly brings to life the daily pressure and decisions that are a constant occurrence for the officers within the LAPD.....""Every Cop knew that quietly carrying the horrors of the job inside could be like carrying untreated cancer""....

I should know better than to pick book #14 in a series but I like Christine Feehan so I picked Covert Games. Readers who've read previous books will certainly not have this problem.

Freehan writes imaginative stories with intriguing characters though and I'm glad I stuck with this book. I like that the Ghostwalkers are humans as we know it but they're not exactly paranormals either. They're just superhumans which was an interesting touch.

The story is gritty. Lots of unpleasant situations (cringe-worthy and stomach-churning !) and horrible characters (by design is not badly written) of the sort you never want to meet in real life and make for tense, suspenseful action.

Gino is sexy and demanding and someone comes off as caring instead of controlling which was good. I found Zara surprisingly identifiable, very surprisingly. At some level, even the strongest of women can find themselves hoping for a guy to make her life easier by taking charge. Archaic and anti-feminist as that may seem.

31657,1373,292,"I read Homegoing to fulfill the prompt of a book by an author of a different ethnicity than you for the 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge.

It took me a few days to process this book and what I thought about it before sitting down to write this review. That would be one thing I could say for it: it makes you think.

Homegoing begins as the story of two half-sisters, born in Ghana and each oblivious to the others existence. One remains in the country in a semi-privileged life that she never wanted, and the other is sold into slavery. The narrative structure is set up to follow one character per chapter, and one generation per pair of chapters (the half-sisters stories are told during the first two chapters, the next two chapters belong to their children, the next two to their grandchildren, and so on. Because of the way the story is set up, I would recommend reading two chapters at a time (chapters are not that long: 20-30 pages each) so you can compare and contrast the lives of each generation during roughly the same time period in different parts of the world.

For a short bookjust over 300 pagesHomegoing does a great job of introducing the characters, telling you the important parts of their stories, then moving on to the next generation, while making the characters sympathetic and relatable. The effect is almost that of reading a series of intertwined vignettes that are all related to a central theme: the effects of slavery on families and countries.

I didn't really have a favorite character in the novel, but I felt for every one of them. The theme is heavy, dark, but ultimately not without hope.

I can imagine there are some readers who will be put off by the narrative structure, and the fact that this is a multi-generational historical novel that isn't bloated by another 300 pages, but this writing is simply tight and packs a punch. For me, it is a novel I will think about for years to come.

31660,3603,3831,"Plum Tea Crazy by Laura Childs.

Although this is my 18th book read in this series this will be my 9th review. It should be obvious since I've continued reading this series throughout it's duration thus far that I truly enjoy the book(s) as well as the characters. I'd like to disclose a bit more of what motivates me to carry on in the Tea Shop series.

I want to be there, not just find the characters realistic or the setting pleasant, which they both are. I just plain want to enter the Indigo Tea Shop; to pass by the large baskets specially made for Theodosia's Tea Bath sets, to be led to a table near the back window by Theodosia herself. To enjoy the pleasant company of Drayton while he informs me of the tea selection that would go with each course as well as it's history. The place settings I would love to dwell on and observe the decor with wreaths adorned with lovely cups around the room. Yes, I would be amiss if I didn't include Haley's delectable scones...home made and baked in the perfect kitchen just her size. All these wonderful ingredients (include the Tea Shop characters) add up to my desire to be there.

Theodosia and Drayton are forced to stand idly by while they watch in horror as a man plunges to his death. This horrific scene takes place while they're attending the Gaslights & Galleons Parade on the widow's walk from the mansion of Drayton's longtime friend, timothy Neville. Upon a closer look Theodosia observes an even more sinister start to this poor man's demise.

The list of suspects widens and the reasons for his murder deepens as Theo & Drayton endeavor to get to the bottom of this murder.

Excellent reading that kept me focused and drew me in to the thick of it.

The authors ability to weave together a tale that blends the past with the present so seamlessly is nothing short of exquisite. Sometimes an author can get lost in the space between a story that spans so many years, but St. James brought it to life. The craftsmanship behind the writing, the broad spectrum of characters, and the richness in the quality story made me want to slow down as I was reading so that I could make it last just a bit longer.

31668,2354,3901,"Twenty years ago, Fiona's sister was found dead on the grounds of the abandoned girls school and Fiona has never been sure that the right person went to jail for the murder. Now, journalist Fiona is writing about the restoration of Idlewild Hall and she's on site when the body of another girl is found in the well. Fiona's story is now about much more than the restoration of a few old spooky buildings as she searches for the girl's identity, history and killer. Perhaps as she investigates, she will also find what really happened to her sister.

In 1950, four misfit girls at Idlewild Hall were put together as roommates. They've heard the rumors that the school is haunted but become more convinced as they each have experiences to confirm the presence of a ghost. They resolve to protect one another until the day one of the girls disappears.

It was fun to read another ghost story so soon. I read The Broken Girls by Simone St. James late a night after the house was quiet and the kids had gone to bed. The blend of an eerie ghost story with a contemporary crime drama was one that really did appeal at the end of the day and I felt like it worked well in this novel. St. James pulls the reader right in with freaky prologue. The setting of Idlewild Hall draws on the very unsettling nature of boarding schools and their long established function in literature as a scary place. Make that boarding school abandoned, and it's that much more spooky. St. James uses the setting and the haunting to keep her characters and the reader off balance and it works well.

The Broken Girls goes back and forth between Fiona's investigation and the girls at Idlewild. It does so seamlessly and keeps the plot lines going at a steady and dramatic pace. There is a constant threat of looming danger and it is successful for a thriller. I really enjoyed The Broken Girls. It's a quick read that I didn't want to put down once I started.",1521849600,4,twenti year ago fiona sister found dead ground abandon girl school fiona never sure right person went jail murder journalist fiona write restor idlewild hall she site bodi anoth girl found well fiona stori much restor old spooki build search girl ident histori killer perhap investig also find realli happen sister 1950 four misfit girl idlewild hall put togeth roommat theyv heard rumor school haunt becom convinc experi confirm presenc ghost resolv protect one anoth day one girl disappear fun read anoth ghost stori soon read broken girl simon st jame late night hous quiet kid gone bed blend eeri ghost stori contemporari crime drama one realli appeal end day felt like work well novel st jame pull reader right freaki prologu set idlewild hall draw unsettl natur board school long establish function literatur scari place make board school abandon much spooki st jame use set haunt keep charact reader balanc work well broken girl goe back forth fiona investig girl idlewild

This is a mystery, within a mystery, within a mystery.  There is a murder years before, a current murder, and a missing teenager within this story.  They all work together and each bring an interesting plot line.

The one thing I did not really like is some of the information is repeated/recapped.  An example of this would be some of the video evidence within the older murder.  We hear about with Casey and then again get the whole recap though Dylan.  I do not like when these things are told over and over again since we already have the information and I feel it is just filler.

I ended up reading this in one sitting.  The second half of the book had me at the edge of my seat.  I flew through it.  I wanted to go to bed, but I knew I had to finish this first.  This does end with so many questions, so I am happy I plan to binging this series and will be starting book two next.

31681,703,698,"This is the first book in a series of books that tell the tale of a Witcher and a child of prophecy along with oh so much more!
This first book is the set up and foundation for the entire tale. It's jam packed with so many names of people, places, types of magics and things... just everything that makes up a fantasy series. It's the book that starts it all off so it's the hardest book to rate in many ways. In some ways it boggles the mind in some parts because you are given so many names of Kings and Lords and higher and lower royals or just those important enough to be worthy of mentioning in talks when plans are being laid for the upcoming battles and so on. You must learn and keep in mind the different people and places, etc. Of course, you don't really need to remember them all as they will be mentioned enough if they were important enough but as you are first hearing of everything it can seem quite the task. So, once you get all of that straight and read between those things and get to the story of Ciri, Geralt, and the close knit group associated with the ""good"" guys if you will (for the sake of shortening what could be a very long ramble when trying not to give anything away) the story falls nicely into place and by the end you can see exactly where the next,  5 or 6 is it?, books are going.
I'm not going to give the story away. I think the book gives enough information about what is to come and it's good to just jump right in and get going. There are two other books in the series that are more or less stories within the stories of the main books. I only read one of those but wanted to get right into the main books. I haven't ever played the games either so can't say anything about how the books and games would be at all.
Alright. All that said and done. I'm sorry for the review being a bit all over and not giving much about the book. It was terribly hard for me to review.

31684,1109,1681,"I find stories that have bad guys versus good guys simplistic and rather irritating. I generally try to avoid them. As a result, I read many books where the bad guys motive is moving and heartbreaking. Sometimes I read a book, hating the villain until the last chapter, just to read about their past and fall in love with them. In books like these, the line between the good and the bad blurs. I find myself wondering, Who is the hero? Who is the villain?

The Outsiders, a coming-of-age novel written by Susan Hinton, is the story of fourteen-year-old Ponyboy Curtis. Ponyboy lives in what is supposed to be Tulsa, Oklahoma (although this is not stated in the book), where there are only two kinds of people: the penniless greasers (Ponyboy is one of these) and the wealthy Socs (short for Socials). But when one of Ponyboys greaser friends kills a Soc in self-defense, Ponyboy finds himself on the run. In the turmoil that ensues, Ponyboy struggles to find his place in the world.

Ponyboy Curtis is not a typical greaser. An orphan in an already troubled home, Ponyboy spends as much time as he can outside. He lives with his two older brothers, Darrel and Sodapop. Sodapop and Darrel both work in order to survive, and this often leads to strife and frustration. When the boys jump outside one day to join a fight, Ponyboy and the others describe themselves as menaces to society, hoodlums, and other names. But as Ponyboy begins to find out more about himself, he begins to doubt his self-assigned identity.

From the beginning of the book, greasers and Socs are portrayed as complete opposites of each other. But as the story progresses, this view of the dynamics between the Socs and the Greasers begins to show flaws. Greasers often have troubled pasts, and they end up living on the streets. As a result, greasers are fiercely loyal and aren't scared of a fair fight, even though the Socs always win. But despite the Socs money and fancy cars, Ponyboy begins to see hurt, desperate boys standing where he thought monsters stood.

The Outsiders is an intense, thought-provoking story. With its relatable characters and heartbreaking situations, The Outsiders left me staring at the cover with questions swirling inside my head. Who was the villain in this story? I wondered. Or were they all heroes?

31685,1181,3580,"This choppy historical novel is supposedly a fictionalized account of the real Charley Parkhurst, a noted stagecoach driver in the mid-19th century in California, but largely consists of several loosely connected scenarios across his life that are sketchy and don't seem particularly believable. The central character in this book undoubtedly had a most difficult life, having been raised in an orphanage not noted for kind treatment of the kids. Fortunately for her, she learned to care for horses and driving of carts with multiple horse teams. In the authors telling, it was a horrific attack on a black man with whom she was living that led her to change her identity to a man and travel to California in her mid-thirties. The author has Parkhurst driving a stage until her death at age 68, which apparently is a stretch.

It is highly debatable as to whether this book really captures the real Parkhurst; there seems to be many contrived events. It does show the chaos of the times and how precarious life was in the 19th century. Of course, there was no understanding of differences in people, especially in race and gender.

31688,893,30,"Maybe youve never heard of this book (or the 1963 movie). Try the book first. Its sustained drama shames the movie. Half of the movie is about boys in tattered clothing running through the forestthats not what Lord of the Flies is all about.
The briefest possible summary: a transoceanic flight loaded with young British schoolboys crashes near an uninhabited island. The surviving boys (no adults) struggle to create and maintain a primitive civitas. They fail. Their attempt at the simplest kind of self-government is wrecked by a cohort of boys who are persuaded by the charismatic, sociopathic Jack to indulge their inclinations to hedonism and barbarism. Ralphs idealistic efforts to establish order are fruitless. Jacks hunters end up killing two of their fellows before the grown-ups arrive to rescue them.
Goldings Lord of the Flies leads any defender of the common good to despair of civilized behavior that benefits all.

p.s. there are painfully disturbing similarities between Lord of the Flies and Shantung Compound: The Story of Men and Women Under Pressure (give this one a try, too).

31693,1303,458,"It's 1980-something, and Frank is struggling to keep his beloved record shop open. He loves music and has a knack for knowing exactly the right tune a person needs to hear the moment he meets them, but unfortunately his quirky talent isn't paying the bills. Located on a dead-end street with other shops that are just as derelict as his own, Frank's store is losing money, month after month, due to fewer customers and, lately, increased crime. It doesn't help that Frank absolutely refuses to sell CDs, which he considers a passing fad, and will only stock vinyl records...that nobody seems to want.

Frank is young---mid-thirties at most---but he's very isolated. Still grieving the death of his mother from many years earlier, he prefers to keep his distance and avoid the pain of close relationships. Well, that's the plan, anyway, until a beautiful stranger in a green coat randomly passes out in front of his shop one day. It takes Frank some time to figure out her story, but after meeting Ilse, Frank is changed. He's still scared to pursue a relationship with this new person, but he also can't seem to quite shake his feelings of, well, love. As Frank tries to understand and cope with this unfamiliar situation, he must also figure out a way to keep his shop open and out of the clutches of a big shot developer who can't wait to raze his store to the ground.

* * * * *

I had high hopes for this book, but it ended up being just okay. I love the quirkiness of Frank and some of the other characters, but, unfortunately, their endearing eccentricities couldn't distract me from the slow pace of the story and the odd, manufactured drama between Frank and Ilse. The book had such a great start but then took forever togo somewhere already. I also didn't think the flashbacks to Frank's time with his unconventional mother, Peg, were that interesting either.

Truthfully, I think author Rachel Joyce got so caught up in making a ""story about music!"" that she forgot to make a good story. I felt a connection to Frank, but Peg and Ilse, the two main women in his life, fell completely flat and never seemed like real people to me. So ultimately,The Music Shop has a fun premise but a boring and underdeveloped story. I'd skip it.

Nimona is this unapologetic, excited girl with totally unexplained superpowers.  She's a shapeshifter, or a skin changer, or... well honestly who cares because Sir Blackheart's evil career needs some serious boosting and HERE COMES NIMONA.

This graphic novel is a really well thought-out story about a girl who is lost, two old friends forced by the Institution to be enemies, and a system in power too busy entertaining its own ideas to worry about its people.  There's deep sentiment and delightful silliness in the panels.  I really enjoyed it.

As a graphic novel, it's brief.  The characters and world aren't really as well developed as in a novel.  That said, for the little slice of life you get to see them, they're delightful. I certainly wish there were additional volumes, but Nimona is based on a webcomic.  I love the characters' fears and struggles, and enjoyed trying to spot Nimona in various panels.

Many of the best scenes were ""filler"" - moments where Nimona is complaining about sardines in pizza or hiding in Blackhart's cape from a scary movie.

31711,4306,3886,"The story behind the story is that Amy Tan was inspired to write The Valley of Amazement after finding some photographs that indicated her grandmother had been one of the high class courtesans of Shanghai in years before World War I. Perhaps the fact that she was speculating about her grandmother caused the author to be too circumspect. I cannot recommend The Valley of Amazement to Ms Tans many admirers or to those looking for their first read.

As a fan I had been looking forward to this novel. Ms Tan is at her best telling tales of mother and daughters clashing and learning as history and generations and cultures bring them into conflict and reconciliation. The Valley of Amazement promised to include all of her strengths and give her an excuse to be naughty.

Instead she does not commit to her story. The sex, is not sexy. Dangers are almost never dangerous. All of her female characters have too many excuses and her males range from scoundrels to very good; only one is worse than merely unpleasant. The result is a complex interweaving of bland people experiencing an exotic if bland life.

For most of the book the protagonist is Violet. The child of an American mother and owner of the highest, high class house of courtesans of Shanghai just 1900. Courtesans not prostitutes. These women are sex workers, but their Johns, must court them and pay dearly for the fantasy that the men have seduced their way into the bed of their favorites.

Violet grows up a spoiled, self-center brat and by about page 20 we know she is not going to have a life only as a protected, observer of life among the flowers (Working women).

In a few pages her otherwise astute mother is tricked by one of her least reliable gentlemen. Violet is kidnapped and sold into sexual bondage. In about 1 paragraph, the spoiled child accepts her new role and excels at it. Her virginity is sold to a man who is exactly the man she hopes would have the best bid and so she become an active sex worker on something like her terms.

And so for hundreds of pages life goes on. Mostly to no particular purpose except to say that Violet lives a comparatively reasonable life. Yeah she has to have sex with men, but the pay is good and the conditions better. There are references to the horrible conditions of less popular sex workers and that life in China could be worse than miserable, but rarely does any of that touch our Violet.

If you manage to stay awake long enough to reach the last 150 or so pagers we share Violets one adventure into a non-protected world, but it does not last long and then we get to hear about life through her mothers eyes. Surprise, mom also has a back story.

I almost came to like the last 100 pages. The quality of the writing seemed to get better. Except, Ms Tan seemed to be marking time, letting years pass to no particular purpose except to allow her to come up with reasons why characters can delay decisions and opt for needlessly complex maneuvers.

My impression was that Ms Tan wanted to imagine what life could have been like for her grandmother. But if this Violet is supposed to be a relation, then it would not be polite to have this person suffer real suffering. Her humiliations must be passed over quickly and of course her sex life must be handled delicately. Nothing is ever truly bad, or good and I had very little sense of being in a world remote and unknown. Most of Violets world is limited to well decorated and managed rooms. The sex is present to the degree as to make the book a poor choice for the young or the bedroom adverse, but never erotic. It is regarded as a mostly mechanical process for the labor force, but never even as tedious as factory work. Violet has several opportunities to get out of The Life but is content to let events coast. She invents reasons why she cannot accept advantageous offers. This hardly makes her a strong woman in charge of her life. Her response to being a victim is as passive as her response to good fortune. Violent is not much more than a survivor with very little independence or strength to inspire our admiration.",1521849600,2,stori behind stori ami tan inspir write valley amaz find photograph indic grandmoth one high class courtesan shanghai year world war perhap fact specul grandmoth caus author circumspect cannot recommend valley amaz m tan mani admir look first read fan look forward novel m tan best tell tale mother daughter clash learn histori gener cultur bring conflict reconcili valley amaz promis includ strength give excus naughti instead commit stori sex sexi danger almost never danger femal charact mani excus male rang scoundrel good one wors mere unpleas result complex interweav bland peopl experienc exot bland life book protagonist violet child american mother owner highest high class hous courtesan shanghai 1900 courtesan prostitut woman sex worker john must court pay dearli fantasi men seduc way bed favorit violet grow spoil selfcent brat page 20 know go life protect observ life among flower work woman page otherwis astut mother trick
31712,894,3850,"Hmmm, how to start... its been a while since Ive read the other books, so I could probably use a refresher but Ill try my best with this.

What I didn't like:  This book felt too short, like there was so much that could have been done with it but the author didn't have time to because she was too busy focusing on the drama between Warner and Juliette. The old characters in the story were barely here, aside from Kenji and Castle. I wanted more on Warner and Adam and James, but they had barely any interaction in this story. Warner and Adam talked briefly for one chapter and thats it. Adam barely makes an appearance otherwise. I wanted to see them try to grow a relationship and interact, but that didn't happen. The bit of strength Juliette gained at the end of the last book seems to have gone here. She is completely unprepared for the job shes taken on - embarrassingly floundering in many aspects of it - and reverts back to being uncertain and scared and her sanity seems to worsen. She begins doubting Warner and everything that grew between them. And when she finds things out about his past she flips her lid. Her compassion for him has almost vanished, despite his attempts to make her happy. For as much abuse as she knows he has suffered, expecting him to spill his guts to her about his past all at once is unrealistic. Castles character because less admirable after we discover he knew certain things (no spoilers) and did nothing about them. Just apparently lived with the knowledge and did nothing to try correcting it. The plot twist were thrown here really didn't surprise me all that much. There are 2 sex scenes in here which required skipping a few pages. A few things about Warner/done by him seemed a bitttttt out of character for him but I won't say what because of spoilers. Clich Russian girl who is vicious and blonde and pale skinned. Brief appearance of apparent trans-in-progress character, that is mocked by said Russian.

What I did like: Getting every other chapter from Warners POV was awesome, and his and Kenjis interaction was hysterical.

Will be waiting for the next Novella to see where it all goes from here.",1521849600,3,hmmm start sinc ive read book could probabl use refresh ill tri best didnt like book felt short like much could done author didnt time busi focus drama warner juliett old charact stori bare asid kenji castl want warner adam jame bare interact stori warner adam talk briefli one chapter that adam bare make appear otherwis want see tri grow relationship interact didnt happen bit strength juliett gain end last book seem gone complet unprepar job she taken embarrassingli flounder mani aspect revert back uncertain scare saniti seem worsen begin doubt warner everyth grew find thing past flip lid compass almost vanish despit attempt make happi much abus know suffer expect spill gut past unrealist castl charact le admir discov knew certain thing spoiler noth appar live knowledg noth tri correct plot twist thrown realli didnt surpris much 2 sex scene requir

31725,4213,20,"Little Fires Everywhere isn't like any book I've read before, but I liked it quite a bit. It had some valuable lessons in it, for people of all ages.

When you start the book, you enter a suburbia of sorts, where life is perfect, and the people all pretty much the same. Then comes in Mia Warren and her daughter, Pearl, who don't quite fit the mold. Mrs. Richardson decides to give them an apartment at a low cost, without realizing how much would change with them coming into town.

Rich characters and deep themes create this book to be one that you can't quite forget about when it's over. I have a feeling I'll be thinking about this one for quite a while, and wondering what happened to the characters after the book was over. That, to me, implies a great author; one who can create such realistic characters that even after the book is over, you wonder what happened to them. Even though you know technically they never have existed in this world.

Little Fires Everywhere had quite a bit of hype around it, which always makes me nervous. However, after reading I understand that hype now. The only thing I thought was that it had quite a few story lines in it that made it somewhat difficult to follow. It starts out with a fire, and then backs all the way up to what led to that fire. Some of the stories throughout didn't seem relevant to the fire, but seemed to make the book stronger as a whole.

I only rated it down because I was able to not take it with me on my vacation and I wasn't upset about that or insistent upon finishing before my vacation, although I was quite close to finishing. Typically, for a book that I'm absolutely enthralled with and loving, I will finishing it within days. For this case, I kept putting it down and coming back to it later to finish it.

In a way I found it infuriating that every single person made assumptions and no one asked each other if they were right like every daytime soap opera ever  but I liked it for the same reasons as well.

The book began with the burning down of the Richardson family home which everyone assumed was done by black sheep and quick tempered Izzy. It then follows all the events leading up to present day. I gotta say Izzy was basically the most likable of the family. While all the characters were very much fleshed out, she was the only one who seemed to see the world as a big picture instead of what was only good for herself.

31729,2296,1967,"*Original review on Goodreads & My Blog*

I first watched the movie on Netflix and then I found out it was a book through some friends on Goodreads. Well, I had to run over to Amazon and buy the paperback! There were some things different in the movie of course but I'm glad those parts weren't in the book. I didn't really care for them and have no idea why they even though it up.

This is a creepy story of monsters and rituals and a big reason to not go into any place called The Black Woods. I don't care if one of your people hurt any part of their body. Taking a short cut through some creepy black forest you know nothing about is NOT THE THING TO DO PEOPLE!

But I loved it because it was weird, creepy and different, at least to me!

31736,10,733,"Ok, I finally read this one. Was really looking forward to a respite from the overwhelmingly serious and bleak books Ive been reading lately and you don't really think about turning to Scandinavian fiction for such a respite, seeing how the general region is mainly known for noir, precisely the serious and the bleak. Alas, this is something of a miracle then plus its a genuinely happy book that isn't infuriating and yes this covers the happiest ending since Downton Abbey too. And its centenarian protagonist is terrific. And his variegated life is terrific. And all the other characters on two or four legs are terrific. And the entire thing is a delight from start to finish. Seriously. Who knew this amount of whimsy would actually work. There is a sort of aggressive cheeriness going on, it is, after all, a book about a man who always looks on a bright side. This outlook and some astonishing twists and turns of fate take his around the world, from one country leader to another, affecting global politics and local crime scene with equal randomness.  So this isn't just a quirky tale of an old man who gets inadvertently involved in some regional criminality, this is also a great picaresque of a life that spans an entire century in the most incredible way. Frankly, I only expected the former, so I was very pleasantly surprised by the latter. It added a much welcome layer of historical comedy to enjoy in addition to all of the other Allan and the gangs shenanigans. Even if its all just a tall tale spun by a lonely old man, its so good, youll wish it real. The book is very well written and very funny and this varies from darkly humorous to slapstick. And its clever too, I very much enjoyed the way the narrative wove itself around the actual historical events or maybe vice versa. This book has certainly exceeded my reasonably high expectations in the best possible way. I enjoyed it tremendously and cant wait to see the cinematic adaptation.  And on a personal note, centenarians are great, get to know one if you can, its well worth it, once you get past the sheer amazement at a life lived so long, they really do have some great stories. Although probably none as wild as Allan Carlssons.  Awesome book.

31740,378,3787,"Winter Sisters by Robin Oliveira is the second book in the Mary Sutter series.  In Albany, New York in March of 1879 the ODonnell family heads out.  David to the lumber district, Bonnie to her millinery shop and the girls (Claire and Emma) to the grammar school.  That afternoon a horrible blizzard strikes the area. After the storm, David and Bonnie are both found dead.  Claire and Emma were released from school after the storm, but they never made it home.  Dr. Mary Sutter and her husband, William search for the girls, but they are unable to locate them.  Mary routinely visits the police station, but Captain Arthur Mantel urges her to give up her quest.  If the girls have not been found by now, they are presumed dead.  Mary is not about to give up that easily.  What happened to the ODonnell girls?

While the Winter Sisters is the second book in the series, it can be read alone.  My Name is Mary Sutter is summarized early in the Winter Sisters along with the history (backstory) of each main character. I like that the main character is a female doctor (such a rarity in that time period).  I found the pace to be lethargic which can be attributed to the abundant details and the authors formal (and descriptive) writing style.  The authors descriptions help readers visualize the scenes.  However, she needs to find a balance between not enough and too much.  I was amazed to find that the age of consent (for relations) for women was ten in New York (how sad and disturbing) in 1879.  The author included some fascinating historical information into the story which helped capture the era.  The attitude towards women by many men (but not all) was accurately portrayed.  The mystery was simple and easily solved before the answers are revealed.  Winter Sisters contains foul language as well as vivid descriptions of violence and child rape (described in graphic detail from a medical viewpoint by Dr. Sutter).  I read Winter Sisters, but I could not get into the story (it failed to hold my attention).  The ending wraps up all the storylines neatly and happily.

31742,1920,217,This is a mostly a collection of articles that Coates has written for The Atlantic Magazine over the past few years.  Most of them I had read already but it was interesting to read his introduction to each article and get his take on them in light of recent events.  The title comes from a speech that was made during the reconstruction era as it was ending the white rule/terrorism was being reinstated throughout the South.  What is so striking about it is that it is very easily a statement that could be made today.  That is the point of the book and the commentary on the essays in it.  It is kinda a more things change the more they stay the same story.  I think that the most poignant part of the book was the  epilogue where Coates takes on the view that it was somehow a forgotten White working class that brought Trump to power in this country and that to claim race was a factor in it is wrong and counterproductive.  Coates makes a strong argument that the election of Trump ( and Obama ) and the reaction that this nation had to their elections is inseparably tied up to race.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Coates's writing if you have missed some of his articles this is a good way to get caught up and if you have already read them the introductions and reflections he writes about them in light of recent events makes the book worth buying just on that.,1521849600,4,mostli collect articl coat written atlant magazin past year read alreadi interest read introduct articl get take light recent event titl come speech made reconstruct era end white ruleterror reinstat throughout south strike easili statement could made today point book commentari essay kinda thing chang stay stori think poignant part book epilogu coat take view somehow forgotten white work class brought trump power countri claim race factor wrong counterproduct coat make strong argument elect trump obama reaction nation elect insepar tie race highli recommend book anyon fan coatess write miss articl good way get caught alreadi read introduct reflect write light recent event make book worth buy

This gem of a book consisting of ten short stories is the first collection of shorts for author Curtis Sittenfeld, although she has authored five other books which I fully intend to read.  This is my first party with Ms. Sittenfeld and it certainly will not be my last.

The writing is so crisp and clean!  The characters are so down-to-earth, fleshed-out, and so like people you and I probably know.  The situations in each story are so true, realistic, and we have all felt how these characters have felt.  Sittenfeld has human nature down pat and everyone reading this collection can certainly relate in more ways than one to each character and their lives.

Everyone has favorites out of a collection ---

OFF THE RECORD -- Nina is a journalist and new mom and gets invited to interview a Hollywood actress.  In fact, she is personally requested for the interview by said movie star.  Join Nina as she struggles with motherhood, traveling with her baby, the actual interview, and her eye-opening revelations. Nina is a great character!

VOLUNTEERS ARE SHINING STARTS --  Frances volunteers at a safe house entertaining kids while their moms get a break.  Along with her many phobias and hang-ups, Frances is an odd little duck.  What happens when a new volunteer shows up and upsets Frances' apple cart?  This was an especially well written short; I really enjoyed Frances!

31746,904,3785,"You know you're 100% not into the book anymore when the book ends on a huge cliffhanger and you're like, well, eh, where was my green glowing Rasputin that never showed up?

This was one of my mostttttttttttttt anticipated books of 2018. It was one of my new favorite authors last year who created the masterpiece that was Geekerella that blended the Cinderella story with nerdy epicness and cons. When I heart Poston was taking on one of my favorite animated movies everrrrrrrrrrrrrr - Anastasia - in SPACE? MEETING FIREFLY? I was already crying.

Let me get out the retelling aspects out right now since literally all of my Goodreads updates were me trying to figure out where Rasputin was and who he was supposed to be. I guess I was expecting more Anastasia? Geekerella last year was full of cool, inventive takes on the original fairytale, and I guess I was expecting the same thing from this one. I was going into this story with it expecting it to be a retelling but with more of a Cinder feel to it? You're still having the things that happened in it but you still have more into the story with wars from evil peeps involved.

However, I think you should know this is not a full blown retelling. It's more like loosely based on. I don't know if was only ever supposed to be inspired by it, but I walked into this thinking it was going to be a retelling, and I was quite disappointed. I mean, yes, it does follow the whole overreaching plot of the whole lost princess thing, but it kind of took away a lot of the original plot of trying to convince the Grand Duchess of Ana's royalty and training her how to be a princess and such. I mean, Dmitri wasn't even the person to tell everyone that Ana was the person. I just felt a little jipped since it only took a few little things of the original story and put a whole new story in there. I JUST WANTED MY ANASTASIA STORY THAT I KNEW AND LOVED. I COULDN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT WHO WAS RASPUTIN. Since Anastasia is one of my ultimate loves (even though the poor gal isn't a Disney princess), I just felt a little misled by a few things walking into the story - probably from my own misguided expectations since the moment I saw Anastasia's name - and just wanted more.

OKAY, RANT DONE.

I do think Poston came up with such an inventive idea. I mean, she did take the main aspect of the Anastasia retelling and came up with a cool world. I liked the feel she created with this novel. I did sometimes struggle with the world building - it took me a ridiculously LONG time to figure out the HIVE thing - and I didn't even really understand if these people were on planets or how they were getting around or stuff like that. However, I think Poston did come up with cool, new things to the genre of sci-fi like the Solani and their powers. I liked the idea of The Great Dark as well, and the Iron stuff was pretty cool. But I was confused about a good deal of the world for a long time.

Poston still is a fantastic writer. She has such an ease with her writing. I mean, despite this being a 400+ page book, I sped through it in 3 days, since the flow and writing was just so easy to read. As I mentioned, there was a cool vibe to it, and the atmosphere she created was quite brilliant. I felt like I was in space, and even though it's hard for me to get into sci-fi, I felt invested in the novel because I liked the feel.

The characters were quite iffy. I mean, I didn't hate anyone, but I really didn't like anyone. We have four main characters/narrators, and I didn't feel anything for anyone. I suppose I liked Robb the best? I kept asking why everyone was hating on him, so I mean, I guess I felt the most for him. There were times that I did root someone on or felt bad for someone, but the most part, I felt nothing for them. Any feeling I had just felt surface level and didn't have any depth. I'm not entirely sure why I felt this way, but sometimes, I just felt like they were just a bit too...cliched? They didn't have little quirks that made them unique in my eyes. Jax felt like the cliche cocky, smartass captain while Ana felt like she was supposed to be the sassy, fierce special girl and Robb just felt like the conflicted hero. Di had a bit of a complexity to him that did feel different.

The romance was okay. I did prefer Jax's and Robb's romance to Ana's and Di's, but the Jax/Robb romance was totalllllllllll instalove. That took away some of the feels, but I did have some good feels for it. Ana and Di's ship was okay. Wasn't super into it, but I didn't hate it.

I definitely preferred the first part of the story's plot to the second part's. I thought it was super interesting when they were on the ship and working up to the middle part. Once the second part hit, I kind of didn't feel it as much as I was in the middle part. By the end, the action and pacing really ramped up, but I was kind of checked out by then. I think Poston did do good with creating tension and interesting twists and turns to pop up. However, I think the indifference I had for all of the characters really kind of made me not care what was happening and I didn't get the gravity of the situation. Something really intense happens at the end of the story and while it was something similar that happened in another book I read that I absolutely loved the characters (in which I was literally cringing/crying/all shocked faced), I barely blinked in this one.

Overall, this really wasn't the book I was expecting it to be. Poston is a very talented writer who did take another fairytale-esque story and make an interesting retelling. While it didn't have all of the aspects that I was looking for in it, she did create a unique world full of cool sci-fi vibes and good, easy writing with a nice flow and pacing. The romance wasn't bad, but I didn't feel anything for the characters. This book is a light read, and I think for those that are iffy with sci-fi, it would be a good book to read. However, it did have quite a few issues for me in just trying to get me to feel something for it.

31747,132,1637,"I admit it, I picked up this book because, as a librarian myself, books about librarians and bookstore owners/employees strike a chord with me.  And a book about a librarian-turned-bookstore-owner seemed right up my alley, especially given that it took place in a small town and promised some interesting encounters with said town's locales.  I went into this book expecting not much else beyond some cute fluff... and ended up getting about what I was promised.  And while not the greatest read ever, ""The Bookshop on the Corner"" (a.k.a. ""The Little Shop of Happy-Ever-After,"" its UK title) is a perfectly cozy read, sweet and light and with a cast of delightfully colorful characters.

Nina is a quiet and painfully shy librarian who nonetheless has a knack for matching potential readers up with the perfect book... and so it comes as a painful blow when the library is closed down, leaving her adrift.  Rather than apply at the new media center replacing her beloved library, though, she decides to leap out on a whim for once in her life... and purchases a van, fills it with books, and sets off for a tiny Scottish town to run her own mobile book shop.  Setting off to match up the perfect book for as many villagers as she can, she finds herself caught up in their lives -- her grumpy landlord in the throes of a turbulent divorce, a book-loving girl hiding secrets about her home life, and a sweet Eastern-European train engineer who leaves her poetry and trinkets in the branches of a tree near the train tracks.  And as Nina finds her place in rural-small-town Scotland, she ends up feeling like she's come home... and perhaps finds love in the process.

Colgan's writing can be a little too sweet and saccharine at times, and at times it feels like she's trying to hard to be witty.  But for the most part I enjoyed her writing style -- pleasant, just descriptive enough to give us a clear and lovely picture of her setting, and with a keen insight into the lives of her characters.  She gives us a colorful cast of characters, and I found myself enjoying them... and appreciating that Colgan gave them real flaws and backstories, opting for something a little more complex than your standard ""eccentric townsfolk.""  I did get somewhat tired of the bog-standard love triangle that reared its head throughout the story, and felt that the romantic subplot was rather cliche (please tell me I'm not the only one sick and tired of the old ""they start out hating each other so of course they'll fall in love later"" trope), but it wasn't enough to make me quit reading.

I'm also rather disappointed that Colgan describes some fantastic-sounding books that Nina recommends to people... but when I went to research said books, many of them turned out to be completely fictional.  And here I wanted to read ""Up On the Rooftops"" for myself and see what was so charming about it.  Maybe Colgan will get inspired to ""de-fictionalize"" some of these titles and write them herself?  I can hope so...  The book also comes with an introduction detailing Colgan's reading habits, which I personally wasn't interested in and can be skipped without detracting from the story.

Not an earth-shattering read by any means, but a light and cozy read that's perfect for taking along on a trip or curling up with on a rainy day.  If you're a book lover and like books about fellow book lovers, you'll probably enjoy ""The Bookshop on the Corner.""",1521849600,3,admit pick book librarian book librarian bookstor ownersemploye strike chord book librarianturnedbookstoreown seem right alley especi given took place small town promis interest encount said town local went book expect much el beyond cute fluff end get promis greatest read ever bookshop corner aka littl shop happyeveraft uk titl perfectli cozi read sweet light cast delight color charact nina quiet pain shi librarian nonetheless knack match potenti reader perfect book come pain blow librari close leav adrift rather appli new medium center replac belov librari though decid leap whim life purchas van fill book set tini scottish town run mobil book shop set match perfect book mani villag find caught live grumpi landlord throe turbul divorc booklov girl hide secret home life sweet easterneuropean train engin leav poetri trinket branch tree near train track nina find place ruralsmalltown scotland end feel like she come home perhap find love process colgan write littl sweet saccharin

I very much enjoyed being able to witness all--or should I say, SOME--of Mary's deepest and darkest secrets. It made things interesting in a slow-build read.

I knew the big secret right away, and maybe that was done on purpose because the author only chose to reveal it in the last few pages.

But I still was waiting for a big climax, for something to happen to make me cover my hand with my closed fist and got ""ohhhhh, shhhhhhh*****!"" It'd didn't come.
For me, the ending wasn't an ending at all.

Gunther, a chief detective who still regards the rule of law as his bible, must work in a macabre society where murder is overlooked for political expediency. Bernie proceeds in spite of and is irreverent to the point of insolence to such superiors as General Heydrich and Martin Borman, all in the pursuit of justice at any cost. This is one of the best historical novels and police procedural novels I have ever read. This is the kind of a book you savor and never want to end.

31751,1689,3826,"My Thoughts:
I love this author's works and this series has been fairly solid. So, I was a tad bit surprised that I didn't enjoy this book as much as previous installments.

Calvin returned home to Amish country because his brother was diagnosed with cancer. Upon his return, he meets Alice, a young woman living next door to his brother and sister-in-law. Immediately he was smitten with Alice. His desire to protect her and his concern for her seemed sudden to me. I tend to struggle with the insta-love trope in any book. And in this case, Calvin is an undercover DEA agent. So, it seemed to me that he would have been more guarded with his heart.

Alice was likewise interested in Calvin from the start. And then, her friend was also thrown into an insta-love situation with Calvin's boss in the gang. Which again, I had a hard time believing.

There wasn't much suspense for me in this book. The mystery of who ransacked Alice's classroom was fairly obvious and it surprised me that the suspect wasn't obvious to Alice or her friend.

I was also taken aback to see the main character smoking and using the word ""pissed."" It's something I've not ever encountered in an Amish book. While I'm no prude, I just wasn't sure of how I felt about it in this genre.

I love seeing something innovative and new in the Amish genre and I feel that Shelley is doing a great job of livening things up a bit. I just wasn't as fond of this particular installment in this series as the others.

I am still interested in reading the last book in this series and I will definitely read more by this author. This particular book just wasn't one of my favorites.

31756,3853,3126,"An enjoyable book about Tom Hazard, a very old man (400 y/o), but you wouldn't know it by looking at him! He looks to be somewhere in his forties. He is stricken with an unusual ""condition"". His condition makes him an ""alba"" which means he could be in danger of being discovered (never aging). Is this a blessing or a curse?

The past and present alternate as we learn how Tom began his journey, and where it will take him over the years. We find out who Tom has loved, the tragedies he has endured, and the lessons we can learn about time.

There is a mystery to unravel, some elements of fantasy as he meets famous people such as Shakespeare and others, a bit of a romantic element, and even a rather thrilling end!

I enjoyed reading this unique book, but felt the alternating chapters of past and present took away from the flow (for me).

 I enjoyed the inviting writing style and how the point if view alternated between human Jack and clone Althea. I found this world to be dystopian without being immediately or overtly dark. Things were slowly revealed that caused dramatic and emotional tension. There was enough that was familiar that it seemed vaguely within the realm of feasibility that this situation could actually occur.

Things began to veer a bit off course for me towards the end of the book. I found things to become a bit rushed and just a bit less enjoyable and easy to follow.

31765,2658,3523,"In 2014, Zhuang Liehong, the son of a fisherman turned tea shop proprietor and spearheader-of-his-village-revolution (with the very cool moniker: The Hot Blooded Youth), was contemplating three routes to US immigration. After growing up in poverty with limited opportunities for education, the enterprising Zhuang met and married his wife, Little Yan, with whom he had a son. (She loved him, according to ""Patriot Number One,"" but was not willing to wait forever if he happened to be jailed for insurgency for a lengthy time.) So he decided to immigrate to America after time spent coordinating protests against local corrupt government of his hometown, Wukan, involving the illegal seizure of the residents' land. Once the couple manage to secure a tourist visa and arrive, they eventually settled in Queens, NY and began the process of settling in and securing US citizenship. In ""Patriot Number One: American Dreams in Chinatown,"" by Lauren Hilgers chronicles this often frustrating but still fascinating journey, also portraying in detail several other immigrants (including Little Yan, whose more levelheaded way of approaching her goals often puts her at odds with her headstrong husband).

In Flushing, Zhuang meets Tang, a longtime revolutionary who serves as a liaison for newly arrived immigrants seeking advice on both practical matters and political activism. While in the US, both men still pursue the latter, and the book describes this, too, including a protest march during the Chinese president's visit to the US to meet President Trump. Also profiled in ""Patriot Number One,"" is Karen (an alias) who Little Yan meets in a community education program. Though her mother imagines an entirely different route for her, Karen (who is university educated when she immigrates and provides a contrast to Little Yan) winds up attending vocational school. As these immigrants face their circumstances with a mixture of optimism and pragmatism, Hilgers moves back and forth in time narrative-wise, additionally describing the uprisings happening in Zhuang's former homeland. The latter in itself might have easily made for a single read-worthy book.

Additionally, Hilgers provides ample background on immigration history in the US, tracing how Chinese immigrants were first welcomed and then restricted under a later ban. Later we see how the characters regard the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath. Overall, ""Patriot Number One"" provides a more even-handed and level-headed alternative to some of the current heated rhetoric when it comes to discussing immigration, as well as an interesting glimpse into lives directly affected by it.",1521936000,4,2014 zhuang liehong son fisherman turn tea shop proprietor spearheaderofhisvillagerevolut cool monik hot blood youth contempl three rout u immigr grow poverti limit opportun educ enterpris zhuang met marri wife littl yan son love accord patriot number one will wait forev happen jail insurg lengthi time decid immigr america time spent coordin protest local corrupt govern hometown wukan involv illeg seizur resid land coupl manag secur tourist visa arriv eventu settl queen ny began process settl secur u citizenship patriot number one american dream chinatown lauren hilger chronicl often frustrat still fascin journey also portray detail sever immigr includ littl yan whose levelhead way approach goal often put odd headstrong husband flush zhuang meet tang longtim revolutionari serv liaison newli arriv immigr seek advic practic matter polit activ u men still pursu latter book describ includ protest march chine presid visit u meet presid trump also profil patriot number one karen alia littl yan meet commun educ program though mother imagin entir differ rout karen univers educ immigr provid contrast littl yan wind attend vocat school immigr face circumst
31766,1773,3901,"The Broken Girls is a well-crafted suspense novel that is set in a small town in rural Vermont.  It has several narrative timelines, which meld very well together as the different strands of the story come together.  The centerpiece of the story is a school for throwaway girls, girls who were trouble, who the relatives didn't want, who were not quite right, who were the children that the maid or mistress had and a shame that was hidden.  In 1950, it was a hidden isolated place, not necessarily a happy place.  And, the girls all believed that it was an old haunted place - that Mary and her bastard child were buried there somewhere.  And, it was a place the girls ran from, disappearing into the woods.

In 2014, the school was decayed, decrepit,abandoned, but still haunted.  And it was a place of rough memories like that of the older sister whose body was found in the field outside the school, strangled, brutalized.  And, twenty years later, questions remain as to whether the right man was found guilty and placed behind bars.  Things aren't all adding up.

Using separate narratives in different timelines is a popular technique these days, but few use it as well as here.  It is a compelling read, hard to put down, with mysteries from many decades ago, historical pasts, and mysterious ghosts who are calling out.",1521936000,5,broken girl wellcraft suspens novel set small town rural vermont sever narr timelin meld well togeth differ strand stori come togeth centerpiec stori school throwaway girl girl troubl rel didnt want quit right child maid mistress shame hidden 1950 hidden isol place necessarili happi place girl believ old haunt place mari bastard child buri somewher place girl ran disappear wood 2014 school decay decrepitabandon still haunt place rough memori like older sister whose bodi found field outsid school strangl brutal twenti year later question remain whether right man found guilti place behind bar thing arent ad use separ narr differ timelin popular techniqu day use well compel read hard put mysteri mani decad ago histor past mysteri ghost call

Amir, the son of a rich man in Kabul, Afghanistan is befriended by Hassan, a boy who is born to a low caste Hazara. Hassan is allowed to play, dine and assist Amir in his daily activities. The innocent loyalty of Hassan towards Amir is very high. But Amir doesnt replicate the same to Hassan and specially, one day when Hassan was attacked by a group of anti-Hazara boys from the neighborhood. This guilt of betrayal makes Amir to distance himself from Hassan and leads to Hassan leaving Amirs home forever.

Hassan is dead and his son is abducted by the Talibans from an orphanage and sexually abused. Amir takes the responsibility of rescuing the boy from the Talibans and adopts him, as a way to reconcile his sin of betraying his father.

The story illustrates how millions of lives are affected by war killings of the innocents and suffering of the survivors and makes one to ponder how some lives end up in tragedy simply by no fault of theirs.

31772,4897,1265,"The Chalk Man was very readable. It was one of those ""just one more chapter"" books. Then you realize about an hour later that you read a lot more than one chapter.

The book goes back and forth between 1986 and 2016. It was very easy to follow the time changes. Some books can be somewhat confusing when this is done.

The 1986 portion is a story of 12 year olds who are friends and live in a small town. There are 4 boys and 1 girl. They have fun doing things that 12 year old like to do. They ride their bikes, meet in the park and set up a secret message system using different colors of chalk. That fun year changed when a horrific accident happens at a fair and a body is discovered in the woods. When I think of a coming of age description , I think ""what a coming of age."" You wouldn't want this to happen to anyone.

In the 2016 portion, 30 years have past. Three of the 5 still live in the same town. The past still affects them. Ed (Eddie) goes back in his mind many times to the year of 1986. Resolutions from the time period just don't ring true to him.

There were quite a few incidents that happened between 1986 and 2016. They seem to be tied to the year of 1986. There were surprises and twists. I did not have it solved until the author divulged it.

It seems hes gotten life back together again, even while haunted by his departure from the Department, when he gets a letter in the mail from the woman involved in setting him up nearly a decade earlier, expressing her apologies and willing to return to New York, testify, and clear his name. At the same time, a man convicted of the murder of two cops is on death row when his attorney, confident he can get the convictions overturned, quits the case. Oliver is the only one left who can help make his case.

Jason is a media sensation, author of popular nonfiction book Equalnomics,"" NYU professor and owner of a consulting company that advises other companies on how to make corporate decisions based on principles of equality. He is the darling of the liberal 1-percenters.

Angela was from the other side of the tracks on Long Island. She worked as a caterer to wealthy Hamptonites, where she met Jason, who swept her off her feet. Jason loves Angela and her young son Spencer, and they made a happy home in Chelsea, with Spencer at a private school and Angela at home caring for both of them.

All is well until the day a young intern accuses Jason of sexual harassment. He quickly becomes persona non grata until a police investigation is completed. His name is splashed all over the media, and the family comes under the spotlight, something that frightens Angela.

There is something in Angelas past that she doesnt want to come to light. She has gone to great lengths to begin a new life with Jason, and this incident could jeopardize that.

A dogged female police detective is determined to get to the bottom of this when the woman who accused Jason of rape suddenly disappears. She believes there is more to the Powell familys story.

31787,104,601,"There are 3 PROS to this book that must not be named because of Amazons childish rules against cussing:

1. TSAoNGaF does an excellent job of making me feel motivated.
2. Ive found that I take more joy in my problems and struggles.
3. Im more attuned to the petty stuff that I care too much about.

The 3 CONS are:

1. The book feels a little disjointed.
2. There is a lot of shade thrown at self-help books.
3. I would have liked more practical steps that an idiot like me could take in his life.

I didn't buy this book. My wife did. And, I didn't really want to read it. She made me. Im big into self-help books. You can see some of my thoughts on others Ive read by visiting my profile. I usually take about one or two bits of wisdom from each one. Its rare that one really transforms me. TSAoNGaF was one of the ones that gave me a couple bits of wisdom. And, Im grateful for that! It was worth my time!

I think this book is best for people who hate self-help books because Manson takes a clear stance against self-help books through misrepresentation. Of course, it could be that hes just read some REALLY crappy self-help books. They are definitely out there. But, I think hes trying to speak to an audience that has no experience with and has a negative preconception of most self-help books. This causes him to come off as arrogant at times. I wonder if he cares? LOL.

Anyway, overall, I enjoyed reading the book. And, I think it will continue to help me enjoy my problems more and pursue tougher challenges. So, thank you, Mark!

I recommend this book to people who either love or hate self-help books. If you're in between, go watch TV or something.

Attached are a couple photos of my favorite passages to prove that I actually read it.

31788,4065,1933,"Well that was a waste of time. This book spends its entire length asking one real question. Will the main character's baby survive? There are a number of smaller questions - Will the baby be born normal? Why is evolution turning backwards, or sideways? What happened to the main character's father? What happened to her friend from the hospital? What happened to her husband? Does she ever find freedom?

THE BOOK ANSWERS NONE OF THESE QUESTIONS.

I am really frustrated with this book. Why did I bother reading it if it refuses to resolve any of its plotlines?

We're going to get a little bit into writing theory here. It has been a classic recommendation to have the climax of your book 2/3 of the way through the book, and have the last third be denouement. Wrap-up. Show us how the climax affected the characters and the world. John Green does this well - all his books follow a standard plot line. Character A is introduced. A meets B. B changes A's life. B leaves A's life. (Those last two are usually incorporated in the climax of the book.) A has to learn how to live without B in a world changed by B's existence in it. It's a little formulaic, but it works for Green, and his books are great. Some books do not do this so well. Wheel of Time had 5-6 pages of denouement after the series climax, and nothing was really revealed about how the events changed the world for the better. Future Home of the Living God had TWO. TWO PAGES AFTER THE CLIMAX. AND THEY ANSWER NOTHING. The main character talks about missing winter.

I finished the book and almost threw it across the room. I probably would have, except for two things: I was at a friend's house, and it was a library book. That's all that saved it from that fate. I have stacks of books I want to read, and I feel like I just wasted a few hours on this piece of crap.

The writing was actually pretty good, and the main character is an Ojibwe Indian, so there's minority representation, but the book as a whole was just CRAP. Wrap up your plotlines. Answer the questions you ask. (At least the ones having to do with your plot - you can leave unanswered philosophical questions, that's fine.)

31789,703,3644,"This story takes you on a journey through different lands and different times.
The Queen's Rising is a good solid tale. It has everything a book like this should. Political intrigue, deeply hidden secrets, an intricate dangerous plan, blood and death, betrayal, love and loss. If it's supposed to be in there it is!
The beginning of the book moves a little slowly but it's so interesting learning about the different passions and getting to see how close all the girls become while studying to be the very best. The thing about it is that it seemed to slow a little but it was taking the time to build up to what was going to happen next. It's a little hard to explain without giving anything away so I'll simply say the first half of the book was good. It introduced you to a lot of characters, many of which aren't in the book past the first half but it showed great friendships and it was like a story in and of itself. You were also given hints of things that would be very important. Then the second half started up and it just went crazy good. So many things happened! The story really picked up and a great many things begin to happen. I don't want to slip and give anything away but after the sweetness of the first part of the book, this second part is much more action/adventure type and maybe there is some blood and gore, just a little maybe. It's still character driven, but it's just so very good. The story comes to life and the plot takes shape. A whole new cast of characters are introduced and most from the first half are no longer in the book. New places are introduced. This just become all sorts of brilliant and the real story is front and center.
I know I'm not giving a lot of information here but as I type this there are very few reviews up and I don't want to spoil anything! I think the book synopsis says all you really need to jump into the story. It would be horrible to spoil the book for you. It's quite good and worth reading and seeing what you think for yourself.

31790,1137,3796,"Taleb has delivered another intriguing book that centers on dealing with uncertainty in life. With his now-familiar straight forward and engaging writing style, he exposes the reader to numerous and varied people and ideas that have shaped history. His main thesis is the importance of not leaving decisions up to bureaucrats, who have no ""skin in the game"". He cites several examples, especially related to the field of finance, where certain individuals are exposed to the upsides of decisions but then pass the downside effects off to others, thereby coming away unscathed and ready to repeat the process over again. Another underlying theme throughout is his belief that most intellectuals do not properly understand the field of probabilities and constantly misapply it and when the inevitable disastrous effects occur, they blame it on something other than their own ignorance.

The book is written in short chapters with his important conclusions separated and printed in italics. This makes for easy reference and makes his key ideas more digestible. Some of the biggest values in the book are his originality and independence of thought- he very proudly asserts his ideas and backs them up with the thinking that he had to have done on his own in order to defend them. He is also reality centered- which is very rare with today's intellectuals. He demonstrates this by showing that if something continually works, it can't be stupid. He shows experience gained by doing is far more valuable than by conclusions drawn only from reasoning. This is in sharp contrast to most other writers of today who when confronted with a conflict between their ideas/ worldview and reality, are quick to dispense with reality. Taleb shows that one of the prime benefits of having skin in the game is it keeps people tied to reality.

Another key idea he shares is related to the Lindy effect and the importance of recognizing the asymmetry of outcomes. The lindy effect states that something that has been around for a while is more likely to stay around (experience over rationalism) and how overlooking asymmetrical outcomes will inevitably end in ruin by underestimating the severity of tail risk.

My two biggest gripes are his attitude that employees are slaves and that virtue consists of sacrificing for the collective. He seems genuinely concerned with the average worker and is definitely not shy about attacking the ""experts"", but also calls pretty much anyone other than an entrepreneur a slave. Perhaps it is because I fall squarely into this category, but the idea that people who work for others are slaves undermines the entire system of capitalism- capitalism is the only system that prevents slavery, in principle. And while I agree wholeheartedly with his attack on big government, it does not make sense to me how much emphasis he places on individuals and entrepreneurs but then also states the importance of sacrificing to the collective.

Highly recommend, along with his previous books. Very thought provoking from an all too rare independent thinker.",1521936000,5,taleb deliv anoth intrigu book center deal uncertainti life nowfamiliar straight forward engag write style expo reader numer vari peopl idea shape histori main thesi import leav decis bureaucrat skin game cite sever exampl especi relat field financ certain individu expo upsid decis pas downsid effect other therebi come away unscath readi repeat process anoth underli theme throughout belief intellectu properli understand field probabl constantli misappli inevit disastr effect occur blame someth ignor book written short chapter import conclus separ print ital make easi refer make key idea digest biggest valu book origin independ thought proudli assert idea back think done order defend also realiti center rare today intellectu demonstr show someth continu work cant stupid show experi gain far valuabl conclus drawn reason sharp contrast writer today confront conflict idea worldview realiti quick dispens realiti taleb show one prime benefit skin game keep peopl tie

31795,2577,3903,"Most certainly would Peter Schweizers recently released Secret Empires keep a Special prosecutor occupied for years to come, the book also serves as a textbook for encouraging term limits. Some of the material presented was known by this reader, yet a majority came as a surprise.

It is no secret that Mitch McConnell has soft positions when it comes to China, but it was surprising how close his wifes shipping family is with the Chinese Communist Party. When Elaine Chao was Secretary of Labor, this reader on two occasions sat across the aisle from her on United Airlines non-stop flight from Beijing to Chicago. It was on the second occasion that I was left wondering why does the Secretary of Labor travel to China so frequently? Now we know.

As one reads through the various chapters, you simply wonder how these people get away with this stuff. If President Trump did half of the deals in office that evidently Penny Pritzker did as Secretary of Commerce under Obama, he would be promptly tarred and feathered by the most trusted name in news. The section of Jared Kushner was interesting, although it seems that at this time the only thing that he can be charged with is not being the smartest businessman.

While Joe Biden hints at running for president in 2020, with this book now on the streets, there is no way that he can. The multiple deals for his son Hunter in China and the Ukraine, while his father was actively involved in both countries hints for a Special Prosecutor. And that goes as well for the step-son of John Kerry, Chris Heinz, who was involved with Hunter Biden in several of these get rich awfully fast schemes. And perhaps more frightening is the expansion of China into the South China Sea, an action that could have been, should have been, stopped by Joe Biden & John Kerry but was not, and this reader wonders why.

And then there is the massive snatch & grab schemes by the friends of Obamas anti-industry regulations. It is deep and you simply need to read the book to grasp what happened while the nation slept.

The basic premise is that a Count in post revolutionary Russia has been sentenced to spend the rest of his days in the hotel where he currently resides, because of a subversive poem that he is alleged to have written.  Since the alternative is being shot, the count accepts his sentence, and while living there comes to know young Nina, who will change his life his ways he could never imagine.

An Amish story with a twist, His Risk is full of suspense and danger. Add in a sweet romance that cant be and you have a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Written realistically, expect that as you read. There is talk of smoking, drugs, and other things that go with the criminal element but Gray wrote all this very tastefully. Without it, the book wouldnt be as genuine and it didn't bother me in the least.

The characters were well developed and genuine. There was much regret about the past that included rejection and loneliness, but we see that nobody is beyond redemption when God is allowed to work in lives.

31801,2376,3468,"Anatomy of a Miracle by Jonathan Miles is a novelized account of a true story. Cameron Harris' life has fallen apart multiple times: his father left when he was young, his mother died when he was a teenager, soon after her death, hurricane Katrina destroyed half of his hometown, he was rejected by a lover, and he became paralyzed while serving in Afghanistan. Now, he and his sister Tanya live in Biloxi, Mississippi. They are poor, but happy. Then Cam suddenly arises from his wheelchair and walks outside of a neighborhood store owned by a Vietnamese couple. As many times as Cam's life has changed in an instant before, it is about to change again.

Cam becomes a sensation over-night. The doctors at the Veterans Administration hospital do test after test to determine why he is now able to walk. Was he misdiagnosed before? Can this apparent cure be duplicated in others? The Catholic church sends an investigator to determine if this is really a miracle. People arrive from all over the world to visit the spot where Cam was cured, hoping to meet him and ask him to pray for their loved ones. And, of course, a Hollywood TV show producer makes contact and begins to film a reality TV show about Cam and Tanya. When his service record comes out, there is no doubt that Cam is a hero and the man of the hour. No one can get enough of him.

But then another fact comes out, and he is rejected again. In another of life's instants, he turns from famous to infamous.

This story both intrigued and infuriated me! It took me much longer to read than usual because Miles gives wonderful in-depth descriptions of what is going on - what the various characters are feeling and why. He is a very talented writer indeed.

I am furious because as far as America has come in many ways, there are some things that still divide the nation. We have grown so much, and yet are still held back by our biases and judgements of others. Enough already!! Get over yourself!

Well worth the read!!

31805,3080,868,"News of the World by Paulette Jilesisone of the best books Ive read in a long while. The setting is 1870s Texas, a turbulent time in that states history. The main character, Captain Jefferson Kidd, is an extraordinarily vital 71-year old man who fought in the War of 1812 and the war with Mexico. In between wars, he marries a woman from a proud Mexican family, has two daughters, and runs a successful printing business. The War between the States destroys his life: his wife dies and his business doesnt survive the conflict as he is called into action yet again. After the war, Captain Kidd travels the small towns of northern Texas and earns a living by reading newspaper articles from exotic locales to town folk at 10 cents a head. When he visits a larger location, he replenishes his supply of newspapers from London and cities back east. It is a subtle art he practices since he must gage the mood of his audience and avoid political conflict at any cost. At one of his readings, a man approaches him and offers him a $50 gold piece if he will return a young German girl to her remaining family. Johannas family members were brutally massacred during a Kiowa raid and she was taken as a prisoner at age four. She has lived as an adopted member of the tribe for six years but her Kiowa family has been pressured into selling her back to the whites for a few blankets and trinkets. Captain Kidd reluctantly agrees to take Johanna south. The two face a harrowing journey through Comanche territory and the ever-shifting political allegiances of small-town Texas. The bond that develops between Johanna and the Captain showcases some of the most heartwarming, gorgeous writing Ive ever experienced. Johanna is a complicated character who doesnt fit in anywhere. She remembers nothing about her first family and is bewildered at the loss of her Kiowa family. It is a triumph that this novel succeeds in capturing the restoration of trust between these two, even though trust is restored in excruciatingly painful increments. And the historical detail is about as perfectly done as one could wish. I treasure this book. It leapt right off the page and permeated my spirit like a balm even though it has tough moments.

31810,4065,3555,"This was EXCELLENT. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is one of my feminist heroes (I have a long list, with biographies I should read!) and this book is great. It's VERY easy to read, and was never less than fascinating. It includes some of her dissents, with commentary for the layperson written by various lawyers. There are photos of her at various points in her life; her face now is so familiar that seeing pictures of her as a young lawyer was really neat.

The only thing I didn't like was that it's not completely linear; there's a chapter about her 56-year-long marriage to Marty Ginsburg, ending with his death, and then the next chapter starts talking about Marty's reaction to something! So that was slightly odd and I had to flip back a few pages to find the actual dates for what I was reading about now.

Other than that, though, the book was really interesting, and talks about the cases she argued before the Supreme Court before becoming a justice, her nomination and senate confirmation to the Court, and the cases she's seen since becoming a justice. It talks about how Ruth and Marty balanced their work and home lives, in a way that was definitely not normal at the time; Marty was a full partner in parenting and housework, taking over all of the cooking and the 2 am infant feedings because it was easier for him to get back to sleep!

Overall, this was a really neat look into the life of one of the U.S.'s most prominent female figures right now. Justice Ginsburg has been a tireless fighter for equality for her entire career, and this book reveals some of her motivations and thought processes.

There were a couple of times in the book after a person disappeared that Loung wrote what she imagined happened to them. It was hard for me to believe that a six-year-old would imagine the things she described, so those passages felt less genuine to me and felt more like she read about details of the Khmer Rouges practices as an adult and wove them into the story for dramatic effect.

31814,4065,1828,"So much to say about this outstanding debut novel! First I'd like to address the issues around the author, then I'll delve into the book itself. (It's fantastic, though!)

So the book has been touted as an ""own voices"" novel, seemingly much to the author's chagrin. She is Muslim, but she's a white convert (Chakraborty is her married name). She has striven to correct the misconception about her ethnicity when she finds it, tweeting about it and talking about it in interviews. (This interview is a good example.) Because the book is pure fantasy, in a fantasy realm after the first few chapters, I'm not too worried about it not actually being written by a middle-eastern author. She does note in the interview I linked that she's not qualified to write some stories because of her ethnicity, and I appreciate that recognition of privilege. As far as I can tell, (as a white person myself) she did justice to the bits of mythology that she included. (Given the reception by people who were so excited about it being an Own Voices book, I think I'm probably right.) Her twitter (@SChakrabs) is FULL of links to minority authors and retweets about their books. I am very impressed by the level of her advocacy for minority authors.

So that aside, I LOVED THIS BOOK. I almost always enjoy fantasy inspired by non-western mythology:Children of Blood and Bone was fantastic, and though Forest of a Thousand Lanterns had a western fairytale at its heart, being reimagined through an Asian lense was really neat to read. The Bear and The Nightingale and The Girl in the Tower were Russian inspired, as were The Crown's Game/The Crown's Fate. I really do try to pick up non-western inspired fantasy when I can. City of Brass scratched that itch perfectly.

City of Brass opens in Cairo, where our heroine, Nahri, is a con-woman with small healing magics. When a ritual goes awry, she's thrust into the world of the djinn. It's when Nahri and her accidental bodyguard, Dara, arrive at the Djinns' city of Daevabad that the story really gets started.

I'm still a little confused about the difference between djinn and Daeva; Daeva seem to be one of the tribes but also the name for the entire race, and some of them get offended at being called djinn but some of them don't? I'm not really sure about that distinction. There is a clear line between djinn and Ifrit, though - Ifrit are immensely powerful, immortal beings who refused to subject themselves to punishment many centuries ago. I'm not sure I actually see a downside to being Ifrit, other than the djinn all think they're evil. The Ifrit, however, are out to get Nahri, and Dara's not having any of THAT.

I love Dara - he's a fascinating character, with a violent, mysterious backstory. I'm very eager to read more about him and figure out exactly what's up with his background. Nahri is also awesome - a little arrogant, but by the end of the book she's starting to learn she might need help from those around her. Unfortunately, also by the end of the book she doesn't know who to trust. The naive djinn prince, Ali, is the third main character of the book, and while I can see him having an interesting story, his personality is still a little flat. Hopefully the second book will see advancement in all three of these characters' personalities.

And I can't WAIT for the second book! City of Brass didn't exactly end on a cliffhanger, but it did leave many questions unanswered and our main characters' fates uncertain. Unfortunately, I can't find any information on the sequel, just that it's being edited. No release date or title yet.

31815,2887,1699,"I read this for my RL book club, and I'll admit I was not interested in doing so. (I always get outvoted in every single book club I join.)

So I was very pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be pretty excellent and yet another ""western"" that I can say I actually liked. I've been dithering about stars, so as usual take stars with a grain of salt. It's a great book. I'm pretty sure it will be on lists of the best of 2018.

It's a bloody awful mess quite literally, but it's effective and affecting. It's easy sometimes to forget that racism happens everywhere and that other countries have horrific and bloody histories when it comes to indigenous peoples or people different from the dominant.

Tommy and Billy McBride have lived a relatively innocent life with their parents, sister and father's ranch workers, despite the reality of a drought which is killing their cattle. Their parents have raised them well and protected them from the worst of human nature. When the boys are in their mid-teens (fourteen and sixteen, respectively) they arrive home from an afternoon of swimming to find a fateful and senseless tragedy.

The boys, on their own now, turn to their most wealthy neighbor, John Sullivan who calls in Inspector Noone and his band of Native Queensland police. We watch as the two of them pervert the boys suffering into vengeance, push them (and the native police) to take part in a genocide of the Kurrong tribe, and eventually cause a rift between the brothers that will last forever.

It's gut wrenching to watch the two young boys taken from relative safety and innocence to bloodlust and mental turbulence. It's terrifying to see how misplaced trust or anger can alter morality and belief. While this is set in the late 1800s of Australia, the lessons it paints carry great meaning everywhere still.",1521936000,5,read rl book club ill admit interest alway get outvot everi singl book club join pleasantli surpris turn pretti excel yet anoth western say actual like ive dither star usual take star grain salt great book im pretti sure list best 2018 bloodi aw mess quit liter effect affect easi sometim forget racism happen everywher countri horrif bloodi histori come indigen peopl peopl differ domin tommi billi mcbride live rel innoc life parent sister father ranch worker despit realiti drought kill cattl parent rais well protect worst human natur boy midteen fourteen sixteen respect arriv home afternoon swim find fate senseless tragedi boy turn wealthi neighbor john sullivan call inspector noon band nativ queensland polic watch two pervert boy suffer vengeanc push nativ polic take part genocid kurrong tribe eventu caus rift brother last forev gut wrench watch two young boy taken rel safeti innoc bloodlust mental turbul terrifi see misplac trust anger alter moral belief
31816,2887,198,"I think I would like to be friends with Gabrielle Union, though I doubt she has the time. I'll be honest, as not too much of a social media or celebrity person, I wasn't entirely sure who she even was, but then I realized I'd seen her speeches on YouTube, and I had always liked what she had to say. So clearly I was in.

Gabrielle Union is a smart lady. She's clear on things like being a stepmom, rape, being black in the USA, being a woman, trying to get pregnant, not having children of her own...

When Union is passionate, she writes extremely well. When she is dwelling on gossip, it lost the luster for me. I honestly don't care much about how hard it is to be in the public spotlight or how Hollywood doesn't treat older women well. Know what? The whole world doesn't treat older women well. Somehow I can't feel sorry for these celebs.

But when she writes from the heart: about the difficulty in coming to terms with aging or the trauma of assault and rape or any number of other topics, she soars.

And, because I often put it aside for long periods of time, it was hard for me to keep up with all the time jumping. I had trouble indexing the situations within the overall timeframe sometimes. But, I tried to not stress about it (since everything else in my life was stressful). The author didn't give the reader time to really get to know the characters, other than the main character. And the overall situation was a bit uncertainthe plot seemed fuzzy at times. But, I guess, the main point was that Tom was trying to find his daughter.

31832,301,626,"Amy Bloom's White Houses is a fictionalized account of the FDR White House years. The story begins in 1945 just after FDR's death and moves back and forth in time.  We learn of FDR's affair with his secretary, Missy but surprisingly, very little about his relationship with his own wife, Eleanor. Instead focusing more on the, previously reported, romantic relationship between Eleanor Roosevelt and Associated Press journalist, Lorena Hickok (Hick), when the two women met in 1932 while Hick was covering White House news.

The story is told by Hick and the reader learns much about her poor childhood in South Dakota, and her dysfunctional childhood and her abusive father, We also get insight into her White House days as one of the first female journalists to have such a high profile job. Details are shared about her friendship and genuine love for Eleanor.

I found the book to be a quick read, the writing often humorous, but at times it also fell a bit trashy, which was disappointing as I loved, the in depth NF story Eleanor and Hick by Susan Quinn.

But, here we are with a new crime, suicide vs murder, and Havers is off with her Guv. DCS Ardery to settle the case. However, as time moves on, not much changes, as well as new clues pop up.

DS Havers for as long as she has worked with Lynley has learned a lot, but her social graces and her potty mouth are as irritating as ever. She and DI Lynley finally get to work together, and as a team they work well. This is a long book, with many characters, and it is not until the last third of the book do the characters jell, and we can see what the first two thirds was all about. This is a fascinating story, convoluted at times, but one I thoroughly enjoyed. I found I needed to read this book at intervals, as it would drag. But once I got back into it, I found it more appealing, and the characters flowed with more speed.

31837,4285,1008,"I think we all know what this book is about by now but Ill give a brief summary. This book follows a futuristic world (2045 to be exact) where our MC, Wade, lives most of his life in a video game called Oasis. When one of the creators of Oasis dies, he leaves half a trillion dollars and complete ruling over Oasis for the player who finds his Easter egg.
Ive always been scared of this book since the moment I started seeing it pop up on Instagram. SciFi is a genre waaaaay out of my comfort zone and to make matters worse, I am not a gamer by any means. The games I play are Sims, Choices, and some of Alice Madness Returns. Nothing close to what is written in this novel but even then, something inside of me really really wanted to give this book a chance. That was amplified 10000 % when I saw the first trailer for the movie. Identifying a lot of pop culture references that helped shape my childhood made me too excited for words. So when I had the opportunity to request this title for review, I immediately jumped on it.
Almost as soon as I started reading this, I started to second guess all of my actions. I was massively overwhelmed by all of the information Ernest was feeding me in the first few chapters and I was afraid to even blink in the chance that I would miss a excruciating detail. Of course, this was silly to even think about since I was listening to the audiobook. But no matter, I almost beat myself up for stepping out of my comfort zone.
By the time I was about to give up and step back inside my usual genres, RP1 started picking up. AND BOY DID IT PICK UP.
This is one of the novels that I will never ever stop thinking about, especially since the sequel is now one of my most anticipated novels ever.
This might also be the first time Im admitting this, but I didn't care for the dialogue at all. I was more impressed by the narration and that is just unknown to me. I sometimes (almost always) skip some of the narration in novels to move on to the next line of dialogue since thats what intrigues me the most. The dialogue in this novel felt a tad too juvenile for my taste and it just rubbed me the wrong way. Luckily, I quickly stopped paying attention to it because I was way too busy gobbling up all that Oasis had to offer and everything Wade was doing. Speaking of Wade, I am forever amazed by everything he managed to accomplish. He is such a GENIUS. a part of me felt unworthy of reading about his epic adventures.
Another thing that shocked me was the fact that I didn't mind the romance taking backseat in the plot line. I am the person looking for the next romantic scene instead of paying attention to the rest of the plot but that wasn't the case here and it was just another reason why I am eternally glad I gave this book a chance. I cant even remember the last time a book made me this giddy and excited to learn a new type of world I don't normally get to visit. My usual emotions when it comes to reading were magnified to no end and I looked like a lunatic trying to hold all of my reactions inside. I was completely invested and I couldn't focus on the real world anymore even if I tried.
At first, I wasn't attached to the characters whatsoever. They were just names on a scoreboard for me but boy did that change. In the end, I wanted to recruit all of these characters into my group of friends and help them in any way I could. I cried, laughed, and cheered with them. They almost shocked me unconscious a few times with all the things they were accomplishing and it was a lot of fun. I didn't favor one over the other and it made me treasure the story even more.
I cant even believe this book is behind me after being completely immersed inside of it for 12 days straight. I will always treasure this novel and I cant wait to see what the sequel has to offer!

31839,2640,749,"My review and rating - as for all my reports - reflects how I react to the book and should not be seen some sort of objective score. I did not love this book but it won the Pulitzer Prize in 2011 - so obviously the experts see it differently from me.

When I first picked out a couple of Jennifer Egan's novels to read I decided to start with Manhattan Beach because the structure of this one sounded daunting - if flashes back and forth from past to present to future focusing on different characters of a loosely bound group. Additionally the point of view switches between first, second, and third person. So, you have to be on your mental toes while reading - I wasn't.

The two main characters are Bernie - a music producer and Sasha - his one time assistant. The books starts with Sasha then jumps to other people who know her or Bernie. It is like a set of short stories rather than a novel - except the chapters all revolve around the two main characters and couldn't stand on their own. In other words - exactly like a book of short stories except they aren't.

When one of the characters - who earlier tried to commit suicide - is high he points to the central point of the book:

""...and the question is, which one is really 'you', the one saying and doing whatever it is, or the one watching?"" [Loc 2718]

As we work our way through the story, that is our job: which version of this person is the ""real"" version. But of course we change through our lives and we are the accumulation of all our history.

We read a couple of direct references to the goon squad; I'll leave it to you to read so I won't spoil it here.

This book really never grabbed me; as a result I'd put it aside for a few days and when I picked it up again the next chapter was in a different time with different characters and a different point of view. As a result I had to keep going back to remind myself who is/was who. My advice is dive in and swim through it quickly. That way it will likely hang together more may resonate better. The stories and characters themselves are interesting and the writing saves this from being a two star book - for me.

Alice proserpine has a crazy life always on the go, her and her mother Ella move around more than I do on a normal day. Bad luck just seems to follow them and fairy tales are a no talk about subject along with the infamous grandmother who got famous quickly with writing dark fairytales.

31843,1570,1008,"Rife with more nerd references than I ever thought possible, Ready Player One tells a story both terrifying and creative. An energy crisis leaves most of the world living in dire poverty with the only escape a virtual world synonymous with the Internet, called the Oasis. A world where you can be and do anything you want, where you can live your favorite books or movies, and look anyway you want. In this world, creator James Halliday left a puzzle - and the prize is control of the Oasis. Wade Watts has spent years learning about Halliday and his obsession with the 80s - enough that he finds the first clue. Finding the clue sets in motion deadly events as powerful people seek the prize as well.
Clines creates a likeable character in Watts, someone we could all be. It is his journey, as a person, that gives the story its depth. As the external adventure takes him through dangers, we see how he grows as a person. He finds courage, love, and the life that truly matters. Along with all the other aspects of this fun story, it is this part that made it for me.
With complex characters, fast-paced action, edge-of-seat mysteries, and fantastic world-building, Ready Player One is one giant nerd-gasm.

31844,2032,2279,"The Road is by Cormac McCarthy.  It is a very interesting and dark book.  It deals with the relationship between a father and son who are simply trying to survive in a very hostile and new environment.
Something has happened in the United States which destroyed life as we know it.  Many people were instantly killed and many were murdered in the aftermath.  Every living thing was destroyed.  All animals died, all fish died, most of the people died, there were no crops left, and fire had destroyed almost everything.  The few people who were not killed had to fight for their survival.  The only food sources were the stores and homes which were not destroyed.  People were divided into two groups- good and bad.  The good constantly were on the lookout for the bad.  They stayed by themselves as well as they could.  Strangers were all suspect.  The bad were really bad.  They would steal any and everything they could.  They would take prisoners of anyone they didn't kill.  Rape was rampant and cannibalism began to occur.  There was no law enforcement left to help.
A man and his son were on the road south.  They lived somewhere in the north west United States and decided they must go south out of the extreme cold in order to survive.  The boys mother had left them presumably to die although that wasn't clear.  The man had a shopping cart which he filled with supplies they scrounged as they traveled.  For protection, he had only two bullets left in his pistol.  As they passed towns and houses, they stopped to see if there was anything left in them that they could use.  Most of the time, there was nothing.  As his son begins to starve, the man cant seem to accept it.  How can his son die without him dying too?
Will the two survive their trip south?  If they get there, will there be anything left for them?  Did they have a future or was this all there was?
This book is very dark and very emotional.  As the two travel down the road, you begin to feel for both of them.  The boy is scared, cold, and hungry and afraid to have his father out of his sight.  The father is cold and hungry and also has regrets about his wife.  He doubts his ability to care for his son and he had developed a cough which won't go away.  He doubts his own decisions.  The reader is placed in a situation where he begins to think about what he would do in that situation.  It is definitely a book to make you feel and think.",1521936000,4,road cormac mccarthi interest dark book deal relationship father son simpli tri surviv hostil new environ someth happen unit state destroy life know mani peopl instantli kill mani murder aftermath everi live thing destroy anim die fish die peopl die crop left fire destroy almost everyth peopl kill fight surviv food sourc store home destroy peopl divid two group good bad good constantli lookout bad stay well could stranger suspect bad realli bad would steal everyth could would take prison anyon didnt kill rape rampant cannib began occur law enforc left help man son road south live somewher north west unit state decid must go south extrem cold order surviv boy mother left presum die although wasnt clear man shop cart fill suppli scroung travel protect two bullet left pistol pas town hous stop see anyth left could use time noth son begin starv man cant seem accept

31851,2113,39,"Im so glad I came upon the Southern Reach Trilogy by Jeff VanderMeer. Annihilation (FSG, 2014) is exactly the book I needed on this lazy, cold spring weekend. I read the whole thing in a day, and immediately purchased book #2 on my Kindle the instant I was finished. I plan to devour this series.

If I have one word to describe Annihilation, it is ineffable. Perhaps I don't read a lot of sci-fi horror, but Ive never read anything like this book. It captures the deep and dreadful mystery of what it means to be alive. It plays with your mind. The reader cant be sure whether to trust the narrator, and the indescribable mystery of what the hell is going on in Area X keeps the pages turning and turning.

Our narrator is a nameless biologist who volunteers for a government mission to explore an otherworldly, uncharted wilderness, simply called Area X. Rational thought begins to leave her as she examines the strange new organisms in the land that cant be defined or classified under any science she knows. As we follow her harrowing story of survival through Area X, her own developing madness and the madness and manipulation of her comrades, more of her melancholy backstory and the horrific expeditions that came before hers float to the forefront.

I won't spoil anything other than to warn that all the answers aren't clear by the end of book #1. I kept reading on in hopes for all the puzzle pieces to finally fit together in my brain, but we don't get anything solid apart from theories. Which, in a way, is a poignant metaphor for life. Luckily, there are two more books in the series that will hopefully unravel the mystery of Area X.

Overall, this is a skillfully written, fast-paced yet introspective, almost philosophical adventure/horror of sorts. I would highly recommend this dystopia to readers interested in preternatural science fiction, survival stories, and even monster stories  and to adult fans of The Hunger Games.",1521936000,5,im glad came upon southern reach trilog jeff vanderm annihil fsg 2014 exactli book need lazi cold spring weekend read whole thing day immedi purchas book 2 kindl instant finish plan devour seri one word describ annihil ineff perhap dont read lot scifi horror ive never read anyth like book captur deep dread mysteri mean aliv play mind reader cant sure whether trust narrat indescrib mysteri hell go area x keep page turn turn narrat nameless biologist volunt govern mission explor otherworldli unchart wilder simpli call area x ration thought begin leav examin strang new organ land cant defin classifi scienc know follow harrow stori surviv area x develop mad mad manipul comrad melancholi backstori horrif expedit came float forefront wont spoil anyth warn answer arent clear end book 1 kept read hope puzzl piec final fit togeth brain dont get anyth solid apart theori way poignant metaphor life luckili two book seri hope unravel mysteri area x overal

31856,3766,189,"What a wonderful, great, but horrific and sad story. I read this mostly in one sitting because I could not put it down. The story moved quickly, even though it flipped back and forth from past to present. The characters were well-developed, and I liked how the author did not spend too much time on the present day. Although the senator and his family were certainly relevant to the story, the focus was really around Judy and May and their backgrounds. It was so sweet and genuine, I did not want the book to be over. I really just wanted to spend more time listening to the two of them go on and on.

I really liked Avery and how she ended up, and how she did not care what anyone thought, that there may be some bumps but life would go on. Even though you could call her outcome from a mile away, it was still very enjoyable to read. I don't really have anything negative to say about this book other than the fact that these despicable events occurred so that the author had this subject to write about. That being said, I am very glad she did, and as she says in her note, she reminds us that the lesson to take away is that babies and children  are human beings with histories, and needs, and hopes, and dreams of their own.

There is never any character growth...it's just the same formulaic stories over and over and over again--Stephanie panting between 2, or 3, guys (speaking of Diesel, I still can't figure out why he was in this story--he did nothing); Lula wearing outrageous clothes and eating like a fiend; Grandma Mazur creating havoc at the funeral homes and trying to find herself a man; Big Blue; Ranger's apparent endless supply of luxury vehicles for Stephanie to blow up; Morelli's 24/7 work schedule and apparent sex addiction; Stephanie's mom's drinking problem--seriously, can we just have some GROWTH here? These characters are stunted.

31858,1266,3904,"Sahara and Brand. We've been watching the sparks and looks throughout the stories of the other fighters/BA body guards. He's been fighting it. She's been demanding it. He won't become a BA bodyguard. He won't work for her. He wants her and she most definitely wants him, make no bones about it.

The sexual tension runs high throughout this book. At the same time, the strain of knowing she's in danger ratchets things up. She's literally throwing herself at him and he's rejecting her. Of course, he's being gallant because she's been through so much and she's seeing it only as rejection; of the job and her.

The danger factor is ever present in Fast Burn and it makes the story even better. Scott, her missing brother, may be at the heart of everything. What is his role?  And the attempts to get Sahara keep coming. She is a fiesty and resourceful lady. She's also pretty set in her ways and not sure how her personality fits with Brand's alpha man dominance. When the two finally give in to their basic, primal needs, it's ! But it's also more. It's need, it's sensual, its protective, it's love.

Brand and Sahara have been circling each other throughout the series and I was happy to dive into their story  finally! Fast burn, slow burn - it was finally their time and it was as explosive as Id hoped

Body Armor had no shortage of alpha males. Beautiful, rugged, and deadly capable, they were exactly the talented bodyguards  and eye candy - Sahara had needed to rebrand her brothers security firm. Her brother was dead, a truth she refused to believe. She and her new crew were going to find out the truth, one way or another, and the time was now Brand was a fighter and not interested in Saharas offer of employment. Now if she had a different offer, which included her, that would be different

Even superheroes need rest every now and then.

Sahara was an integral part of the series but this story saw her take center stage. Her personality shined and glowed as she took charge in every situation while never losing her empathy and warmth. She defined the word kick-butt as she held her own in even the direst of situations, using her intelligence to keep her cool, never losing her sense of humour. I loved her character and how Brand recognized how special she was

Yes, and if you're wondering what the lure is for me, its your attitude, your brass, your brains, your sexy body, your beautiful face, your confidence, your--

Together with the characters I knew and loved already, this was a perfect sign off to a great series!

31865,2597,266,"I have to be honest, I really didn't enjoy The Chosen or The Beast, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did. But J.R. Ward just has this way of immersing readers into her Black Dagger Brotherhood world so seamlessly. I couldn't help but get sucked in once again.

In this spinoff book, Axe, a new BDB recruit, and Elise, a vampire grad student, get together to have their steamy, angsty romance that Ward is very much known for. However, I do have to say that the story focused a lot on Rhage, Mary, and (spoilers if you haven't read The Beast), their adopted daughter Bitty. While I found myself going back and forth between which storyline I preferred most throughout the storyAxe and Elises vs. Rhage and MarysI did think there wasn't enough going on in Axe and Elises plot arc. Their POVs most definitely could not add up to an entire book. Maybe a short novella, but not a book.

Thats my main problem with this sequel: what was left unexplored between Axe and Elise. For the Rhage and Mary bits, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked their scenes. Like I mentioned, The Beast just wasn't my thing, even though I loved Lover Eternal, but this one was less about Rhage being whiny. (He was very whiny in The Beast.) Instead, the vampire family actually had a problem going on that I was engrossed in. It was a nice change of pace.

Basically, for this one, Id say don't go into it if you're looking for a simple hot, steamy romance book. Know that its truly just a continuation of the BDB series that focuses on Rhage and Mary. The scenes between Axe and Elise are fine, but there could have been more development on both their parts.

All in all, I think every Black Dagger Brotherhood reader will enjoy this one, even if they didn't necessarily enjoy some of Wards past books in the series. New readers, though, make sure to start with Dark Lover, get sucked in, and never leave the world J.R. Ward has created.

4/5 stars

31874,4004,1328,"Virgil Flowers is back and as usual, he only gets the hard stuff. As if the hunt for a pair of rare tigers stolen from the zoo isn't enough, things are further complicated by murder. And then there's Virgil's personal life and his relationship with Frankie, who is not at all what you'd expect in a cop's girlfriend and neither is her family. One of my favorite things about Virgil is the way he goes about solving a case. It's not so much procedural as a series of conversations where he gets a feel for the people involved and some lucky breaks in unlikely places. The Virgil Flowers series ties in with Sandford's Prey series and many of the characters appear in both, including Jenkins and Shrake, two of my favorites. We also get a couple of peeks at Lucas, who pulled me in and got me started on this crazy journey all the way back in the first Prey novel. Any of the books can be read as standalones, but to get the full story of these characters, I would recommend reading the series in order. John Sandford has created some of the most colorful characters in crime fiction and thrown them into some wonderfully adventurous tales full of suspense, action, and even a bit of humor as they interact while solving their cases. As I did listen to this one, I should add that as a long time fan of the author who hasn't missed a book, I was quite impressed with Eric Conger's narration. He brings Virgil to life perfectly and kept me listening long past bedtime to hear what would happen next.",1521936000,5,virgil flower back usual get hard stuff hunt pair rare tiger stolen zoo isnt enough thing complic murder there virgil person life relationship franki youd expect cop girlfriend neither famili one favorit thing virgil way goe solv case much procedur seri convers get feel peopl involv lucki break unlik place virgil flower seri tie sandford prey seri mani charact appear includ jenkin shrake two favorit also get coupl peek luca pull got start crazi journey way back first prey novel book read standalon get full stori charact would recommend read seri order john sandford creat color charact crime fiction thrown wonder adventur tale full suspens action even bit humor interact solv case listen one add long time fan author hasnt miss book quit impress eric conger narrat bring virgil life perfectli kept listen long past bedtim hear would happen next

31881,2282,2276,"A Torch Against the Night exceeded my acceptation. I am always nervous when it comes to second book because lets face it sometimes its hard to follow-up a popular debut book. Sabaa Tahir battled against all of those second book stereotypes and came out as victories as a Mask.  This book will forever have my tear stains imprinted into the pages.  Okay now I am going to try to put on my mask face and get my emotions under control so I can do this review.

A Torch Against the Night picks up where we were left hanging in An Ember of Ashes. After saving Elias from death Laia and Elias are running for their life in a dangerous quest to save her brother from the most famous prison Kauf. The mission and journey there as all things never goes as planned.

Dont look so worried. Most successful missions are just a series of barely averted disasters.  Elias

The plot of this book finally gave us some answers to the questions that have plague us all since book 1. One question in particular that is touch upon is about the Nightbringer. We finally got to learn a little about the history about the King of the Jinn and what he really wants. There is still so many question I have running through my head but at least we got some answers.

Laia has become a force to reckon with in this book. Dear god her character is the definition of character development. The fact that it was a slow growth and that I see how each event in the story changes made me connect with her more than I did in book 1.

She faces so many challenges that test everything that she is and its beginning to mold her into the person she was always meant to be. She takes a lot of hits in this book and has to make some tough calls that aren't always the right call. She must find a way to deal with the consequences of her choices.

Your emotions make you human, Elias says. Even the unpleasant ones have a purpose. Dont lock them away. If you ignore them, they just get louder and angrier.

What I love most about Laia is that when she makes a bad mistake she learns from it then lifts her chin and tries again.

It takes only a split second for life to go horribly wrong. To fix the mess, I need a thousand things to go right. The distance from one bit of luck to the next feels as great as the distance across oceans. But, I decide in this moment, I will bridge that distance, again and again, until I win. I will not fail.

Elias was everything I need in this book! Apparently freedom from Blackcliff has done wonders for his personality. I never realized he had such a dry sense of humor and I loved every moment of it.

I should just build a bleeding house here, I mutter as I pick myself up off the snow-covered ground. Maybe get a few chickens. Plant a garden.  Elias

Elias is at a consent battle with the memories of the horrible things that Blackcliff has done to him and made him do in the name of the Empire. During the journey he is struggling not only to find out who is without the mask but trying to make amends for all the blood that has stained his hand after the trails in book 1.

Dont you see? As long as you fight the darkness, you stand in the light.  -to Elias

The relationship and partnership between Laia and Elias was wonderful. They are the complete opposite but they seem to make each other better people. They each bring out the best qualities of each other. Plus, I will go down with this beautiful ship!

You are my temple, I murmur as I kneel beside her. You are my priest. You are my prayer. You are my release.  Elias

Helena was a character that got on my nerves a little in book one but I have to say in this book I fell in love with her. I dare say I enjoyed her point of view more than I did the Elias and Laias. Helena is the Blood Shrike to the new slightly completely crazy Emperor Marcus. She is struggling with her loyalty to the Empire and her friend who is now a traitor.

Veturius is a Mask like the rest of us, yes. Bold, brave, strong, swift. But those were afterthoughts for him. Elias sees people as they should be, not as they are. He laughs at himself. He gives of himself  in everything he does. [] Hes the things that I cant be. Hes good. -Helena

Helena has some major growth in this book and is face with some hard choices. Helena realizes that sometimes the easy choice isn't always the right choice, and some times it takes more than blood and sweat to save an Empire from crumbling.

But you, Helene Aquilla, are no swift-burning spark. You are a torch against the night  if you dare to let yourself burn.

Overall this book was a wonderful, thrilling, and breath-taking addition to the brilliance of An Ember of the Ashes. I am so excited to read A Reaper at the Gates that comes out in June and see where this story will lead to next.

31883,770,3499,"The Sandman (SM) by Lars Kepler, actually a husband and wife writing team, is the 4th of six Joona Linna novels.  Joona is with National (Swedish) Crime and much of the action takes place in the Stockholm area.  I was recently drawn to this book by a NYT Janet Maslin review.  In her review she mentions that the series never quite caught on as hoped for in the US back in 2014, and she theorizes it was due to all the competition from better known Scandi authors, Nesbo, Stieg Larsson et al.  Im not so sure that I agree with that.  I recall the introduction of the first Joona book, The Hypnotist (HY) and the publicity surrounding its release.  My recollection was that reviews were mixed and that many critics focused negatively on the gore and torture in the story; I decided to pass.  Upon the recent reissue of SM, I read another somewhat favorable review in the Washington Post and decided to give the series a try. Bad decision.

The story starts off well enough.  A psycho killer, Jurek, is held in isolation in a suite of cells behind quadruple levels of security, ala Hannibal Lecter.  One cant escape several parallels between the two (I am tempted to cite the delicious quote of Senator Lloyd Bentsen but Ill resist).  It is assumed he knows the location of a young girl held in captivity and she is in danger of dying within days.  How to get the information?  Thats the set-up, and one big problem with the plot is that most of us can do a rough outline of the rest of the story.  Dont believe me?  OK, major plot point number two..cmon, think about it.thats right, plant a cop in one of the adjoining suite cells, a female cop right? A gorgeous female cop!

Yes, it gets a bit predictable, and gory.  And we learn an awful lot about drugs used to treat psychos (and some of us).  And some plot points really strain credibility.  To the breaking point.  As when Jurek whispers to cellmate #3 (a real bad guy brought in with gorgeous cop just to trick Jurek into believing gorgeous cops cover story) an order to take a nearby electric cord, sling it over the door, and hang himself.  And guess what #3 does?  Maybe these authors are a bit too much into hypnotism.  So what is hero Joona doing all this time?  He is the guy who captured Jurek long ago.  He knows Jurek.  He can anticipate what Jurek is going to do.  So when all the other cops come to a consensus on what their next step should be, Joona jumps in and tells them they are all wrong and they have to do the exact opposite.  Joona is a bore and I don't really care what has happened to Joona.  Its not a good thing when you don't care for your hero.

SM felt to me like a one-set play for most of the story, lots of dialog, monitoring of conversations etc.  Then the tail end becomes an action thriller.  I can almost see the movie trailers now.

Note that I mentioned re-issue in the opening paragraph.  The first book, HY, has been re-translated, and is in the process of being reissued; the original version does not seem the be available.  However, other books in the series are available on Amazon, some in paper, some on Kindle.  I mention all this just in case some of you may be drawn to the series and may read other entries.

31884,2678,3914,"The Fear produced extreme fear, and a strange kind of icckiness in me, I was scared to read, yet I was fascinated with the story. I have always enjoyed C. L. Taylor's novels, but this by far, was the most different amongst them, dealing with a difficult topic. Kudos to her

Taylor's characters, her story, and her character development, their complexities have a strange eerie quality to them. You know something is going to happen but you just don't know when. The story is narrated in multiple points of view, the ladies who form the main characters.

Lou the main character, who at the age of 14, ran away with her teacher Mike, who had 'groomed' her in the weeks prior. The story starts by following Lou's present life with excerpts into the past. She is still haunted by the so called 'love' of her childhood, the horror of it all. Mike made my skin crawl from the beginning to the end as he preys on young girls. (he is 49 years old now, just eeuu)

To take charge of her life, she decides to confront Mike, but she sees him kissing another 14 year old child Chloe. The story follows her life too along with her feelings for Mike.

Then there is Wendy, an unknown character, who is almost stalking Lou. What, in the wide world, is happening in this book??

I am going to write my review as I finish parts of the book

At 25% of book completion, Lou has met Chloe, warned her, her family, and the police. Wendy has met Lou under false pretenses, and is almost savage in her action. Lou has met Mike, and something drastic happens.... The atmosphere of the book is so intense that I am forced to put it down, take a deep breath, write this review, and then continue reading. At this point, I don't know where the book is going, and I don't care. I just want to follow the characters to the end.

At nearly 50% : Amidst the strange happenings and unforeseeable circumstances, Lou now knows who Wendy is and how she is connected to the plot. Omg I had goosebumps!! It looks like I am too involved in this book. Moving on....

At 100%, I am just amazed at this story, this story is just insane. I read the book with my heart in my mouth. My breath hitched, my heart raced, my palms sweated. I had to literally calm myself down after reading the book to slow down the adrenaline flow to complete this review.

The Fear by C. L. Taylor, deals with a difficult subject about a predator, but the story was paced fabulously with the right amount of tension filled scenes to make it the book of the day. Sighhhh... What a book!!!

31901,1827,3852,"This book was fantastical and perfect. All of KMMs best traits in here in beautiful, seamless blend: galactic origins, visceral despair and triumph, perfect misunderstandings, passionate introspection in flawless inner monologues, wicked humor, plain as day man meets woman vibes and tension...the list don't stop but Ill leave it there. Lots of the questions I had scribed above were revisited. The story itself didn't have that delusive air (like the spatial distortion of BB&B) that I love about the Fever series. The feeling where the story is so big, it stretches in every direction and its a pain and a joy to narrow your focus.. kinda like how u feel disoriented but fascinated at 4 floors becoming 6. You get me???

But the book was very stand-alone friendly. And I commend and resent that lol. Im pleased beyond measure regardless but I cant help but hate tidy endings even tho both Ryodan and Dani were starved for one and more than deserving! I surely wouldnt have suffered another book of denial, be it carnal or chaste; that man was meant to be with that woman, dammit! But I kinda expected a more obscured love.

Lets just say, Mac and Barrons relationship is NOT the same as RyoDani. Hella similarities but gosh no they are more effusive and less severe. And I guess Im a glutton for punishment-I love the stranglehold that seized the former couple but knew I couldn't suffer that same restraint twice! Like Dani, i think Fever readers were bursting at the seams for more of the relatable relationship. The elaborate world building didn't cease in this book either but again it was less severe. No ultra terrifying Sinsar dubh ( who is one of my favorite villains OAT) no Hag killing friends perpetually, no Hoar Frost king, no Cruce. ( for nowwwwww..your girl wants him back like yesterday) and less continuous battle for self-identity. Less is loosely used cause Dani did go thru her very personal demons just not an evil book.

We see a story of a youngish couple who suddenly realizes how long they might be together and wondering how they can stay together that terribly long....so they decide to surprise each other to keep the spark alive.

The story does take a turn and Sylvia, our main character, suddenly begins to worry and ultimately, has to grow up. She has to take off her rose-colored glasses when it comes to her father and see the man for who, he really was. In the process, she sees her husband and mother for who they are and matures in a new way completely.

This is a story with a big cast and maybe because I have read a book in a middle of a series I got a bit confused. Keeping track of them all was not that easy. Basically two families but with many, many people on the side, all very individualistic, all having issues and problems of their own converging into one community.

31913,518,3837,"""A Brush with Shadows"" is a mystery set in 1831 in England. It is the sixth book in the series. You do not need to read the previous books to understand this one, and this book did not spoil the mysteries of the previous novels.

The historical and setting details that were woven into the story make it feel distinct to that time and place. The main characters acted realistically and were interesting people. The heroine lacked common sense and often rushed into danger, but she was observant in regard to possible clues. Her husband was a little dense when it came to suspecting people in his family home, which slowed his progress in solving the mystery. He dealt with emotional wounds from his childhood as well as the current mystery.

The couple asked questions and followed leads while avoiding danger, as someone was not happy that they were there. I initially thought the clues were pointing towards one person, but that changed near the end. At that point, only one person seemed to fit the clues who hadn't been ""cleared,"" and, indeed, that was whodunit. So guessing whodunit is possible.

There were no sex scenes. There was a minor amount of bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this interesting mystery.

31919,3921,87,"Beartown by Fredrik Backman starts with a damning scene that sets the stage for constant dread and leaves the reader watchful for clues as to the identity of the malevolent character in the opening scene, that you know will be readdressed at the storys zenith.

From the start, I was overwhelmed with the hopeless desperation that has settled over the town and its inhabitants.  The desolate Beartown has only junior-league hockey on which to pin its hopes and dreams.  Subsequently, the town is filled with washed-up adults who dreamed of hockey stardom only to lose all their hope in local games lost as young teenagers.  In the prime of their playing years, the boys are placed on pedestals.  They are the local sports heroes.  They are potentially the ones who will get out or make a name for the town.

In a small town, like Beartown, no one wants to be on the outside or shunned, so it is easier to remain silent and complacent about an obvious injustice or act of violence stemming from the entitlement of celebrity.  There are many victims and many bullies in Beartown; no one, adult or child, is immune from the impact.

Mr. Backman weaves an intricate story set in a stark landscape and filled with interesting characters.  He has peppered his novel with poignant social messages in a way that they are not preachy or overbearing.  Beartown is a bit of departure from the authors usual uplifting style; however, it is no less moving than his prior, more charming stories. It is equal parts an age-old and a pulled from the headlines story.  I was enthralled from start to finish, and this book haunted me for days after I finished reading.

31929,3732,765,"My enjoyment of The Thirst kind of occurred like a bell-curve: the beginning was a little slow for me and the titular character barely featured until about 50-60 pages in and then there was a somewhat tropey reluctant investigator returning to the game. But once the blood of the story really started flowing it was pretty darn exciting. There is also quite a time jump between The Thirst and Police - for a while I thought I'd missed a book (or forgotten something) which was a little confusing.

The Thirst seems heavily inspired by Harris' classic Red Dragon, complete with crooked teeth, tattoos, Hannibalesque meetings in prisons and an investigator questioning their own sanity - I wouldn't say its a rip-off but there where moments where I felt like the ground had been trodden before.

As per the bell-curve, towards the end my enjoyment tapered off. Nesbo does a good job throughout the story planting red-herrings for the mystery but I think he almost overdid it for The Thirst - when the final confrontation and reveal occurs it feels like the setup was more about providing a complete surprise rather than an earned reveal, there was no sense of ""wow I should have seen that coming"" it was more of a ""oh right I've being intentionally misled"" not to mention the scene verged on a comical court-room type drama setting which personally I feel doesn't fit with the grimy personal style of Nesbo's Harry Hole series.

And thats a shame because I liked the narrator, as unreliable as she was, she was likable and human. The supporting characters, especially the long list of sleepover boyfriends including Alex, Buckley and Enrico, could have been more developed. Clearly, they engaged with Cassie for easy sex, and Alex met an untimely end, but there was never any real rapport or at least not enough to support the plot twists. Fellow flight attendants, including Megan, seemed real enough within the framework but the relationship, which I suppose was meant to be torn asunder by the circumstances of the ending, didn't ring true. There were too many dangling clues that weren't resolved. Lipstick and lip balm under the sofa, for example. What was the reader to make of that?

31936,1332,3427,"'Is our democracy in danger?' To me, it obviously is. But perhaps that's not a bad thing - China has achieved remarkable economic growth in a very short timeframe, without democracy. Chinese experts contend this would NOT have been possible in a democracy; India was in a similar situation and democratic - it has made far less economic progress in the same period. On the other hand, autocratic rule in Germany, Venezuela

On the other hand, most relatively recent democratic breakdowns were caused not by generals and soldiers, but elected governments themselves. there have been some democracies became autocratic - with disastrous results. Examples include Germany (Hitler), Italy (Mussolini) and Venezuela (Cesar Chavez). These were achieved without majority support for authoritarianism. - Before the Nazis and Fascists seized power, less than 2% of the population were party members, and neither party achieved anything close to a majority of the vote in free and fair elections. Chavez was elected by a majority, but there is little evidence Venezuelans were looking for a strongman. (A 1998 survey found 60% of Venezuelans agreeing with 'Democracy is always the best form of government.')

Often populist outsiders test positive on a litmus test for authoritarianism. They tend to deny the legitimacy of established parties, attacking them as undemocratic and even unpatriotic. They tell voters that the existing system is not really a democracy but instead has been hijacked, corrupted, or rigged by the elite.

Four Key Indicators of Authoritarian Behavior:
1)Do they reject the Constitution or express a willingness to violate it? Do they suggest a need for antidemocratic measures, such as canceling elections, violating or suspending the Constitution, banning certain organizations, or restricting basic civil or political rights? Do they seek to use/endorse use of extraconstitutional means to change government, such as coups, violent insurrections, or mass protests? Attempt to undermine legitimacy of elections - refusing to accept credible electoral results?

2)Do they describe rivals as subversive, opposed to the existing constitutional order, constitute an existential threat - eg. to national security or the prevailing way of life? Do they baselessly describe their partisan rivals as criminals, whose supposed violation of law disqualifies them from full participation in the political arena? Do they baselessly suggest their rivals are foreign agents, secretly working in alliance with (or the employ of) a foreign government - usually an enemy one?

3)Do they have ties to armed gangs, paramilitary forces or other organizations that engage in illicit violence? Have they or their partisan allies sponsored or encouraged mob attacks on opponents? Have they tacitly endorsed violence by their supporters by refusing to unambiguously condemn and punish it?

4)Have they supported laws or policies that restrict civil liberties, such as expanded libel or defamation laws, or laws restricting protest, criticism of the government, or certain civic or political organizations? Have they threatened to take legal or other punitive action against critics in rival parties, civil society, or the media? Have they praised repressive measures taken by other governments?

Two basic norms have preserved America's checks and balances in ways we have come to take for granted - mutual toleration (understanding that competing parties accept one another as legitimate rivals, and the idea that politicians should exercise restraint in deploying their institutional prerogatives.

By the time Barack Obama became president, Many Republicans questioned his legitimacy and abandoned forbearance for winning by any means necessary. Now we have extreme partisan polarization, reinforced by conflict over race and culture. Efforts to achieve racial equality as society has grown increasingly diverse have fueled insidious reactions and intensifying polarization.

Extremist figures have long been involved in American politics. In the 1930s, up to 800 right-wing extremist groups existed in the U.S. One of the most important was Father Charles Coughlin, an anti-Semitic Catholic priest whose fiery nationalist radio program reached up to 40 million/week. He called for abolition of political parties and questioning the value of elections. His newspaper, Social Justice, named Mussolini its 'Man of the Week' in the 1930s and often defended the Nazi regime. Coughlin also delivered speeches to packed sites across the U.S. The Depression also gave rise to Louisiana governor and Senator Huey Long. Arthur Schlesinger Jr. described him as 'the great demagogue of the day.' He was a gifted stump speaker, and used a mix of bribes and threats to bring the state's legislature, judges, and press to heel. Long built a massive following with his call to redistribute wealth - in 1934 he received more mail than all other senators combined, even more than the president. Long planned a presidential run, but was assassinated in 1935.

Senator McCarthy used the Cold War fear of communist subversion to promote blacklisting, censorship, and book banning - gaining wide backing among the U.S. public. At the height of his political, polls showed nearly half of Americans approved of him, 40% even after the Senate's 1954 censure. A decade later, Alabama governor Wallace's defiant segregationist stance led him to vigorous bids for the presidency in 1968 and 1972. Roughly 40% of Americans approved of Wallace in his third-party run in 1968, and in 1972 he became a serious contender in the Democratic primaries. When derailed by an assassination attempt May 1972, he was leading McGovern by over a million primary votes.

Then party bosses avoided fringe candidates. In parliamentary democracies (eg. the U.K.), the P.M. is a member of parliament and selected by the leading parties in parliament - that virtually ensures he/she is acceptable to political insiders.

Alexander Hamilton worried that a popularly elected presidency could too easily be captured by those playing on fear and ignorance. The Electoral College was created to prevent this. However, the rise of parties in the early 1800s changed the electoral system from electing local notables as delegates to the Electoral College, but as party loyalists.

Henry Ford began his foray into politics by opposing WWI, nearly winning a Senate seat in 1918, and toying with the idea of running for president in 1924. 'Collier's' began a weekly national poll of readers, and at the end of a two-month straw pol of upward of 250,000 readers Ford outpaced all 12 contenders - including President Harding and future president Hoover. However, its poll of a group of 116 party leaders in both parties Ford fell to a distant fifth position. Huey Long probably would have been similarly blocked, if he'd lived long enough. Wallace had the approval of about 40% of Americans, but knowing the Democratic Party would never back his candidacy, he ran as an independent, which doomed him.

The turning point came in 1968. Democrats became divided between  LBJ's foreign policy and those favoring Robert Kennedy's antiwar position. Party insiders dominated the convention floor and favored Humphrey, who had not run in any primary and had supported LBJ's policies. Following Humphrey's 1968 defeat, a system of binding presidential primaries was adopted. Similarly with Republicans.

Jesse Jackson, Pat Robertson,  Pat Buchanan, and Steve Forbes then ran in varying years, and all lost. Turned out they lacked the ability to attract enough donors, newspaper editors, interest groups, and state-level politicians.

Then came Donald Trump. Despite concerns, most Republican leaders (especially those currently in office) ended up remaining silent or endorsing the party line. Once the election became a 'normal' race, it was a toss-up because the country had become increasingly polarized.

For outsiders, particularly those of a demagogic bent, democratic politics is often intolerably frustrating. Demagogues attack critics as subversives, terrorists, enemies. Journalists become targets.

Having the referees on your side helps. Most often, the capture of the referees is done by quietly firing civil servants and other nonpartisan officials and replacing them loyalists. Institutions that cannot be easily purged may be subtly hijacked. Peru's Fujimori's ""intelligence advisor"" videotaped opposition politicians, judges congressmen, businessmen, journalists paying/receiving bribes or engaging in other illicit activity and then used the videotapes to blackmail them. He also maintained many others on his payroll, in secret. Those who couldn't be bought off became impeachment targets - eg. for Peron and Fujimori. Court packing is another means of bypassing independent judges - eg. Hungary and Poland. Chavez razed existing courts and created new ones.

Most elected autocrats also buy off potential opponents - cooperative media gain privileged access or are put on the government's payroll (Fujimori), friendly business executives may receive profitable concessions/contracts, and politicians are bought (eg. Fujimori vs. legislators intending to vote against him). Charges of inciting violence, libel/defamation suits (Ecuador's Correa), tax evasion fines (Turkey's Erdogan, Russia's Putin, Venezuela's Chavez), and/or bullying/buying-off cultural figures (Venezuela's Chavez) are also used. Authoritarians also reform the constitution, the electoral system, implement gerrymandering (Malaysia, Hungary, and other institutions. Disenfranchisement via 'neutral' poll taxes, property requirements, literacy tests, and complex written ballots - Southern U.S. states, overcoming minority strength. Crises, even invented ones - Bush II saw his approval rating soar from 53% to 90%, after 9/11, Bush I after the Gulf War crisis, Hitler after the 1933 Reichstag fire, Putin in 1999 after bombings supposedly by Chechen terrorists, Erdogan after ISIS attacks in 2015.

U.S. constitutional checks and balances were designed to prevent concentrating and abusing power - Lincoln's concentration of power during the Civil War, Nixon's illegal wiretapping, and FDR's power-grabs notwithstanding. However, well-designed constitutions sometimes fail - eg. Germany's 1919 Weimar constitution, Latin American and the Philippines' (in 1935) nations modeling themselves on the U.S. Immense national wealth, unwritten norms, and a large middle class have helped avoid a similar fate in the U.S. The authors also assert that in almost every case of democratic breakdown they studied, consolidation of power was justified by labeling opponents as a threat.

A second norm critical to democracy's survival is 'institutional forbearance' - avoiding actions that violate the spirit of the law. Examples - presidential term-limits in the U.S. (pre-FDR), what constitutes 'malfeasance' in impeachment proceedings (Argentina's Peron), considering an opposition-president's Supreme Court nominations (U.S., March 2016 after Justice Scalia died), use of 'legal loopholes.' America's democratic norms, however, were born in a context of exclusion. The process of racial inclusion that began after WWII and culminated in the 1964 Civil Rights Act and 1965 Voting Rights Act fully democratized the U.S., but also polarized it.

Newt Gingrich's 1978 third bid for office in a district outside Atlanta  is 'credited' as beginning norm erosion in America. He rejected established norms of civility and cooperation, instead using politics as warfare and using over-the-top rhetoric. He described Congress as 'corrupt' and 'sick,' questioning Democratic rivals' patriotism, used a new PAC (GOPAC) to spread those tactics across the party via over 2,000 training audiotapes - combined with memos to Republican candidates instructing them to use certain negative words to describe Democrats (eg. pathetic, sick, bizarre, betray, anti-flag, antifamily). He became a successful McCarthyite.

Filibuster numbers soared, an aggressive push for investigations into scandals began, and a 'no compromise' focus on ideological purity brought government shutdowns in 1995 and 1996 and a 1998 impeachment of Clinton for Clinton's testimony regarding Lewinsky. (The House also conducted 140 hours of sworn testimony investigating if Clinton had abused the White House Christmas card list in an effort to drum up new donors.) Power shifted to House Majority Leader Tom DeLay after Gingrich left - his K Street Project packed lobbying firms with Republican operatives and rewarded lobbyists with legislation based on their support for GOP officeholders. DeLay's philosophy was 'If it wasn't illegal, do it.'  Bush II governed hard to the right, per Rove's advice that the electorate was so polarized that Republicans could win by mobilizing their own base rather than seeking independent voters. Democrats eschewed cooperation in favor of obstruction, with the exception of 9/11. Senate Democrats also obstructed an unprecedented number of judicial nominees - either outright, through filibusters, or by not holding hearings.

Beginning in the 1960s, the U.S. experienced a massive wave of immigration, first from Latin America and later from Asia. In 1950, nonwhites constituted barely 10% of U.S. population, 38% by 2014, and a forecasted majority by 2044. The nonwhite share of Democratic vote rose from 7% in the 1950s to 44% in 2012, with Republicans still nearly 90% white into the 2000s.

Meanwhile, Evangelicals entered politics en masse in the late 1970s, motivated largely by the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. White Evangelicals in 2016 were 76% identified as Republicans, and Democratic voters grew increasingly secular. (White Democrats who attended church regularly fell from nearly 50% in the 1960s to < 30% in the 2000s.) Thus, the two parties are now divided over both race and religion, two polarizing issues. In 2010, 69% of Republican voters were Fox News viewers; also popular radio talk-show hosts such a Limbaugh, Hannity, Savage, and Laura Ingraham. Loosening of campaign finance laws in 2010 brought outside groups such as Americans for Prosperity and the American energy Alliance into outsize influence. (In 2012 alone, the Koch family spent about $400 million on elections.)

'Status anxiety' occurs when social status, identity and sense of belong are perceived to be under threat, bringing overheated, overaggressive, and apocalyptic politics.

During Trump's first year in office he called the media the 'enemy of the American people,' questioned judges' legitimacy, and threatened to cut federal funding to major cities. During his first week in office, Trump asked Comey to drop investigations into Michael Flynn, and pressed others to intervene in Comey's investigation and to deny the existence of any collusion with Russia. Trump then tried to establish a personal relationship with then Manhattan-based U.S. Attorney Bharara, whose investigations into money laundering threatened to reach Trump's inner circle. He also attacked judges who ruled against him. Then came attacks on the Office of Government Ethics, leading to the resignation of its director. Next - threats to 'open up the libel laws' vs. the New York Times, antitrust authority as leverage against CNN and Amazon/WP, and challenging the license of NBC and other networks. Making it harder for low-income minority to vote was accompanied by claims that if their illegal votes were removed, Trump would also win the popular vote.

31938,473,3920,"Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain, written by Pete Egoscue with Roger Gittines, offers a realistic and common-sense explanation of human physiology and reasons why we experience pain. By using gentle, specific exercises and stretches, chronic pain often can be treated without the use of drugs, surgery or extensive physical therapy.

Pete Egoscue, a physiologist and sports injury consultant, outlines practical, powerful E-cises aimed at specific problem areas: feet, ankles, knees, hips, backs, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, neck and head. Each chapter contains specific exercises with illustrations. The exercises are not aimed at gaining strength, but rather putting unused muscles back to work.

Before doing the exercises, it is important to know why certain parts of the body cause pain. Pain tells us something is not happening that should be happening, and often what is not happening is adequate motion. Modern living makes it possible to function without going through the physical motions to accomplish daily tasks. It is true: the less we move, the less we are capable of moving. The bodys design, its foundation and framework, the musculoskeletal system, comprises of muscles, joints, bones, and nerves. For a properly functioning body, we must employ all the body.

Readers are encouraged to thoroughly read at least the first three chapters, then zero in on the particular body part that causes pain. The final chapter outlines ways we can stay pain free, to customize our daily routine to include the type of motion that will keep our entire body pain free.

I found Pain Free a valuable resource. Egoscues straight-forward approach to healthy living makes sense. Whether in pain, or just interested in maintaining a healthy body, Pain Free offers an understanding of the human body and its intended functions.",1522022400,5,pain free revolutionari method stop chronic pain written pete egoscu roger gittin offer realist commonsens explan human physiolog reason experi pain use gentl specif exercis stretch chronic pain often treat without use drug surgeri extens physic therapi pete egoscu physiologist sport injuri consult outlin practic power ecis aim specif problem area foot ankl knee hip back shoulder elbow wrist hand neck head chapter contain specif exercis illustr exercis aim gain strength rather put unus muscl back work exercis import know certain part bodi caus pain pain tell u someth happen happen often happen adequ motion modern live make possibl function without go physic motion accomplish daili task true le move le capabl move bodi design foundat framework musculoskelet system compris muscl joint bone nerv properli function bodi must employ bodi reader encourag thoroughli read least first three chapter zero particular bodi part caus pain final chapter outlin way stay pain free custom daili routin includ type motion keep entir bodi pain free found pain free valuabl resourc egoscu straightforward approach healthi live make sen whether pain interest maintain healthi bodi pain free offer understand human bodi intend function

31949,1144,1153,"Just a few weeks ago, I finished reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder/dp/0375869026/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder</a>&nbsp;and I loved it so much, I wanted to read more about Auggie and everyone in the story! I debated reading this book because I was afraid it might be a letdown after reading Wonder but I decided to get it from the library. I just finished it last night and I loved it!

Auggie & Me: Three Wonder Stories is a collection of stories about three characters we meet in Wonder but whom we really don't know a lot about. Please note, this book is NOT a sequel to Wonder. The stories in this book focus on Julian, Christopher, and Charlotte. In Wonder, we hear about them but we don't really get to know them and why they are the way they are. This book accomplishes that. Auggie & Me really delves into the lives of those three characters, as well as a few others who are often with those people so we get a bigger picture of what's going on in the entire world of Wonder.

This book is about the same length as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder/dp/0375869026/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder</a>, which is just over 300 pages so it will help satisfy your craving for more Wonder stories. It's told in the same way as Wonder and is a very enjoyable read. I definitely suggest reading Wonder first and then this book because Wonder will give you a good storyline and you will get to know all of the characters first. Then, this book focuses on three characters whose stories are important to the world of Auggie and his friends.

Overall, I'm glad I read this book and I enjoyed the time I spent reading it!

I decided to listen to the audiobook version of the mystery, as Dan Stevens was the narrator and I thought his performance in Beauty and the Beast was spectacular. He did a fantastic job bringing each of the characters to life, although I feel that this story would have been wonderful with a full cast. Just a warning though, there are many recordings of this tale and you might be listening to another narrator like Kenneth Branagh (who played Poirot in the recent movie) or David Suchet.

The story itself was engaging and not on the nose. There were aspects of the mystery that I deduced for myself, as clues were revealed and conversations overheard but I didn't figure everything out before the reveal. That was really nice because sometimes mysteries don't end up being an actual mystery. I even found myself yelling at Poirot's companions because they clearly were missing some of the facts and sometimes he had to lay things out for them very plainly.

When she develops a crush on a rock star, her imagination has a budding romance forming and she begins to transform herself with new clothes, a new haircut and a bikini wax... which was a humorous adventure.

After years of lonliness, she begins to develop friendships with a man she works with and soon meets his delightful mother. Eleanor Oliphant and Raymond then help to save an elderly man who has fallen on the street and later find themselves involved with his family.

There is a bit of drama, and a touch of a psychological thriller, and although it was fairly easy to figure out how all of that turns out, the story was still quite good.

31966,4761,501,"You know when you pick up a book because it was a suggestion by a celebrity and you're not really sure what to expect? This was the case for me with this book. I picked it up because Reese Witherspoon's book club pick was Erotic Stores for Punjabi Widows for the month of March. When I read the synopsis I thought hmm this will be different. And it was...in a good way!

This story is about a lot of different kinds of Punjabi women trying to find their way. It's set in London but also references India in some parts. We meet Nikki who was supposed to follow a certain career path based on her Dad's wishes but she ends up working at a Bar instead. She goes down to the temple one day and see's a listing for an English class teacher. This is a free class and is offered to the widows in the community. Nikki thinks she is going to teach them how to read and write English but she's in for a big surprise when they start ""telling their stories""

While this is happening we are also trying to figure out a mystery. Nikki's boss had a daughter who is no longer alive. There are a lot of theories going around the community but Nikki helps uncover some new information that may just incriminate the right person(s). However, she has to be careful because the ""brothers"" of the community are watching her...

As you can see this story is two fold. Theres a romance side (erotic stories, I mean it is in the name) and a mystery to be ironed out. I went into this story not knowing much about the Punjabi culture but if there's any truth to it then I really want to hang out with these widows! They are saucy and I loved it. Romance is not something I read very often but this had just the right amount to keep it spicy but also keep you invested in the overall story.

31968,1325,2729,"Are you reading the Expanse series? Yes? Good. No? Well, maybe you should reconsider.

Seven books in, and the Expanse is still going strong. A lot of times series start to loose their way or collapse under their own weight. But the Expanse clearly has an end goal in mind, and somehow it always manages to convincingly up the stakes. Oh, and be forewarned  therell potentially be spoilers for earlier books from here on out.

Before I can talk about literally anything else, I need to address the most obvious thing about Persepolis Rising: the time jump. It skips thirty years in between books! What the heck! I had soooo many feelings about this. I tend to have a hard time adjusting to time jumps, both in books and TV shows. All the characters have changed and everythings so different! But in the case of Persepolis Rising, I can see why James S.A. Corey made the decision. Thirty years gives enough time for the galaxy (and beyond) to recover from the war and for a new status quo to emerge. Of course, it also gives time for the break-away Martian military on Laconia to prepare to wreck that status quo. Remember those people? The ones everyone was sort of content to forget about? Yeah, well they're back and aiming to conquer all of humanity.

If Persepolis Rising doesnt quite rise to the heights of Nemesis Games, that might just be a testament to how good Nemesis Games was (plus its hard to beat the gut-shock of the asteroid hitting Earth). If possible, the situation in Persepolis Rising might be even worse. The Laconians have new technology fueled by the proto-molecule, things no one has ever seen before. With all the books in the Expanse series, Ive been sure that the crew of the Rocinante will somehow save the day, that the villains will be defeated, and that the galaxy will be better for it. I haven't given up hope that our heroes will win out, but Persepolis Rising makes me question it. If Nemesis Games and Bablyons Ashes were the stories of a war for survival, Persepolis Rising is the story of resistance. What do you do when the bad guys win?

Of course, the heart of the Expanse is the characters, and Ill always be happy to spend time with the crew of the Rocinante. Thirty-years have brought some changes. Most heart-breaking is that Clarissa has become ill from those implants she installed so many years before. Shes not much longer for the world, and Amos is loosing his cool. With Amos, thats really not a good thing. But theres other changes too. Holden and Naomi are (gasp!) thinking of retiring and leaving the ship to Bobbie. I know, things really must have changed! Its hard to imagine Holden having a quiet life of leisure. However, this does mean that we end up with one of my favorite tropes: one last job before retirement.

While Persepolis Rising follows in Bablyons Ashes footsteps by having a looser hand with POV structure, there are a few main perspectives. Holden, as usual, but also Bobbie, whom Ill forever love. She might be aging and slowing down, but shes still a badass. Persepolis Rising also moves a minor character from previous books into center stage: Drummer, the woman I mainly remember as Fred Johnsons assistant. Shes head of the transportation union and one of the most powerful people in the universe. Her lifes looking pretty great, until, all of a sudden, it really doesnt. It took me a while to warm up to Drummer, but by the end, Id come to like her. I hope we see more of her going forward. Otherwise, weve got an entirely new character as one of our central POVs. Singh is a Laconian who completely believes in their plan to conquer the galaxy and rigidly adheres to the rules, even when it involves killing people. The question hanging over Singhs chapters is whether hell have some self-realizations about what hes doing. Will he continue down the path hes started on, or will he turn to the light? Hes not a character I like, but I did find his perspective interesting.

Persepolis Rising is a new stage for the series. The scale has really shifted since the first book. Things have gotten so much more intense, so much more vast, so much more (dare I say it) expansive. This new plotline is a thrilling addition to the series, even if it does occasionally hit me right in the feels. Seven books in, and I still desperately want the next installment.

Walter Mosleys description of that time on Rikers Island is graphic and unforgettable. Later Joe will become a private investigator. Hes a broken man, but still has the heart and skills of a cop.

He takes on two cases, one to exonerate himself, the other to exonerate a presumed cop killer. His journey through these investigations makes him the target of wildly dangerous men and dangerously frightened men. It also brings him surprising allies. Joe makes both friends and enemies wherever he goes.

Joes relationships with his adoring daughter and his hostile ex-wife are full of interest. His casual encounters with attractive women are often surprising.  His partner in the investigation is an ex-criminal, baddest of the bad, with a weirdly mystical bent.

Mosley manages to be lyrical, philosophical, and gritty by turns. His voice is unique, the rhythm of his prose mesmerizing. He conveys the dangers of being a black man in America with subtle force.

31976,4346,1234,"Dragonflight is the first book in The Dragonriders of Pern trilogy, and I found it included a small dose of science fiction and liberal amounts of fantasy to create the world of Pern.  Although the original inhabitants came to Pern via a space ship, the current ones have devolved quite a bit to wielding swords and riding dragons!  The novel asks the reader to suspend their beliefs multiple times throughout the story, and there are several dues ex machina moments where the characters discover or rediscover some secret knowledge that saves the day.

Given Amazon offers the book in School & Library binding format, Im going to guess the author wrote this for a young adult audience.  There are some inferred sexual references and some bloodshed in the novel, but overall, it is a clean story.  There is a bit of a coming-of-age sense to the story as well as the reader follows an orphan named Lessa and her plot to avenge her familys death.

This does follow Dylan and does follow PTSD a little more than book one.  It also takes a very different turn around child abuse.  Since I work in child abuse, I hate when stories put Social Services in a negative light, so this did disappoint me.

This one does focus a little more around church and God than book one, but I still do not feel it was too overwhelming.

31981,356,462,"I hate to admit that I am influenced by reviews written by people who are Russian and also those who are Russian historians. They claim that this book, which is a novel, did not paint a true picture of Russia at this time in history.  I do not know and cannot judge these criticisms. I enjoyed the book, and felt Towles did a fine job of writing. The Count is a wonderful character.  Life at the grand Metropol  hotel is never dull.
The fact that Count Alexander Rostov's life sentence is to never leave the hotel, did seem to be soft hearted, when compared to everybody else's sentence of death or life in prison. Therefore, the book is about day to day life at the Metropol.  The Count is content and there did not seem to be much of a story.  I kept feeling that there was no plot, it was more like a diary, which was ok because I was enjoying the read.  There was a wealth of historical information, which interfered with the activities at the Metropol.  Every book or movie should have a dog, cat or child.  ""A Gentleman in Moscow"" has a child.  Nina, also a hotel guest, is a delightful young girl and adds to the story and to the Count's life. Time passes and Nina returns and leaves her daughter Sofia for a short visit with the Count. but Nina does not return and Count Rostov becomes Sofia's Papa'.  Rostov is not poor he has a desk with hollow legs, and the legs are filled with gold coins. All in all life is pretty good for Count Alexander Rostov, at the Metropol with his gold coins and his darling daughter.  You will meet  the hotel staff, who become family to our prisoner.  There is a great appreciation of food, because the Count is a gourmet and the best food in Russia is served at the famous Boyarsky, which is in the hotel.

31984,3058,3231,"I was immediately drawn into Everless because the cover was so intriguing. The detail of the world within the hourglass drew me in and I wasn't disappointed by the story. The premise was unique: time is currency in this world and can be harnessed from your blood. As in most societies, there is incredible stratification and inequality. The poor must sell their time to survive while the rich horde time and live for hundreds of years.

The main character Jules finds herself in the employ of one of the wealthy families and embroiled in more trouble than she ever expected. Despite the fact that her father always warned her against returning to the Gerling estate, she didn't listen and hoped that she could make enough while in their service to give her father more time. She is both fiercely loyal and trusting, which is not always a positive in this environment. I found her to be likable and rooted for her success or survival.

There were aspects of the plot that I found to be a little formulaic and to be expected, but others that surprised me.

31985,3058,1951,"The Eye of the World is the first of a fourteen-part fantasy series (not including companion novels). If that isn't daunting enough, it is an epic fantasy chronicling a hero's journey with a whole lot of world to discover. I chose to listen to the first book via audiobook and it was 30 hours long. Despite the fact that I enjoyed listening to the narrator's version of the tale it was still a really long time to dedicate to one book. For reference, my physical copy has about 820 pages although the last few are an extensive glossary.

It's depth and span make this book difficult to review and rate. Overall, I enjoyed the story and am very interested to see where the plot goes but there were also issues throughout. The pacing oscillated between break-neck speed and plodding steps. My biggest issue was the fact that the climax and end of the book took a few pages to chronicle. With a book that is over 800 pages long, it felt like an incredible letdown. We spent so long building up to this moment and it wasn't given the proper time to cement itself in our consciousness. It seemed too easy.

There was also a very large cast of characters with unique names that took a while to get used to. I spent a good portion of the beginning of the book (and some moments strewn throughout my read as new characters were introduced) attempting to remember who was who. Despite that, I felt that our core group of characters were each unique in their personalities and motivations. I can see them having a lot of room to develop over the course of fourteen novels.

Even though this is a relatively formulaic fantasy, following a hero's journey and fighting a big bad called the Dark One - I did enjoy my time reading the Eye of the World. It is definitely an intimidating world to dive into, so I don't know when I will get around to reading the next book in the series (which I hear is even better than the first) but I know I will get around to it eventually.",1522022400,4,eye world first fourteenpart fantasi seri includ companion novel isnt daunt enough epic fantasi chronicl hero journey whole lot world discov chose listen first book via audiobook 30 hour long despit fact enjoy listen narrat version tale still realli long time dedic one book refer physic copi 820 page although last extens glossari depth span make book difficult review rate overal enjoy stori interest see plot goe also issu throughout pace oscil breakneck speed plod step biggest issu fact climax end book took page chronicl book 800 page long felt like incred letdown spent long build moment wasnt given proper time cement conscious seem easi also larg cast charact uniqu name took get use spent good portion begin book moment strewn throughout read new charact introduc attempt rememb despit felt core group charact uniqu person motiv see lot room develop cours fourteen novel even though rel formula fantasi follow hero journey fight

31991,15,3283,"Richardson is mildly introspective in this book as she faces aging, menopause, grief, change and discontent.  The book is a light and sparse journal she keeps while confronting the next chapter in her life, and what to do with her conflicting feelings.  The reader gets a small glimpse into her life, her thoughts and daily routines.  Richardson takes the reader on her long walks in nature, and her pursuit of beautiful surroundings and simple pleasures, hungry for solitude and contemplation.  This resonated with me, and many women will recognize themselves in Richardsons desire for a simpler life.  Yet, Richardson writes from a bit of a remove, as if she is observing herself experiencing life, and then recoding it.  Her writing can be soothing and comforting, but I wanted her to mine the darker material at the root of her restlessness, and instead, she skims the surface, touching on issues, but without significant depth.  She is earnest, but the insights are somewhat tepid.  What I found most striking was that Richardson seems to be re-learning the same concepts and ideas that launched her career -  the importance of self-care, finding your voice, living authentically and pursuing what matters most.  This demonstrates that we are all continually learning the same things over and over in a lifetime.  Growth is constant and on-going.  Richardsons book explores the universeal struggles that many women face a midlife, juggling demands and shifting priorities amid a changing personal landscape.  Richardsons anxiety was often palpable to me as she wrestled with frequent work-related travel that no longer energized her.  The reader can feel her conflict at giving herself permission to travel less, as she longs to be home instead. Clearly, she still vacillates between doing what is expected of her versus what she truly needs.  This is the bane of us all.
Richardson also confronts the issue of mortality, and here too, her anxiety is apparent.  She even speculates on how many actual seasons she may have left on the planet.  This aspect was difficult for me to relate to, and Im in her age bracket.  I just don't feel the urgency of the hurry up and drink life in because this is all going to end soon mindset.  I say this as a cancer survivor and as one who has experienced the deaths of both parents and of  friends.  I agree with savoring lifes true magic, but i don't count the number of summers that may remain with trepidation.  Death is inevitable and loss can be excruciatingly painful, but life is still a glorious, difficult, devastating and wonderful banquet.  Midlife can be different for everyone, for some a reinvigoration, for others, a winding-down or somewhere in between.  Yes, life becomes more poignant as the years pass, but dwelling on the time thats left seems premature at Richardsons 54 years, and robs today of its sweetness, joy and potential.  I found myself wanting to tell her to stop worrying, take a deep breath and just enjoy life.",1522022400,3,richardson mildli introspect book face age menopaus grief chang discont book light spar journal keep confront next chapter life conflict feel reader get small glimps life thought daili routin richardson take reader long walk natur pursuit beauti surround simpl pleasur hungri solitud contempl reson mani woman recogn richardson desir simpler life yet richardson write bit remov observ experienc life recod write sooth comfort want mine darker materi root restless instead skim surfac touch issu without signific depth earnest insight somewhat tepid found strike richardson seem relearn concept idea launch career import selfcar find voic live authent pursu matter demonstr continu learn thing lifetim growth constant ongo richardson book explor univers struggl mani woman face midlif juggl demand shift prioriti amid chang person landscap richardson anxieti often palpabl wrestl frequent workrel travel longer energ reader feel conflict give permiss travel le long home instead clearli still vacil expect versu truli need bane

31995,1287,3419,"I put off reading this book for a while because I figured that no matter how well it was written, it would be a little bit tricky because of the subject matter- very few books about two dead parents written by a surviving child are not wrapped up in deep emotion. So I was absolutely shocked when I sat down with Anya Yurchyshyn's book and immediately found myself not wanting to put it down- in fact, I found myself making time to read it, which I rarely can do these days.

Yurchyshyn doesn't go easy on her parents- both her mother and father were extremely complicated people who weren't exactly nurturing and supportive of her, and her home environment was terse, at the best. And her mother and father were living on separate continents for a majority of their relationship. However, something about them motivated Yurchyshyn to dig a little deeper into their lives after they both passed away, and what she found radically altered her perception of them as parents and as people.

The beauty of the book is despite the truth of her parents' lives and relationship, Yurchyshyn recognizes that in no way does that excuse her mother and father from their behavior towards her and her sister. I appreciated that- many books about this topic tend to end with the authors saying that they found a sense of peace in their complicated (often abusive) relationship with their parents and was able to let it all go simply because they realized their parents were flawed humans, like the rest of us. I know we're all doing the best we can, especially those of us who are parents, but I still think we have an obligation to our kids to do the best we can by them. Neglect and abuse can't be excused by personality quirks, and I was relieved that Yurchyshyn didn't go that route, which concerned me a little as I started reading the book. It's clear she had a rough time as the daughter or these two people, and nothing that she learned about them could change that about her experience.

Even though this book tackles a lot of really tough stuff (neglect, sexual abuse, alcoholism, government corruption, a possible murder) it was remarkably readable and compelling. I didn't find the need to take a breather or take a break from the book for a few days to kind of wash the heaviness off me- despite the fact that I didn't like Yurchyshyn's parents, I was heavily invested in this book and couldn't put it down until I finished it.

31996,4410,3468,"Cameron Harris is a patriotic young man who goes to Afghanistan and returns home paralyzed from the waist down after stepping on an IED. When Jonathan Miles's new novel, Anatomy of a Miracle opens he is back in his hometown of Biloxi, Mississippi living with his sister Tanya. Days are spent watching TV, smoking, taking the cornucopia of pills he's been prescribed, and drinking beer. It is on when of their trips to the nearby convenience store, the Biz-E-Bee, as Tanya is inside buying Cap'n Crunch, that Cameron gets an odd feeling in the lower half of his body, and thenstands. And walks. Just a few steps because he's been paralyzed for four years, but it is enough to turn their quiet town upside down. And much like the landmine that severed his spine, these steps blow Cameron's life apart.
It doesn't take long for the ripple effect of Cameron's recovery to spread. Initially, a local reporter shows up, which spurs a call from Cameron's VA doctor, Janice Lorimar-Cuevas, and a visit to her office where, as a doctor, she is at a loss to explain how a spinal cord could regenerate itself. There is no answer in Cameron's MRIs nor any historical precedent, but as a doctor she is unable to use the word 'miracle'. There must be some explanation and she's determined to find it.
As Cameron slowly begins to adjust to his new situation the ripples turn into waves. A local priest shows up and subjects Cameron and Tanya to rigorous questioning that is the prelude to a long-dead American priest being nominated for sainthood. The owners of the Biz-E-Bee find their small store besieged with tour buses of the faithful showing up to stand in the spot where Cameron rose and taking photos of everything in the area. In response, they stop stocking supplies the regulars buy and go all-in on religious memorabilia, watching as they go from being near bankruptcy to making money for the first time in their lives.
The waves become a tsunami when Hollywood steps in and a director approaches Cameron to star in a reality show (to be called The Miracle Man) that will document his life going forward as he searches for answers to his healing. It's no surprise that this goes from possibly being of merit to Cameron getting veneers for his teeth and Tanya becoming the show's focus because she's got more personality. Filming takes over their lives, spinning them out of control until reality becomes unreal.
With such an intriguing and controversial subject Miles could lead Anatomy straight over a cliff of the absurd. Instead, he presents an average man who is not religious, but self-aware enough to know that if he's being held up as a miracle either he ought to have done something to deserve it or he'd better do something bigger with his life now. He chooses the supporting cast just as carefully, with the VA doctor representing the world of facts and science and an Italian investigator from the Vatican representing religion. Miles doesn't take the easy route of making them caricatures but gives both welcome depth and the same mission-to find the truth, as difficult as it may be.
How Miles draws together such a cast of opposites and varied beliefs is one of the best aspects of Anatomy. You have science, religion, and capitalism all converging on a 26-year-old man with a high school education who freely admits he has no understanding of what's happened or how it could happen or what it means. Mostly, he wants to understand how this could happen. What he is not ready for is people delving into his past and here Miles adds another surprising element to the story. One that doesn't rely on shock value or taking the easy way out. Instead, it complicates the story and gives the reader even more to contemplate-something I relish in a novel. Which is why, in all its messy, contradictory, humanity, Anatomy of a Miracle is an intelligent, humorous, deeply rewarding novel, regardless of your take on miracles.",1522022400,5,cameron harri patriot young man goe afghanistan return home paralyz waist step i jonathan mile new novel anatomi miracl open back hometown biloxi mississippi live sister tanya day spent watch tv smoke take cornucopia pill he prescrib drink beer trip nearbi conveni store bizebe tanya insid buy capn crunch cameron get odd feel lower half bodi thenstand walk step he paralyz four year enough turn quiet town upsid much like landmin sever spine step blow cameron life apart doesnt take long rippl effect cameron recoveri spread initi local report show spur call cameron va doctor janic lorimarcueva visit offic doctor loss explain spinal cord could regener answer cameron mri histor preced doctor unabl use word miracl must explan she determin find cameron slowli begin adjust new situat rippl turn wave local priest show subject cameron tanya rigor question prelud longdead american priest nomin sainthood owner bizebe find small store besieg tour buse faith show stand spot cameron rose take photo everyth

32004,1260,20,"seriously wonder if Ms Ng was ever taught any morals and in fact if she undestands human nature at all.  We are led to presume that Mia in her opinion is a character to be admired.  To many of us in fact she is portrayed as a completely selfish and egotistical person that has no thought or regards for the feelings of others.  She has complete control over the life style of her Daughter, leaving her without friends or other family members.  I found nothing likeable about her character at all.  Apart from which Ms NG's views on the well being of a child leads us to the opinion that she is in fact a spoilt wealthy brat that has never gone without a meal or had to wear old clothes  or suffer in a broken family.  I assure you Ms Ng that very many children that have been adopted by parents of other cultures, religions, colour are far better off than the many left with their birth mothers.  At least when they mature they have the chouce to search for their roots or pick their own religion, culture, language.  This whole story is so flawed it's pathetic.  To my mind it is simply another liberal view of life from a person that has no idea how the other half lives.  This has happened in the UK and we now have over 00,000 children under the watchful eyes of the NSPCC, simply because ools like Ms Ng think that a birth Mother is better than a decent and caring home.  We have kiddies now with Mothers that are drug addicts, alcoholics, bearing children without even knowing the names of the fathers and all because we have rich spoilt women that think bearing a child must mean you love them more.
I give a big well done to all women that give their children for adoption, knowing that they cannot give them the opportunity of a good and decent life.  I assure you Ms Ng, that the majority that in the past were adopted, during the war, from migrants, from orphanages and from unmarried Mothers are very grateful.
I found this whole book distasteful and a pity Ms Ng never considered that all us boring Mothers and Fathers that work hard to give our kiddies a good life, also pay out our taxes to help those in need whereas your so called heroine did nothing but cause mayhem and treated her own parents, and anyone that crossed her path disgracefully.",1522022400,1,serious wonder m ng ever taught moral fact undestand human natur led presum mia opinion charact admir mani u fact portray complet selfish egotist person thought regard feel other complet control life style daughter leav without friend famili member found noth likeabl charact apart m ng view well child lead u opinion fact spoilt wealthi brat never gone without meal wear old cloth suffer broken famili assur m ng mani child adopt parent cultur religion colour far better mani left birth mother least matur chouc search root pick religion cultur languag whole stori flaw pathet mind simpli anoth liber view life person idea half live happen uk 00000 child watch eye nspcc simpli ool like m ng think birth mother better decent care home kiddi mother drug addict alcohol bear child without even know name father rich spoilt woman think bear child must mean love

32008,3058,1101,"Re-Read (Audiobook) Review: I loved this book, even more, the second time that I read it. I chose to experience it via audiobook, rather than physically reading it which is what I did the first time. The audiobook is a full cast recording and it is absolutely fantastic. Although I recommend also having the book (or digital version) with you while listening to follow along when you can. This book is written in such a unique way that it really should be experienced visually as well. There are chat logs, images, diagrams, redacted information and other things that just don't come across in the audio. That being said, this is one of the best audiobooks that I've ever experienced and I highly recommend it. The full cast and sound effects completely immerse you in the story and raise the stakes.

The two main characters, Ezra and Kady were well fleshed out and relatable. Kady is a fierce femme who does whatever it takes for the people she loves and doesn't let anyone push her around. She is incredibly brave and sometimes too confident for her own good. I enjoyed the fact that they had a pre-established romance in the story because that's not super common in YA. Characters usually meet and fall madly in love over the course of the books. We were able to meet characters that already knew one another and were struggling through the reality of life.

As this was a reread, I was immediately drawn back into the narrative and didn't experience the pacing issues that some people seem to have with the book. There is a lot of world to build and develop in the first third of the book, which makes the narrative a little slow although it's still fascinating. Once you get to know the characters and are completely invested in the story, the action (and horror) ramps up.

I fell even more in love with this book than I did the first time I read it. This is my favourite pure science fiction series and highly recommend it to people. I suggest listening to the audiobook whilst looking at the pages because that is honestly the best way to experience this story.

Original Mini-Review: The layout of this book was so unique - rather than a straight narrative, you were able to experience the story through short bursts via IM chats, 3rd-party observations while transcribing security video, and AI logs. The characters developed over the course of the novel, but it was surprisingly the artificial intelligence A.I.D.E.N. that stole the show. It was an enjoyable story and the plot wasn't predictable. I highly recommend the book to fans of young adult/teen novels, science fiction and truly well thought out narratives",1522022400,5,reread audiobook review love book even second time read chose experi via audiobook rather physic read first time audiobook full cast record absolut fantast although recommend also book digit version listen follow along book written uniqu way realli experienc visual well chat log imag diagram redact inform thing dont come across audio said one best audiobook ive ever experienc highli recommend full cast sound effect complet immers stori rais stake two main charact ezra kadi well flesh relat kadi fierc femm whatev take peopl love doesnt let anyon push around incred brave sometim confid good enjoy fact preestablish romanc stori that super common ya charact usual meet fall madli love cours book abl meet charact alreadi knew one anoth struggl realiti life reread immedi drawn back narr didnt experi pace issu peopl seem book lot world build develop first third book make narr littl slow although still fascin get

32014,604,3556,"TL;DR: PLEASE JUST READ THE BOOK. It's amazing.

My review for this book was actually a buddy read interview format, so I'm sharing a few of the questions and answers with you.

If you could describe Arm of the Sphinx in 4 words what would they be?

Well, heck, Arm of the Sphinx deserves a loooooot more than just 4 words But lets try. Tense Dynamic. Character-driven. Unexpected! That would be it. I found this book to be much more dynamic than Senlin Ascends, and the tension was too much sometimes! (I prefer slower books, although that is often not the case with other readers.) But just like Senlin Ascends, Arm of the Sphinx remains extremely character-driven, maybe even more so than the first book. And unexpected, because, hell This is roughly how the book went: TWIST. TWIST. ANOTHER TWIST. I won't even start talking about the ending.

Most of the time, people complain about the sequel curse, where the sequel is always worse compared to the first book. Did you think that was the case for Arm of The Sphinx?

Actually, I don't think this book suffered The Second Book Syndrome at all! It was just as great as the first one, although in slightly different ways. In fact, I think a lot of readers will like it more  because it has much more movement, adventure and just generally picks up the pace, compared to Senlin Ascends. I missed certain aspects of the first book, but then again, other things made up for it! I cant wait for the third book. There was just so much swashbuckling in this one though!

Would you recommend people this series even if the third book is not out yet? And why?

Oh yes! Definitely yes. Why? Because its how I read it. Its amazing to be there and see it grow and expand its fanbase! When it just started out self-published, it made it onto the lists of underrated gems, I instantly knew it would be big one day. And I wanted to be there to see it. You will probably agree that its not as cool to be reading a big, popular series after everyone already knows about it. And its immesurably cooler reading it when its small and then later being able to say, told you so! This is exactly whats happening to this series right now, and its just making me so excited. So you could still be there for Book 3!

Both the reader and Susan are annoyed at the lack of ending. Before Susan can get to the author and get the remaining chapter, the author dies of an apparent suicide. Susan doesnt believe the death is a suicide and begins her own murder investigation. The reader is now pulled into 2 separate mystery stories.

32030,583,3924,"I love reading Lynsay Sands. Whether its her Paranormal, Contemporary or her Historical Romance series, I always feel fulfilled after reading one of her stories. I can continually count on her to write fun and interesting characters, to constantly bring a smile to my face and to always have a little bit of mystery to make everything interesting. Twice Bitten is exactly what I expected from her.

Wyatt was totally unexpected. A mortal who fell in love with El and then lost her when she just didn't show up. He was thoughtful, sexy and one of the most understanding men I have ever read. He knew what to say and when to say it and said it directly from his heart. There was nothing about this man that I didn't love  including his Gran.

El was, unfortunately, smothered by her mother. When she finally did get away from her, it was only for her to come to Canada from England and then take control of her life again. But, she finds out that pain can stop this overbearing, hurtful woman from entrancing her again. She finds a solution to this but gives Wyatt a heart-attack every time she does it. Then again, with someone trying to kill her, she is constantly in pain. When she finds out the extent to which her mother took her suffocating ways, she has no choice but to confront her and put an end to her domineering mothering. Shell have Wyatt and the rest of the Argeneaus by her side and her sisters will have their freedom.

Lynsay Sands actually wrote a character that I hated. Martine was a bitch! She got under my skin, pissed me off and was just damn rotten. Understandably, she had her reasons, but she took being a doting mother just a little too far. It takes near death and threats for her to finally leave her children alone, return home and confess all to her husband. Then comes the weepies for me when El's father shows up and my heart just bursts.

Like I said in the beginning, Lynsay Sands just enthralls me. She writes stories that are so intriguing and has you turning page after page. She's fluent, fun and her writing is just plain wonderful. Again, she amazes me that she is still writing the Argeneau series and keeping it fresh and entertaining. I will be devastated if she ever decides to stop writing about this wonderful family.

32032,507,2769,"From the first pages of this immersive psychological thriller by newcomer AJ Finn, you're pulled into the claustrophobic world of Anna Fox, the storys first-person narrator. You don't see much of New York other than her townhouse, and by the end of the book, you may feel boxed in by its walls too.
Anna is not coping well after suffering some psychological trauma thats caused the breakup of her marriage, and you eventually learn the particulars. Though she talks to husband Ed and daughter Olivia by phone, they have moved out, leaving her rattling around her Harlem townhouse alone.
Before the family break-up, Anna worked as a child psychologist with children damaged by abuse, neglect, psychosis, modern life. Now shes the patient. She has developed a severe case of agoraphobia and does notcannotleave that house. Her psychiatrist and physical therapist come to her. Her groceries and drugs are delivered. She actually takes quite a few drugs, washing them down with astonishing quantities of red wine, delivered a case at a time, and lies about this dangerous practice to her doctor, husband Ed, and anyone else who asks.
To amuse herself, Anna watches old black and white movies and spies on the neighborhood, using the zoom lens of her cameramuch better than binoculars, she claims. Soon her own situation takes on the elements of the classic noir films Gaslight and Rear Window. Between the drugs and the merlot, you wonder whether Annas movie obsession is coloring her perceptions of real-life events.
Although Anna is obviously both disturbed and muddled, Finn has written her with compassion and truth. Her behavior is consistent with her character and disordered state of mind, and you believe in her actions, even the brave ones almost impossibly difficult for her.
Her new neighbors become aware of her spying and want her to stop. However, their teenage son befriends her. Hes a little lonely living in a new city and has other unremarkable teenage woes like the adolescents shed occasionally see in her clinical practice. To him, shes a refreshingly non-judgmental conversationalist. But when Anna sees the teenagers mother murdered and accuses the husband of killing her, the family tells the police shes delusional. Noticing the profusion of empty wine bottles, they doubt her too. I thought I saw where all this was headed, but Finn has several surprises in store.
Stories with unreliable narrators are a staple of the thriller genre. Sometimes the narrators know they're bending the truth to manipulate the people around them.

Retelling of Rear Window(1954) with James Stewart and Grace Kelly, minus the charm... this round the housebound main character is an unlikable female agoraphobic and former child psychologist who has given up on the outside world after a tragic event.  She drinks too much wine, is whacked on meds, possibly hallucinating, pushy AF, lurks a great deal on the Internet, and spends an obnoxious amount of time being a smack-worthy nosy neighbor via her windows... a seemingly unreliable narrator who may or may not have witnessed a murder by her neighbor across the way.

Kind of a despicable protagonist I never really took to.  Helpless and weak.  Her judgement is extremely poor--outright stupid-- and this made me wish she'd get institutionalized or that someone would just take her out.  Her ""Dr."" title was farcical.  Moreover, unlike Rear Window, no one here in this cast takes the place of Grace Kelly (who had more of a spine for a 1954 woman than the hot mess in this 21st century book)... just meh chemistry with Bina (a woman who shows up for exercise), neighbor Jane Russell, her tenant David, and Ethan, the teenage neighbor.  Grace Kelly's dynamic with the older Stewart as they chat and scheme and occasionally fool around was one of the best things about the movie.  This here is just some old movie fanboy fanfic. Though much like Rear Window... one does wonder why people don't close their dang blinds when they're up to no good!!!  Who is that dumb????  Implausible!!!  This book picks up the worst of Rear Window and ignores the best.  I just didn't care about any of these people.

I did like all the descriptive language and all the nods to old movies, though.  ""Jane Russell"" was a nice touch, ha ha.  Nothing particularly original here plot-wise but engaging enough plot (I didn't say characters) due to the competent writing.  It's a serviceable retelling that could make for a half decent new movie based on the old (author already has a movie deal)... but ultimately telling of Hollywood's inability to come up with new material.  Does it rate all the attention it's getting?  Nope. Just one of those new releases that goes viral but isn't really great or original... amazing how often this happens.  An okay read but definitely overhyped.  If you look at the author's rsum you'll see he's gotta have friends in high places... you do the math.",1522108800,3,25 star retel rear window1954 jame stewart grace kelli minu charm round housebound main charact unlik femal agoraphob former child psychologist given outsid world tragic event drink much wine whack med possibl hallucin pushi af lurk great deal internet spend obnoxi amount time smackworthi nosi neighbor via window seemingli unreli narrat may may wit murder neighbor across way kind despic protagonist never realli took helpless weak judgement extrem pooroutright stupid made wish shed get institution someon would take dr titl farcic moreov unlik rear window one cast take place grace kelli spine 1954 woman hot mess 21st centuri book meh chemistri bina woman show exercis neighbor jane russel tenant david ethan teenag neighbor grace kelli dynam older stewart chat scheme occasion fool around one best thing movi old movi fanboy fanfic though much like rear window one wonder peopl dont close dang blind theyr good dumb implaus book pick worst rear window ignor best didnt care peopl like descript languag nod old movi though jane russel nice touch ha ha noth
32034,2576,3647,"The Ian Rutledge series is Charles Todd's best, and this one was, once again, intelligently plotted. We see a little of Melinda Crawford, my favorite character after Rutledge. Frances, his sister, has just gotten married, and Inspector Rutledge is feeling a bit peripatetic. On a late-night drive, he comes upon a murdered man, and thus begins a complex, brilliantly plotted story. It seems as if Rutledge keeps searching, following leads, and nothing clicks until later in the book. The characters have gotten to asking him when he's going to find the murderer. And Hamish, the Scottish soldier whose ghost haunts him from the ""great war,"" is as usual helpful and always ready to offer a second opinion.

This mother and son writing team really struck gold with Inspector Rutledge, the stronger of their two series. I'm wondering if at some point they decide to marry off Rutledge; it would be fascinating to see how he deals with Hamish as a married man.

32036,2688,3925,"The Other Mother is an intense psychological thriller. Its confusing and disturbing, but fascinating. Nothing in this book is what it appears to be. There are many twists and surprises throughout the novel. All the pieces, though, do come together in the end.

Daphne Marist and Laurel Hobbs met in a support group for women suffering from intrusive thoughts and postpartum psychosis/depression. The two women became fast friends, confiding in one another their deepest thoughts and fears. Laurel encouraged Daphne to sharpen her appearance. Daphne readily agreed and changed her hairstyle, clothes, accessories, and behavior, to match her new, more confident friend, Laurel Hobbs. Their intense friendship, however, crumbled. Did their husbands sabotage it, or did they break it themselves?

 When Daphnes life began to spin out of control, she split from her husband and took infant Chloe with her. Daphne headed for the Catskills where a job awaited her. She started her new life under the assumed name, Laurel Hobbs. It was there, however, where Daphnes chaotic world turned into a never-ending nightmare. A world where layers of deceit and betrayals were exposed.

The Other Mother is a cleverly crafted thriller, where cunning characters come to life.  A word of caution to the reader, Postpartum Psychosis/Depression, Intrusive Thoughts, suicide and Borderline Personality, are addressed in this intriguing, dark novel.

32037,2147,3925,"In The Other Mother, Carol Goodman skillfully utilizes the unreliable narrator plot device which results in an engrossing, twist-filled mystery.

Daphne Marist and Laurel Hobbes meet at a support group meeting for new mothers who are struggling with postpartum disorders. Their daughters are both named Chloe and they strike up an unlikely friendship. Daphne is a former school librarian whose older husband manages a small hedge fund. Laurel is also married to a much older man but she is wealthy and attended exclusive schools in Europe. They quickly become inseparable and Laurel helps transform Daphne into her own image. Daphne eventually takes a job as an archivist for her favorite author Schuyler Sky Bennett and moves with Chloe to Skys estate in the Catskills which is next to the Crantham Psychiatric Center. Daphne becomes quite curious about former mental patient Edith Sharp and she finds herself in an shocking situation that she might not be able to escape.

Despite her sympathetic plight, Daphne is not an easy character to like at first. She is a bit of a doormat and does not really stand up for herself. Peter rules the roost and she easily gives in to him. She loves Chloe but she is overwhelmed by obsessive thoughts and fears. Her friendship with Laurel is not exactly healthy since, just like her marriage, Daphne follows wherever Laurel leads.

For the first half of the novel, Daphne is an incredibly unreliable narrator whose grasp on reality seems rather tenuous. She has trouble differentiating between fact and fantasy. She is also unsure whether her memories can be trusted.

Is Daphne just using Laurels identity to escape from Peter? Or does Daphne believe she is, in fact, Laurel? Well, that question is answered when her situation takes a shocking turn and Daphne finds herself in an increasingly precarious position. Will Daphne be able to convince anyone that she is telling the truth?

The Other Mother is an intriguing mystery where nothing or no one is quite as it first appears. Carol Goodman slowly parcels the truth through diary entries written by various characters. Although a couple of the plot twists are slightly implausible, the novel comes a stunning conclusion that is quite satisfying.

32039,741,3925,"The Other Mother by Carol Goodman is a highly recommended Gothic tale of motherhood and madness.

Daphne Marist meets her best friend, Laurel Hobbes, at a Westchester support group for new mothers with postpartum depression. The two women both have daughters named Chloe and both are married to controlling older men. They quickly become close friends and soon Daphne is going to Laurel's gym, visiting her hair stylist, and wearing similar clothes. While Laurel seems to suddenly be in a downward spiral, and her husband confides in Daphne that she is mentally ill, Daphne's husband, Peter, seems intent on still questioning her own mental stability and fitness as a parent.

Daphne takes her infant daughter, Chloe, and secretly leaves her husband and home. Assuming Laurel's identity and credentials, she accepts a job under Laurel's name as a live-in archivist for Schuyler Bennett, an author whose Catskills' mansion borders the grounds of a psychiatric institution where her father, Dr. Bennett, was once the director. Daphne tells no one her true identity and tries to involve herself in her job while piecing together what has been happening to her and uncovering secrets found in Bennett's papers.

The Other Mother is presented in three parts and includes excerpts from several different journals along with Daphne's first-person narrative. Daphne's thoughts clearly make her an unreliable narrator; you can't tell if she is having a mental break with reality or if there is some underhanded plot to make her think she is mentally ill and has lost touch with reality. Clearly, both husbands are controlling jerks, but is Daphne unwell?

Goodman presents a very twisty plot of domestic suspense brimming with unreliable narrators, tangled identities, and dark motives where secrets are slowly uncovered. Daphne's character is developed, but since she is also unreliable and suffering from postpartum OCD. She is full of doubt and confusion. The writing is quite good, but the big twist at the end left me shaking my head. And, no spoilers, but there is a certain point where I kept thinking a very simple blood test should have been done and would have answered a vital question. 3.5

32040,2200,3924,"Argeneau #27, What I love about this series is that they can be read as a stand alone. Even with as big as this family is and all the characters where it would be easy to get lost in all the characters Sands is really good about that in this one there were only four, five extra Argeneau couples, including my favorite couple Marguerite and Julius, as well as some family members who haven't found their life mates yet, and a couple of humans; despite the large cast of characters it's so easy to follow. The third person POV mainly follows Elspeth and some of Wyatt. This this still running parallel timeline wise with Immortal Nights and Immortal Unchained. Another thing I love about this series is the science behind their immortality and how they get all grumpy about being called vampires. Sands is such a talented writer for being able to continue on with this series without it getting boring, and refreshing past couples stories in the current book without over explaining or making it feel redundant.

After 140 years of being under her mother's over protective thumb Elspeth was finally able to escape and move out on her own. She been working with the Rogue Hunters helping them sort through their tip line. After checking out one of those calls and getting attacked my a unbalanced human Elspeth comes home to her quant little apartment to find not only her Mother but her twin sisters as well who've come for an unwelcome visit. In need of blood and rest Elspeth's Mom keeps trying to get Elspeth to take blood from the gorgeous landlady's grandson who just happened to be visiting also. Elspeth is able to resist her mother and she comes to realize being in pain helped to resist her mother. Wyatt was surprised to find Elspeth living in his grandmother's upstairs apartment and even more surprised to realize that she doesn't even remember him.

Wyatt knows something is up so he follows Elspeth, after Wyatt catches up Elspeth realizes Wyatt could be her life mate then she gets pushed in front of a car and Wyatt learns what she is and what he is to her. Attempts on her life keep happening and Wyatt is determined to keep her safe. With these coinciding with her Mother's appearance in town no one is for if it's her or someone else is behind the attacks. In one of the attempted attacks, donuts laced with cyanide, Wyatt almost dies and Elspeth brings him over. But it only gets worse before it gets better.

Overall, this was such a fun read, it brought back several women from the earlier books that I loved and the story was so good. Elspeth's dastardly mother and what she did was reprehensible at least her annoying sister were redeemable in the end. Wyatt and Elspeth were just wow, I loved them together.

32041,415,3924,"For over a century Elspeth Argeneau Pimm has been counting down the days until she could get away from her overly controlling mother and gain her independence. When that day comes and Elspeth moves to Canada to begin working with the Rogue Hunters, shes excited to be able to try things she never would have imagined under her mothers watch. Case-in-point, her landladys sexy grandson, Wyatt, just might prove to be exactly what Elspeth is looking for: no strings attached fun. Despite popular opinion, Elspeth isn't ready to settle down with a Life Mate  should she happen to meet hers.

Wyatt and Elspeth have actually met before; four years ago, and Wyatt immediately fell in love. He was hurt when Elspeth stood him up the day after their meeting, and hes kept looking for her ever since. Now, hes surprised to find out shes renting an apartment from his grandmother, and she has absolutely no recollection of Wyatt whatsoever. While hes trying to figure out what happened to Elspeths memories, a barrage of strange accidents keep befalling Elspeth, accidents that funnily enough would have killed a normal person, but as Wyatt quickly learns, theres more to Elspeth than meets the eye.

What I really enjoyed the most about Twice Bitten was seeing the family dynamic. Elspeths family is established. It is not new and just starting out. She and her siblings are grown (even if they are still considered young in Immortal years), and should be out on their own in the world. Yet tragedies in her mothers past prevents Elspeths mother from letting her children go. Its, at times, a toxic dynamic, but I think it speaks a lot about the burden that older Immortals carry. Those old enough to have seen the evils in the world repeatedly and how they're subsequently effected.

The problems with Elspeths apparent memory loss were subtle yet in the end turned out to deal with a bigger picture-type issue. I liked how Lynsay Sands tied it all together, however, I think we could have felt the impact of her memory loss more if we had more snippets of what happened on that day four years ago when she and Wyatt met. It was just a little short of satisfying for me in that regard.

Overall, Sands Argeneau series never fails to entertain. Ive enjoyed the break weve had from the previous story arc involving the missing Immortals where we get to see what else is happening concurrently with the hunt in Venezuela. Some not-so-veiled references have me wondering if were set to revisit that storyline in the next book.",1522108800,4,centuri elspeth argeneau pimm count day could get away overli control mother gain independ day come elspeth move canada begin work rogu hunter she excit abl tri thing never would imagin mother watch caseinpoint landladi sexi grandson wyatt might prove exactli elspeth look string attach fun despit popular opinion elspeth isnt readi settl life mate happen meet wyatt elspeth actual met four year ago wyatt immedi fell love hurt elspeth stood day meet he kept look ever sinc he surpris find she rent apart grandmoth absolut recollect wyatt whatsoev he tri figur happen elspeth memori barrag strang accid keep befal elspeth accid funnili enough would kill normal person wyatt quickli learn there elspeth meet eye realli enjoy twice bitten see famili dynam elspeth famili establish new start sibl grown even still consid young immort year world yet tragedi mother past prevent elspeth mother let child go time toxic dynam think speak lot burden older immort carri old enough seen evil world repeatedli

32044,2981,2763,"I loved the movie, so I decided to read the book. I didn't realize that it was written as a dry history book, when I bought it. I thought it would be written as a novel. I found the history of the times including racial relations, segregation, integration, the state of racism and misogyny, and the space race and development of aerospace engineering, as well as the details of these inspiring women's lives, to be very educational. I even highlighted passages to skim again in the future. However, I could only read a little at a time before getting kind of bored. Parts were a bit repetitive. A timeline would have been helpful, as the history covered several decades and various women's biographies from childhood through their careers at NACA and/or NASA.

The book also includes extensive footnotes, bibliography, and index. So, it would be a good resource for those who want to investigate further.

What is there left to say about this classic? This is my second read of this novel. First time I have read it in the early 90s. I think I liked it first time more than this time. I have decided to reread this to see what I think of it now and also because I want to watch the fantastic mini-series.

Unlike many other classics, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is easy to read. The old English language and terms are not too many here so it makes it a delightful reading. Characters are well written with each having its own identity. My favorite character in this novel remains Mrs. Bennet. I think she is very funny and hilarious not in an intended way.

Honestly what bothered me was this particular edition of the book. I bought it because the cover looked good but it is not a reader-friendly. It is more like a mass-market paperback which I really dislike. holding it and going through pages was not as comfortable as reading a hardcover book or a normal paperback one.",1522108800,4,rate 4050 left say classic second read novel first time read earli 90 think like first time time decid reread see think also want watch fantast miniseri unlik mani classic jane austen pride prejudic easi read old english languag term mani make delight read charact well written ident favorit charact novel remain mr bennet think funni hilari intend way honestli bother particular edit book bought cover look good readerfriendli like massmarket paperback realli dislik hold go page comfort read hardcov book normal paperback one

I liked Mari and Edgar well enough. Theyre both good people, smart, and they have excellent banter. The kids were pretty cute and I enjoyed their interactions with everyone. And Edgars sister India was probably the best part.

Plot wise, it was sort of meh. There are a lot of moving pieces and some of them didn't feel necessary. The very small bit of conflict was more of an annoyance and was resolved in a chapter. My main complaint is that I didn't see the chemistry outside of the banter. Were told that each one is attracted to the other, but it didn't actually translate for me.

Overall, it was a quick read with characters I liked. Im not sure if I would read the next one. Unless its India and a hate to love with her rival.

32049,513,3927,"Lenora Bells fabulous debut novel had cured my reading funk when it came out, and the extraordinary WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES outshines How the Duke Was Won on every level!

Mari Perkins had worked too hard to be instantaneously turned away from Mrs. Trilbys Agency for Superior Governesses. On her way to the agency, Maris possessions were stolen, and she needs a position; she has nothing left. Almost on her way out, Mari hears that the Duke of Banksfords new governess just quit, and Mari gets herself hired by the Duke. His nine year-old twins, Michel and Adele, are unmanageable, but nothing that Mari cant handle. Edgar Rochester, Duke of Banksford, is busy with his steam engines; he needs peace and quiet, but governesses are forever leaving, so he reluctantly agrees to a one-week trial for Mari. It doesnt take long before Edgar realises it had been a mistake to hire Miss Perkins 

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES has a bit of a Mary Poppins vibe, but its not all fluff and froth. I was invested in Mari and Edgars story from the start because of Ms. Bells outstanding writing, her scintillating dialogues, the compelling and clever premise, and her exceptional characterisations, and this is only the beginning. Mari is very engaging, confident in her abilities, and her love and respect for children are palpable, this is done so well, that in one instance, it brought tears to my eyes. I believe Lenora Bell has written my favourite children in a romance novel ever. Michel and Adele are intrinsic components of the story, and the link to much growth from several characters. In spite of appearing unbending and gruff, Edgars heart is in the right place, and his backstory is one of the best I have ever seen, and makes believable things that otherwise might have been less convincing. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES provides the undeniable proof that solid backstories make for a more solid foundation to build the narrative, and supply the environment needed for characters to build and move on. The characters are works of art: every single one well fleshed out.

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES unfolds at a brisk pace, and the prose is witty, sparkling, luminous; the writing is positively marvellous! Ms. Bells meticulous research shines through delightful period details about steam engines, fire brigades, child rearing, toys, books, which only serve to further enhance the genuineness of the story.

The romance isn't rushed; it builds slowly through trust, communication, respect, kindness, and Edgar is exactly the sort of hero I love reading about, and I wish there were more of his kind in romanceland. Mari is also on a personal quest, which concludes in a charming and whimsical manner; and Edgars relentless pursuit on improving fire engines contributes to the fabulous conclusion as well. There is no useless detail to this story, neither is there a single superfluous word, nor the slightest little lull. I cannot fail to mention the splendiferous India, Edgars sister, who captured my imagination like few characters do, and I am beyond thrilled that her story will be next; this is a book that will not release quickly enough! WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DUKE MAKES has one of the most satisfying HEA ever; it is perfectly enchanting!

I liked Ember and Ranger. They have a great history and I loved their wordless conversations and the spark they had between them. They complimented each other well. There are loads and loads and LOADS of other characters and I pretty much gave up trying to keep track of them.

Plot wise it was sort of lack luster. I did like the game with Dawn, but it just seemed like so much work when a conversation could have worked. Actually, the majority of this story is conflict due to lack of communication and thats where I started to get bored. There was a lot to unpack here and not all of it felt necessary.

Her romance with Gabe Hunter, tattoo shop owner and longtime family friend is a slow burn one that comes to fruition in some steamy scenes. Keeping their affair a secret is necessary at first but of course all secrets have a way of coming out.

32057,603,3926,"Hurts to Love You by Alisha Rai is book Three in The Forbidden Hearts series. This is the story of Evangeline Chandler and Gabriel Hunter. I have read the previous book but feel this is easily a standalone book.
Eve is the younger sister who has stayed in the shadows but she always seem to have a crush on Gabe her brother's friend. But even though he has made a name for himself as more than just the housekeeper's son she didn't try to be anything more. Gabe too has liked Eve but always thought she was to young and and he is never let him mind forget he was the housekeepers son.

32058,57,3926,"The youngest in a power family, Eve has felt more comfortable hidden away in her shell. However, when a chance to make a move on a long standing crush arises, she begins to realize that being herself and letting others see her is the only way to get what she truly wants.
Growing up the housekeeper's kid kept Gabe slightly on the outside looking in. Getting close to people has always been difficult but when he gets some alone time with Eve, the girl he's tried to stay away from because of her age, he begins to realize that she's a woman now and getting close to someone can be the best thing in the world.

Imperfections were what made a piece unique. Impossible to replicate.

Book three and the last in the Forbidden Hearts series, gives us Eve and Gabe's story. Eve is Nicholas' (Hate to Want You) younger sister and has made appearances as the bullied by her father, overprotected by her brother, standing up for her brother, and crushing on Gabe, shy girl. Here we get the full depth and breadth of her character. The author does an amazing job showing the growth Eve goes through as the story progresses. She goes from hiding her wants and desires to allowing herself to express them and making no apologies for them. Eve's personal growth kind of dominated the story for me as her character was so well thought out and written.

She was Eve. A Chandler. And he had far too many problems to get tangled up in a Chandler.

Gabe has also made appearances in the last two books, as Livvy's (Hate to Want You) boss and Jackson's (Wrong to Need You) too talkative want to be friend. He's been the genial, nice, and open guy who is big in stature with a heart of gold. Here we learn about a deeply held secret and the hidden pain this has caused him. I had a harder time connecting with Gabe as the story seemed to not have quite enough room for his character to breathe on the pages. The secret takes a while to get revealed and as a consequence, his closed off persona and constant pushing and running away from Eve was lacking context and his commitment issues began to get tiresome.

Can I have you? he murmured.

The basis and continuing thread of this series has been the family drama between the Chandlers and the Oka-Kanes, this book is no exception. It stole some time away from Eve and Gabe; this crosses the line into feeling more like an encompassing series wrap-up than Eve and Gabe's story more than once. From the glimpses we got from them in the series I was, personally, hoping for more of a spotlight on them. They have great chemistry but I would have liked more intimate scenes between them (a strong suite of this author) and just general more bonding interaction. Eve also does more of the heavy lifting as Gabe had a tendency to push her away; the lusting but ""oh no, I can't!"" rinse and repeat wore a bit thin. However, the glimpses we did get of Gabe's nice and sunny in the streets and hair pulling, dirty talking in the sheets will give you the thrills.

The hurt, pain, anger, and love this series has been full of and the amazing characters have made Alisha Rai a must read author here on out for me. She incorporates tough issues (depression, family dynamics), provides authentic joining and melding of people from all walks of life, writes brilliant women characters, and does it with such a beautiful ease, with added hot and sexy intimate scenes. Shy Eve and sweet Gabe get their happy ending, along with more Chandler and Oka-Kane revelations, heartache, and closure. Emotional ups and downs with hot sexy loving, read this series.

Here was love. Deep, unconditional love. And she deserved it.

I am a sucker for a smooth talking cowboy and I have to say Ranger definitely dazzled, he was charming and sweet when the moment called for it, and certainly knew his way to a woman's heart!

Ember and Ranger have been best friends forever and have been there for one another through thick and thin, illnesses and bad relationships. Ranger is an astronomer and up for a promotion at the observatory and needs a wife to help him advance his career. Ember feels she can use her matchmaking skills to help him find that special someone. What she doesn't realize is that Ranger has his sight on his best friend but doesn't know how to change that status. Through some bad matchmaking and miscommunications, Ranger finally gets Ember to realize she's the right one for him. In typical fashion the heroine has to come to this realization on her own and goes to great extent to win her man back. I truly love her writing because it is so descriptive and captures the essence of Ember and Ranger's friendship and how hard it is for them to switch gears without hurting the relationship. It's been a long time since my first kiss but she really captured what the feeling was like. Pure genius! Once again, Ms. Wilde delivers another great story in the Cupid, Texas series. Thank you!

32062,766,3926,"In this last installment of the Chandler/Kane saga, Evangaline Chandler, younger sister of Nicholas Chandler is crushing on Gabriel Hunter, tattoo artist and son of the Kane family housekeeper. There's a significant age difference between them, and since Gabe is also Nicholas' best friend, there's all the best-friend's-little-sister taboo thing going on. It isn't until they are forced to be together that the sparks have a chance to ignite.

Eve and Gabe's story takes place during Livvy and Nicholas's wedding week, a setting which provides for lots of family drama and revelations as one might expect, considering weddings typically bring out the best and worst in families! It was a good way to bring in the previous characters in the series, and I always enjoy that in a family based series. While Eve and Gabe have a few things to work first, their journey to happiness runs a gamut of emotions.

Hurts to Love You was true to it's title in that it was a very emotional story that demonstrates just how love can hurt too.

Not only were the characters and romance fantastic, it was an absolute hoot too boot. I can't count how many times while reading it that I cracked up laughing out loud.

I absolutely adored Elspeth's character. She's had to endure so much from her overbearing mother it was utterly insane. I wanted to reach through the pages and strangle that woman so many times, it's not funny. In fact it was impressive how humorous the book was in spite of how awful the mother was. So for Elspeth to have been such a strong character in the face of that opposition was nothing short of incredible, and I loved her all the more for it. And the hero, Wyatt? He was put through an incredible lot himself in a short time, but he took it all in stride. The two of them were very well paired.

32068,1934,3927,"What a difference a good book makes should be the subtitle of this book! Actually it was better than good, it was amazing. Can I just sing that? A MaaaZingg!

I absolutely love when a book makes me laugh. I can recall three separate times that I cracked up. I had to re-read it a few times until I got the giggles out. I just love connecting with a book like that.

As a retired preschool teacher I really related to the heroine, Mari with an iit rhymes with starry. I respected how she developed a trusting relationship with the heros children, Michel and Adele. For nine year old twins they were a handful. Mari demonstrated developmentally appropriate, hands-on, child process oriented art and engaged open-ended interaction. Its no wonder the children responded to her the way they did. She treated them with respect yet held them accountable for their actions. She set boundaries and expectations with appropriate consequences and was consistent and gave love with positive reinforcement. Yes, I noticed and applaud all that accurate child development detail in a romance book! If I was looking for a governess for my children then Id consider myself lucky to have her in my employment. Mari wasn't the only well-developed character is this story.

I had the opportunity to bond with the hero as well. Edgar Rochester, Duke of Banksford was a man in need of being rescued and it obviously had to be Mari or myself but unfortunately I cant be transported into the plot. Life is so unfair. At least I got to live it through Mari. Edgar was intelligent, kind and just made me smile. He was a tad stubborn but what hero isnt? Its part of their charm. It makes the reading much more pleasurable when they realize they are being stubborn and give in.

Who doesnt grow fond of children? Okay, not everyone, but I do. Michel and Adele were adorable. After all they went through, it was heartwarming to see them in a thriving home thanks to Mari, Edgar and his entire staff. I cant leave out Edgars sister, India when mentioning well developed characters. She was hilarious. I was happy to see that she is going to have a book of her own.

Of course there were a couple of characters that made me clench my fists such as Edgars mother and Mrs. Trilby. Ooooh, if I could get my hands on them. Id teach them a thing or two about being nice. However, youll have to read how they turned out.

The plot was brilliant and honestly, refreshing. It flowed smoothly with unexpected thread plots. There is more to this story than what the synopsis says. Theres a plot twist involving Mari that is quite captivating.

The writing style as well as the plot and cast of characters is really what made the book amazing. I thought it was a unique writing style to incorporate proverbs within Maris conversations. It was truly entertaining. I am compelled to share with other readers that this is the first time when Ive finished a novel that I Googled something that was mentioned in the story. I was intrigued with the plot regarding fire brigades and how they chose which fire to put out based on which insurance that property had. I didn't know about that history nor about the steam fire engine that was invented. If you don't know about both subjects then Id Google those two things prior to reading this book, but it certainly isn't necessary. The author did an exceptional job explaining it. I was more curious if it was factual.

The icing on the cake for me was the epilogue. I LOVED it. This was my first Lenora Bell novel and it won't be my last. Ill be looking for Indias story, For the Dukes Eyes Only coming out in October 2018! Until then I definitely recommend reading What a difference a Duke Makes! Its captivating, sexy and a heartstring tugger.

32069,741,3929,"Tangerine by Christine Mangan is a recommended historical fiction suspense novel set in Tangier, Morocco, in 1956.

Alice Shipley has moved to Tangier with her new husband, John McAllister, for his job. McAllister is an obnoxious, disagreeable man who married Alice for her money.  He loves Tangier and is always off doing something in the city, while Alice finds the city terrible and oppressive. She is not adjusting to life there at all. However, the last person she expected to show up in Tangier for a visit was Lucy Mason, whom she hasn't spoken to for over a year.

Alice and Lucy first met when they were freshman at Bennington in the early 1950s. The roommates became inseparable and were the best of friends - until an unnamed accident happened and the two did not part on good terms. Now, Lucy has traveled to Tangier specifically to see Alice. Alice is surprised to see her after whatever mysterious incident happened between the two. What is clear is that Lucy closely watches everything and always has, and that she is obsessed with Alice. The setting adds to the oppressive feeling, as Alice struggles with the heat and foreignness of Tangier.

The writing is wonderfully descriptive. The setting is meticulously detailed, creating an atmospheric setting. The story develops in chapters that alternate between the the two women's point of view, and describe events in the present and the past. It is the unnamed, mysterious accident/incident that happened between the two while they were in college, combined with Lucy's obsession with Alice that creates the feeling of tension. There is an almost Hitchcockian aura surrounding the plot and dialogue.

As I was reading Tangerine a feeling persisted that I had read this novel before, or had seen this film before - only the elusive-unnamed-original was better than this novel. The trouble is that the tension and drama is based on the big secret, which is so slow to be revealed that it actually offers no huge surprise. Astute readers will likely have felt the same as I did from the beginning and have an excellent idea where the plot is going long before it meanders that direction.  Additionally, even though the two women are described as being very different, sometimes it is hard to tell whose voice you are reading, which is disconcerting. What I do think is true is that this book will make a good movie - which is probably why the film rights have already been sold.

32070,2715,3929,"Tangerine is a well-paced, psychological thriller set in Tangier, Morocco that is told from two different perspectives. Alice, a wealthy, fragile, young woman with a history of tragedy and a husband and new home shes not entirely comfortable or content with. And Lucy, a dangerous, manipulative young lady who seems to lack a conscience and be driven by an unhealthy, violent obsession.

The writing is taut and vividly descriptive. The characters are complex, flawed, and highly unstable. And the plot, using alternating chapters, does a superb job of building tension and unease as it subtly unravels and intertwines an intricate web of lies, secrets, pretense, desperation, infatuation, violence, and murder.

Overall, Tangerine is a fantastic debut for Mangan that transports you to another time and place and reminds you that some friendships are not only toxic but often deadly.",1522108800,4,tangerin wellpac psycholog thriller set tangier morocco told two differ perspect alic wealthi fragil young woman histori tragedi husband new home she entir comfort content luci danger manipul young ladi seem lack conscienc driven unhealthi violent ob write taut vividli descript charact complex flaw highli unstabl plot use altern chapter superb job build tension uneas subtli unravel intertwin intric web lie secret pretens desper infatu violenc murder overal tangerin fantast debut mangan transport anoth time place remind friendship toxic often deadli

32072,783,3929,"From the publisher:  Its about Alice Shipley and Lucy Mason, at one time the closest of friends, now wedged apart by a chilling secret.  They find themselves reunited in Morocco in 1956, where revolution is imminent, though it seems like the real warfare is between the two of them.  The dusty alleyways of Tangier have never felt so ominous.

First things first:  Tangerine is what you are called if you are of, or from, Tangiers.  The chapters p.o.v. alternates between Lucy and Alice, fittingly enough. The first belongs to Alice, musing as she looks out the window at the streets of Morocco, thinking back to her days at Bennington College, in Vermont, where she and Lucy, both 17, were best friends and roommates [having met on their very first day at college.]  And where she met John McAllister, to whom she is now married, although having decided not to change her name:  It felt important, somehow, to retain some part of myself, my family, after everything that had happened.  Trying to not think each and every second of the day about what had happened in the cold, wintry Green Mountains of Vermont.  It is now just over a year since that time.  (There are several references to what had happened, although the reader is not told what that everything was for quite a while, e.g., It was perhaps too much to hope for, I knew, that things would simply revert back to how they had once been, before that terrible  night.)

Lucy, who is a writer of obituaries for a local newspaper, first appears in Chapter Two, as she describes the intense heat of the city, where she finds the promise of the unknown, of something infinitely deeper, richer, than anything I had ever experienced in the cold streets of New York.  She has come to Tangiers for the express purpose of finding and joining Alice.  Born in a small town in Vermont, Tangiers is literally another world for her.  When she makes her way to Alices apartment, she finds it cluttered with books, by Dickens and others of that ilk, which is surprising to Lucy, as the Alice she had known was not a big reader.  I had tried to encourage her during our four years as roommaes, but try as I might to interest her, she had only stuck up her nose.  Theyre all just so serious, she had complained . . . she was made, it seemed, for living, rather than reading about the experiences of other lives.  When Lucy re-enters her life, Alice is delighted to see her once friend, the closest friend that I had even known before it had all gone wrong.  The tale goes along this way, with fascinating insights into the two women, and into this stifling city, and its people and places, so completely foreign to everything they have known till then.  The writing is fascinating, and the mystery, when it is finally made clear to the reader, well worth the time it took to get us there.

32073,557,3731,"Jacqueline Winspear's father inspired her latest Maisie Dobbs novel, ""To Die But Once.""  The story opens in Hampshire, England, in 1940. British citizen are anxious about their sons who have already enlisted, and dread a possible invasion by the Germans.  The prologue focuses on fifteen-year-old Jimmy Coombes.  He and his fellow workers paint surfaces in airfields using a special flame retardant substance, but the emulsion induces terrible headaches. When Jimmy is found dead, Maisie Dobbs, a psychologist and investigator who is cool under pressure, reassuring, compassionate, and insightful, launches her own inquiry. She senses that the authorities are not inclined to dig deeply for answers.

Maisie has close friends, including her assistant, Billy Beale, and her best pal, Priscilla Partridge, who are both sick with worry, fearing that their children will come to harm while serving their country.  Having suffered grievous losses and trauma during and after the First World War, Maisie empathizes with anyone whose loved ones are at risk.  She has connections with influential people, is unafraid to speak her mind (albeit tactfully), and perseveres when she believes she is on the right track.  With Billy's help and a great deal of effort on her part, Maisie discovers that certain individuals are up to no good, and unless someone stops her, she is determined to bring them to justice.

As she has so many times before, Winspear describes atmosphere, setting, character, and mood authentically and poignantly.  She also conveys the British citizenry's desperate hope that this conflict will not be as devastating as the previous one. ""To Die But Once"" is a solid work of historical fiction that captures the terror of adolescent boys forced to grow up too soon, and the foreboding that their families feel while awaiting word of their fate. The ending is a bit too tidy, and Maisie could use a romantic distraction, but ""To Die But Once"" is another worthy entry in this generally outstanding series.",1522108800,5,jacquelin winspear father inspir latest maisi dobb novel die stori open hampshir england 1940 british citizen anxiou son alreadi enlist dread possibl invas german prologu focus fifteenyearold jimmi coomb fellow worker paint surfac airfield use special flame retard substanc emuls induc terribl headach jimmi found dead maisi dobb psychologist investig cool pressur reassur compassion insight launch inquiri sen author inclin dig deepli answer maisi close friend includ assist billi beal best pal priscilla partridg sick worri fear child come harm serv countri suffer grievou loss trauma first world war maisi empath anyon whose love one risk connect influenti peopl unafraid speak mind albeit tact persever believ right track billi help great deal effort part maisi discov certain individu good unless someon stop determin bring justic mani time winspear describ atmospher set charact mood authent poignantli also convey british citizenri desper hope conflict devast previou one die solid work histor fiction captur terror adolesc boy forc grow soon forebod famili feel await word fate end bit

The Final Six is a Young Adult Science Fiction novel. There is a sequel planned.

The story is set in the future (the date is not specified). The basic premise is that the earth is in dire shape with floods and earthquakes. Twenty-four teens are being drafted to the International Space Training Camp. These teens will be competing to become one of six teens sent on a mission to Europa (Jupiters moon).

The narrators are teenagers Naomi and Leo (1st person POVs). Leo is from Italy and is an incredible swimmer. Naomi is from California and she is a science genius.

I really liked Naomi. She was a fantastic character. She was super close to her family. And I really liked how much she missed them. I also liked that she was kind and not out to sabotage other people.

I did like the competition. Although it sort of reminded me of another book, Dare Mighty Things by Heather Kaczynski.

Was there romance? Yes. It didn't overshadow the story IMO. But there was definitely a romance.

There were some unexpected twists at the end of the story that impressed me. I really was not expecting the book to end that way. I was a bit disappointed with how much of the story took place on earth vs outer space.

Overall, this was an interesting YA science fiction novel. I think that the ending was strong and the book left off in a very interesting place. I am interested to see what happens next in the sequel.

32078,1373,1324,"I read Their Eyes Were Watching God to fulfill the prompt of a book about feminism for the 2018 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge.

I picked up this book last year for a quarter at a library book sale, thinking I would get to it sooner than I did. Id heard good things about it, but really didn't know what to expect (I thought based on the title it would deal with religion a lot more than it did), so when I was browsing the prompts for this years reading challenge and saw this one listed as being a feminism title, I decided to tackle it.

The story begins with Janie returning home alone, which sets her neighbors tongues to wagging. Everyone wants to know why shes back, and why shes alone. Her best friend Pheoby brings her some food by, and Janie pours out her tale to her.

Written in the 1930s, the book is far ahead of its time, not just in the ideas and actions put forth by Janie as a woman, but as a Black woman. I really did enjoy her story, loved the paths her life took and how she stayed true to herself throughout, which didn't always sit well with others.

While this is a tale of feminism, its also a love story. Its about how sometimes you have to follow your own heart instead of the path others would have you follow. Its about life and how things don't always turn out as planned, or even how we ever imagined them being.

As I could see where the novel was going toward the last part, my heart broke a little, but Im glad I took the journey with Janie, and saw her through to the end.

The only issue I had with the book (and think some others might find difficult as well) is the dialect-heavy dialogue. It does give an authentic touch, and having grown up in the south, I could hear the accents of people Ive known delivering the lines, but there was just so much of it at times that it slowed the flow of the story. Aside from that, this was an excellent book.

32079,4828,1614,"With this novel, Peter Swanson proves that there are many talented contemporary crime fiction writers whose work can be compared with the classics of the genre, like Dashiell Hammet, Raymond Chandler, Patricia Highsmith and the others. In this case, Peter Swanson is inspired and influenced by Patricia Highsmith's crime writing tradition and the result is the best one could imagine, as ''The Kind Worth Killing'' contains all the positive elements of Highsmith's suspenseful prose without being a mere copy of the American crime fiction legend. The story is told by -many- different points of view, in the first-person narrative which gives the reader the opportunity to delve into the minds of, sometimes, disturbed characters and their cruel and evil thoughts that persecute them. The plot will definitely bring to mind the best of Highsmith novel(such as the ''Ripliad'' books or ''Strangers on a Train'') and as soon as the story begins to unfold, you will feel ''glued'' to your seat as well as being unable not to read one more chapter. It is the first, but certainly not the last, P. Swanson's book that I've read and I firmly believe that ''The Kind Worth Killing'' is a novel which will leave an exceptional lasting impression to its reader.

32080,1691,3927,"This is a fun, easy, unputdownable read. It's so enjoyable I finished it in only a couple of hours. The characters are engaging, from Edgar and Mari to India and Ravenwood, to the children, to the servants and tradesmen. There is an element of inside joke with the duke and governess pairing and I appreciate that being a long-time reader of historical romance.
Mari's comparison to Mary Poppins is apt because she is capable and amazing with the twins Michel and Adele. I love that she's bold and determined, she goes after what she wants.
I like Edgar and his struggle to not be like his father and fight his attraction for Mari. I love that he wants what's good for his children and he doesn't look down on his servants. I adore that he's a great brother and son, father and lover.
The secondary characters are wonderful, especially the twins, India, and Grafton. I'm glad Lenora held back on India because she is such a fascinating supporting cast member. I didn't feel as if she overshadowed the main characters, which is good because I'm looking forward to her book. Despite so many named people in the book, What a Difference a Duke Makes remained Edgar and Mari's book.
The story flowed smoothly and the pacing was just right.
If I have a minor complaint, it would be that Edgar and Mari are incredibly virtuous while the villains have no redeeming qualities. Also, that Mari may be a tad forward for a virgin and someone who was sequestered in a strict orphanage. Other than these, I really like this book.

32082,1942,3927,"London  -  Mrs. Trilbys Agency for Superior Governesses

Miss Mari Perkins has arrived a few minutes late for her appointment with Mrs. Trilby because she tried to help a lame girl across the road and some ruffians stole her trunk.  Mari has been promised a position as governess to Mr. Folsom who has 8 children, but the job has been given to someone else because she was late.  Mari was raised as an orphan in a charity school, but she is very well educated.  Even though Mrs. Trilby has told her to leave her office, she slips back inside just as another governess arrives to quit a difficult job.  When Mari overhears that the position the woman has left is with the Duke of Bansford of Grosvenor Square, she takes off to apply for the job herself.

Edgar, the Duke of Bansford and his sister, Lady India Rochester, are chatting when Mari arrives requesting to be considered for the position of governess.  Edgar had a liaison with a French woman who later gave birth to twins, Michel and Adele.  Edgar just found out about the 9-year-old children after the death of their mother.  He has had several governesses but the children have run them off.  Mari convinces him that she can do the job.

Soon, Mari enchants the children by taking them out and teaching them history first hand by visiting historical sites.  She also proves to them that they cannot scare her off with snakes and such which has terrified their other governesses.

Mari is a petite and pretty young woman and Edgar tries not to let himself be enticed by her.  However, she stands up to him and does not let him intimidate her which only intrigues him more.

When Mari had been left at the orphanage, a bible and a unique toy were left with her.  Mari wants to find out if these items could help her discover who her mother was.

I enjoyed this book and found Mari to be intelligent and in her element with children.  Edgar is OK but seems to lack self confidence.  Im sure this can be traced back to his childhood.  I think readers will be intrigued by Edgars sister, India, and I cant help but hope there might be a book in the works centered on her.  Be sure to read this book.  Its filled with lots of things that will keep you turning the pages.

It is a daunting task to review this book without giving anything away, but I shall try.

I was captured from the first page:
""My name is Amber Reynolds. There are three things you should know about me:
I'm in a coma.
My husband doesn't love me anymore.
Sometimes I lie.""

The story is given to us bit by bit in three ways, Then (before the incident that put Amber in a coma), Now (Amber's inner reactions to being in a coma), and entries from childhood diaries.

The author shows excellent skill in developing the main characters and giving the reader breadcrumbs of information bit by bit. You think you are piecing things together correctly and then WHAM!!!! Smacked upside the head and turned inside out. And not just once, but multiple times!

The two haven't spoken in over a year, but maybe becoming close with Lucy again is just what Alice needs to get back on track.

32097,567,3501,"I did enjoy JUDGMENT ROAD, but I wouldn't really call it paranormal romance.

I'm going to jump right into the characters. It takes a bit to really get to know Reaper, but I liked him. He has a really tough past that wasn't easy to read about. He is pretty deadly and comes across as heartless, but I felt for him and was really rooting for his HEA. Anya is on the run, but we don't really find out from what until way into the story. She is alone in the world and it was easy to connect to her feelings. She didn't trust easily and there were a few times that I wanted to shake her and say OPEN UP a little, but I totally got where she was coming from.

I enjoyed getting to know the secondary characters. They are ALL flawed and it will be interesting to watch them in future books. Having said that, I wasn't totally sold on the back stories of the motorcycle club. It is pretty out there and the facts are a little few and far between. I think maybe this might change as we get to know each member better.

The only paranormal thing happening in JUDGMENT ROAD is the fact that it's mentioned a few times that the members of Torpedo Ink motorcycle club have some talents. There isn't much use of these talents and their talents are an afterthought in the grand scheme of things. Maybe this will change in future  books, but as of right now, I don't really feel the paranormal coming through.

Now the romance definitely shines through and the sexy times can get pretty steamy. The relationship between Anya and Reaper is slow to form and has it's issues, but they fit together. When they both let the romance happen it is pure magic.

32099,1358,3930,"I received a free copy of this book to read and review for Wicked Reads.

This slow burn romance hits all the right notes. Vic and Rachel have danced around each other for a while now, but with her sister and his cousin becoming an item, it seems the time is right for Vic to make a move. Rachel is receptive and she can't help but notice all the things he does to make her feel safe.

The easy way they relate to each other makes this read all the more special.
