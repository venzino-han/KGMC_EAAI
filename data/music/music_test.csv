48313,147,2791,"Like all Bach Guild 'Big Box' collections, this is a terrific value - in this case, 14 hours and 6 minutes (according to my iTunes tracklist) and 184 tracks of music, 14 of Haydn's symphonies plus a good selection of his other works - string quartets, masses, divertimento. Haydn wrote so much music that it's not reasonable to expect anything close to 'completeness' in such a collection, but what is offered here is a very good sampling and a good starting point for anyone exploring Haydn for the first time.

The point of these collections, in my opinion, is not that the absolute qualify of the music is necessarily the best. Classical collectors and serious Mahler listeners will have other performances they prefer, and nobody is claiming that this set or similar sets are the top rated performances of this music.

I value these Bach Guild sets because of the value they represent, both for experienced collectors but especially for those who would like to dip their toes into classical music to see what it's all about. It is extraordinary, really, to be able to build a collection of fine music for such a reasonable price.

Then, after learning the music, becoming more familiar with it, there will be the natural desire to explore other performances. For those listeners, they can go further and obtain other downloads, or really 'splurge' and buy more 'normal' priced CD collections.

Regardless, this is a terrific value, and the performances are fully worth listening to.

It plumb eluded me for decades, having the single version on various artist records and CD's and recently replacing my few vinyl albums with the ESSENTIALS collection from Rhino, very well remastered.  But I still missed the long album version and finally, easy as pie!  Download the version digitally and you have a remastered terrific sounding copy to take you back to 1968!  Now I'm considering buying the rest of the album just for nostalgia, you can burn your own CD this way (I've done it with quite a few hard to find items now and Amazon gets total kudos from me in that department).  This song and this version is a national treasure of the psychedelic 60's and if you are only familiar with the single version from radio days, try this out, it's a buck and a quarter well spent.

48468,6754,1496,"Last month I found another classical music bargain at Amazon.com: Mozart: Complete String Quartets and Quintets on the VoxBox label. Featuring the Barchet Quartet, this is a very good MP3 album that contains over 10 hours of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts string quartets and quintets, all very artistically performed.

This MP3 VoxBox Edition contains all 23 of the string quartets in Mozarts oeuvre, plus all 6 of the string quintets he also composed. The works are placed in chronological order by their assigned K&ouml;chel (K) number, quartets first, followed by quintets. This allows listeners to hear the progression of Mozarts musical thinking and development over the years of composing in this genre.  Without question, each of these chamber works is a Mozartean masterpiece.

The Barchet Quartet was a German ensemble founded by violinist Reinhold Barchet. Other members of the ensemble were violinist Will Beh, violist Hermann Hirschfelder, and cellist Helmut Reimann. Violist Emil Kessinger joined the Barchets as a second viola for the string quintets. The musicianship of these players is generally excellent, although on occasion the violins sound a trifle over-bright, and display a bit more vibrato than my ears prefer. The audio quality is certainly crisp, clean, and precise, but the recordings thin string timbre and lack of fine detail make it obvious that these are older recordings that date from the 1950s and 1960s. However, this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.

When Mozart: The Complete String Quartets and Quintets first came out at Amazon.com in 2014, it apparently sold for 99 cents  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at nearly ten times that price ($9.49) I think it remains an excellent classical music value. With its low price, very fine performances, and good audio quality, it is certainly recommendable for any digital music library.",last month found anoth classic music bargain amazoncom mozart complet string quartet quintet voxbox label featur barchet quartet good mp3 album contain 10 hour wolfgang amadeu mozart string quartet quintet artist perform mp3 voxbox edit contain 23 string quartet mozart oeuvr plu 6 string quintet also compos work place chronolog order assign koumlchel k number quartet first follow quintet allow listen hear progress mozart music think develop year compos genr without question chamber work mozartean masterpiec barchet quartet german ensembl found violinist reinhold barchet member ensembl violinist beh violist hermann hirschfeld cellist helmut reimann violist emil kessing join barchet second viola string quintet musicianship player gener excel although occas violin sound trifl overbright display bit vibrato ear prefer audio qualiti certainli crisp clean precis record thin string timbr lack fine detail make obviou older record date 1950 1960 howev way detract overal listen pleasur mozart complet string quartet quintet first came amazoncom 2014 appar sold 99 cent extraordinari bargain even nearli ten time price 949 think remain excel classic music valu low price fine perform good audio qualiti certainli recommend digit music librari,1506643200,4

Now I'm not talking Fusion like in Jazz (which by definition IS fusion, like in Fused On) no, I'm talking Jazz Funk Rhythm & Blues Afro-Latin Gumbo Rock!  Dig That Fusion Baby!  Artists like Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations were producing progressive concept oriented albums that were catching the ears of listeners to the new progressive genres of Mahavishnu Orchestra, Santana, Traffic, Pink Floyd, Genesis, even Yes and ELP; and of course the progressive jazz of Creed Taylor's stable of jazz giants.  Earth Wind & Fire caught on quickly on campuses and their first two albums released on Warner Brothers' label (not represented here of course) got word of mouth disease, it was jazzy, funky, rock-drenched R&B and if you were an early acolyte to Chicago, this music was not a stretch at all, especially if you were also a fan of War, with or without Eric Burdon.

So this groovy 17-track single disc compendium of EARTH WIND & FIRE GREATEST HITS on the Columbia Legacy label is brilliantly engineered and sonically perfect for the fan who wants to light up their music collection with something essential.  The tracks are arranged in a rather organic order, not chronological but lending to a greater overarching feel of the evolution of their music.  Listen to Can't Hide Love and try not to think about ""smooth jazz"" a decade later, way ahead of its time, way!  This GH collection is pretty definitive and so well mastered it is the only 5 Star rated EWF album in the All Music Guide.  It contains all of The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire (1978) save the weakish Love Music, six of the 10 best from Best Of Volume 2, and has added the stupendous Kalimba Story (from Open Our Eyes, '74) and the title epic from Gratitude ('75).  Even if you have most of their studio releases, how can you live with yourself without the singles only September and Beatles cover Got To Get You Into My Life!

The CD comes with full music and track credits, a terrific bio (The Eternal Groove) by pop culture geek Mark Coleman and an intensely in-depth history (The Earth Wind & Fire Family Tree by Kevin Goins and Leo Sacks) all packaged with some beautiful artwork (always a staple of EWF albums).  Earth Wind & Fire were always a spiritually based group, full of positive vibrations and inner peace, Soul Food To Go as the Manhattan Transfer called it.

This song, although old, is still good and holds up without being too annoying even though it was a huge hit in the 90s. I just saw the video on MTV Classic and I just love her. She's so pretty in the video for this song. Natural beauty and talent. Like Mariah Carey (although I'm an even bigger fan of Mariah's). I wish Sheryl continued to make good music but these days I don't think that's really happening anymore although she had a new album earlier in April.

I miss her songs and wish dearly the quality of her tunes didn't peeter off. Sheryl is gold! One of my top 25 favorite artists probably. And that's saying something!

I like Simon & Garfunkel and saw the video on You Tube with over 1 million likes, so I thought I would add this song to my collection.

However after Holywood came out his albums became very hit or miss and dare I say boring. That changes with ""The Pale Emperor"" and he goes back to doing what he does best, making awesome music, that's extremely catchy. This album is a different beast from what has been released in the past, mainly due to the inclusion of more Blues Rock influences. It works really well and the entire album is easy to listen to from start to finish. Highlights for me include: ""Killing Strangers"", ""Deep Six"" and the great track ""Odds of Even"".",marilyn manson king shock rock 90 alway consist music howev holywood came album becam hit miss dare say bore chang pale emperor goe back best make awesom music that extrem catchi album differ beast releas past mainli due inclus blue rock influenc work realli well entir album easi listen start finish highlight includ kill stranger deep six great track odd even,1507852800,5

48830,6669,1476,"Now, this mp3 set of the complete harpsichord works of J.S.Bach doesn't actually have EVERYTHING, as his transcriptions of other composer's works are not included. Nor are any minor or perhaps spurious works. But pretty much everything else of consequence is included. It's a motherlode of music for the harpsichord by perhaps the greatest composer the instrument ever knew. Tons of great stuff, from the English and French Suites, to the Partitas and Toccatas, to both books of the Well-Tempered Clavier, to the Goldberg Variations and Inventions. My one quibble is that this music can get very repetitive very quickly. Of course, there is no way of playing dynamics on a harpsichord, so there is no real difference between soft and loud. Work after work can sound pretty much the same. Thank God Bach was such a stupendous genius!
  Martin Galling is a name that I'm not too familiar with, but he plays wonderfully, if a bit sewing-machine like at times. This is something the real Bach freaks will love. Moderate classical music listeners might like it too for it's immense size (over 15 hours says the label on the front). Glenn Gould fans should run away, run far away! But overall, I can't really say much more than: Recommended.---------------------------PEACE",mp3 set complet harpsichord work jsbach doesnt actual everyth transcript compos work includ minor perhap spuriou work pretti much everyth el consequ includ motherlod music harpsichord perhap greatest compos instrument ever knew ton great stuff english french suit partita toccata book welltemp clavier goldberg variat invent one quibbl music get repetit quickli cours way play dynam harpsichord real differ soft loud work work sound pretti much thank god bach stupend geniu martin gall name im familiar play wonder bit sewingmachin like time someth real bach freak love moder classic music listen might like immens size 15 hour say label front glenn gould fan run away run far away overal cant realli say much recommendedpeac,1508198400,4

But darn it, why couldn't they have given us an extra song or two? This is much too short. I still shudder at the thought of spending so much money for only 25 minutes of music. That makes this more an EP than a proper album. I shouldn't complain too loudly; the songs here are truly first-rate, but it's not exactly value for the money.

There isn't too many things I can remember when I was 7 years old but I still remember watching The Ed Sullivan Show way back one Sunday night in February of 1964 when the Beatles appeared causing a sensation bringing Beatlemania from England across the Atlantic to the U.S. Their music was like nothing ever heard before and would influence songwriters and musicians to this day.

Their songbook seems to be endless from all the great hits they had during their time together. To try to list all their greatest songs would take too much time and space for this review. For me though even more time consuming would be trying to pick which is my favorite song by the Fab Four. Just too many outstanding tunes to choose from. Most times you could say my favorite Beatles song is whichever one of theirs I happen to be listening to at that moment. If on the other hand you were to ask me to come up with a top ten list of the Beatles best songs there is one song in particular that would in my book make it somewhere on that list, the song is ""Rain"". A really great Beatles song that is while a great one is little known and overlooked by many fans.

One reason is it never charted. It also never appeared on any of the Beatles albums. In fact it was released in 1966 as the B side to the Beatles hit single ""Paperback Writer"". This is however I feel a song that deserved to be the A side on any single. It has everything a great song needs insightful lyrics, great beat, great guitar work that combined grabs your attention.  This was recorded at the time the Beatles were transitioning their sound from the mop top ""She loves you yeah yeah yeah"" kind of music to being more experimental with their sound and creative with their words. For the true Beatles fanatic this is certainly one of their songs that has to be considered for download onto your iPod or smart phone.",die hard beatl fan forev isnt mani thing rememb 7 year old still rememb watch ed sullivan show way back one sunday night februari 1964 beatl appear caus sensat bring beatlemania england across atlant u music like noth ever heard would influenc songwrit musician day songbook seem endless great hit time togeth tri list greatest song would take much time space review though even time consum would tri pick favorit song fab four mani outstand tune choos time could say favorit beatl song whichev one happen listen moment hand ask come top ten list beatl best song one song particular would book make somewher list song rain realli great beatl song great one littl known overlook mani fan one reason never chart also never appear beatl album fact releas 1966 b side beatl hit singl paperback writer howev feel song deserv side singl everyth great song need insight lyric great beat great guitar work combin grab attent record,1508716800,5

They are returning to rock after a short jaunt into country that was not accepted.  They lost their name, and now they are trying to move into mainstream rock.  They have exceeded even some of their early albums that were hit oriented rather than quality.  Eventually this album will be recognized for the wonderful songs that never get old.  The band is recovering from the forces that would take them away from what they are good at, and I'm sure some of the band members also are questioning the direction they're going now.  Sometimes it's a step process, and this was a very good first step.  I've listened to these songs over and over, and only then do you appreciate the effort that went into making them.  Highly recommended for anyone who is coming to the 3 Doors the first time.",fan fickl expect super hit record good song throughout bad one return rock short jaunt countri accept lost name tri move mainstream rock exceed even earli album hit orient rather qualiti eventu album recogn wonder song never get old band recov forc would take away good im sure band member also question direct theyr go sometim step process good first step ive listen song appreci effort went make highli recommend anyon come 3 door first time,1508889600,5

49204,6949,3612,"It is astonishing to think that the Beatles recorded all the music on this 99:40 length double CD between late November 1966 and early April 1970, just a little over three years and four months.  As in the first compilation album, 1962-66, the listener can hear very clearly how their music evolves.  Short of having all the Beatles' albums from the period, 1967-70 is definitely the way to go, with music sampled from numerous singles, most of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR and SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, with three cuts from THE BEATLES (usually called ""the White Album""), four from ABBEY ROAD, and three from LET IT BE, all in chronological order.  Yes, there wasn't room for everything (I myself really miss ""Rocky Raccoon""), but it's a damn fine assortment nonetheless.  What's even more astonishing is that, even today, these songs don't sound a bit dated or quaint; the Beatles are just as rad as they ever were.

This is a great time to consolidate your old scratchy LP's from the Sixties, or to introduce a young friend to the glories of this group, which disbanded before any of them had turned 30.  Some trivia:  The Beatles: 1967-70 was released in the spring of 1973 and went straight to number one among albums.  The ""hairy Beatles"" photo on the cover was originally taken in 1969 and intended for a different album that didn't gel.  The ""Mop-Top Beatles"" photo on the cover of the 1962-66 compilation was taken in 1963, but not used as an album cover until that album was released ten years later.  It also appears on the inner gatefold here.

These series of concerts recorded from the early 80's through 2008, are an excellent document of a working band. Petty and The Heartbreakers are all in top form here.

I was at one of the shows that was included here (it was Tom Petty's week long residency at the Fillmore) and the atmosphere can positively be felt as the band's music rumbles throughout the speakers. The CDs are housed in cardboard sleeves with the songs listed on the back. All of these come in a nicely designed cardboard box and includes a booklet with comments from the late Petty about the concerts.

This is a nice summary of the band's live performances similar to Springsteen's boxed set released back in 1984 but, for me, this works so much better (and it is less expensive as well continuing to show Petty's commitment to not ripping off his fans).",im go miss tom petti melod honest direct intellig brand rock music seem fade away seri concert record earli 80 2008 excel document work band petti heartbreak top form one show includ tom petti week long resid fillmor atmospher posit felt band music rumbl throughout speaker cd hous cardboard sleev song list back come nice design cardboard box includ booklet comment late petti concert nice summari band live perform similar springsteen box set releas back 1984 work much better le expens well continu show petti commit rip fan,1510099200,5

Jeffrey Biegel, an American concert pianist, performs each of Mozarts piano sonatas with incomparable artistry. His interpretations of Mozarts music are simply exquisite in every way, and the audio quality of this MP3 album is among the best of any of the Big Box purchases I have made in the past few months.

Mozart: Big Piano Sonatas Box is a winner in every way. I think it ranks as one of the very best albums from The Bach Guild. At only 99 cents, this is an unbeatable bargain, and a must-own for anyone who enjoys the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

Of them all, however, I'd say ""Soak Up the Sun"" is my favorite.

Bassist Lee Dorman got half a duet with Ingle, but Bushy proved with his drum solo that you can get away with repeating ""Shave and a Haircut, Six Bits"" for a long time. As long as you dress it up with enough effects pedals. He got half a duet with Ingle too--a fantasia built on (would you believe) ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"".

It contains chamber music works from various composers of the romantic period of classical music, including: Antonin Dvorak, Anton Bruckner, Franz Schubert, Alexander Borodin, and Johannes Brahms.

Although I am somewhat less familiar with these composers chamber works than I am with those of J.S. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, I am very impressed with the selections that appear on this album. I think my favorite is Cypresses, a twelve-movement chamber work by Dvorak thats performed to perfection by The Cleveland Quartet. I also find the Violin Sonata in A Major and Piano Quintet in A Major by Schubert to be especially enjoyable.

As is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 1 is excellent. This album is a winner in every way, and at only 99 cents, its an unbeatable bargain that belongs in the digital music library of anyone who appreciates classical chamber music Highly recommended.",big chamber music box volum 1 first three chamber music big box mp3 album bach guild contain chamber music work variou compos romant period classic music includ antonin dvorak anton bruckner franz schubert alexand borodin johann brahm although somewhat le familiar compos chamber work j bach haydn mozart beethoven impress select appear album think favorit cypress twelvemov chamber work dvorak that perform perfect cleveland quartet also find violin sonata major piano quintet major schubert especi enjoy case everi big box mp3 album purchas thu far audio qualiti big chamber music box volum 1 excel album winner everi way 99 cent unbeat bargain belong digit music librari anyon appreci classic chamber music highli recommend,1510531200,5

But I loved this song the first time I heard it.

Tunes I got the most out of were the previously mentioned ass-kicking ""Lust For Life"", ""Sister Midnight"", ""Funtime"", the awesome ""Nightclubbing"", the very recognizable ""The Passenger"" and ""China Girl"". Not to mention some material off the newest CD - like ""Gardeia"", ""Chocolate Drops"" and ""Paraguay"". Only downside here - maybe for some - is that I didn't see any Stooges classics covered. That's okay - it's all good just the same. The DVD has the very same track listing as the two audio CD's.

49401,6754,5231,"Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 2"" is the second of three chamber music Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild. It contains chamber music works from various composers of the romantic period of classical music, including (among others): Ernst von Dohn&aacute;nyi, Claude Debussy, Darius Milhaud, Alban Berg, Maurice Ravel, and Charles Gounod.

Although I am somewhat less familiar with these composers chamber works than I am with those of J.S. Bach, Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, I am very impressed with the selections that appear on this album. I think my favorites are Milhauds Petite Symphony No. 3 as performed by the Sinfonia Orchestra with Barry Faldner, and Dohn&aacute;nyis Piano Quintet No. 1 in C minor by The Cleveland Quartet with Barry Snyder. I also find the Debussys Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp to be especially enjoyable.

As is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 2 is excellent. This album is a clear winner, and at only 99 cents, its an unbeatable bargain.

49413,6669,5733,"Many people thought that Bob Dylan's album Christmas in the Heart must have been some kind of sick holiday joke back in 2009, but I think it has held up well in the years since. This is one of the more offbeat, but finest holiday albums released in the past 20 to 25 years. And as the years (and Christmases) go by, it seems more and more that this is the Christmas seed from which all of Dylan's recent ""great American songbook"" albums have sprung from. This album was meant to echo the classic, old-time Xmas songs of way back when. Like Sinatra, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, Burl Ives and company. The arrangements and production values reflect that. Yes, Bob's voice is ragged, creakly, sandpapery and rough, but you get a feeling that he puts new life into these songs which can seem tired at best in the hands of another singer. And you feel that he truly believes the sentiments expressed in these songs, something very rare in today's Xmas albums. Another trick of the trade that Bob (and perhaps everybody) knows: just like the late great Leonard Cohen, Bob uses sweet female voices to be the sugar on his sometimes hard to get vocals. The backup singers here remind me of the Andrews Sisters. The point is that this album works.
  Highlights include Here Comes Santa Claus, I'll Be Home for Christmas, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, The Christmas Song and more. I'd never heard the song Christmas Island before, but now I have to rank it among my favorite Xmas songs. It's cute and kitschy. This album is recommended for Dylan fans, Xmas album nuts, and those who grow a bit tired of the holiday fare on Lite FM. It's also a wonderful primer for those who wish to get into (or try to appreciate) Dylan's more recent standards albums, Shadows in the Night, Fallen Angels and Triplicate. All in all a nice recommendation. Happy (very early) Holidays!------------------------------PEACE

49422,15,2193,"It is always sad whenever someone young and talented dies at a early age. For this, it was a deviating shocker. Hearing about the tragic death of Malcolm Young, one of the musical virtuosos of AC/DC, was just a devastating shock. Hard to believe he passed away after leaving the group 3 years ago, and privately battling with dementia that crippled him. Now with his death, he joins his musical brother Bon Scott, who died over 35 years ago, after he had long-fronted the group. But with Brian Johnson taking the helm, AC/DC hit their commercial peak with Back In Black. Through that album, AC/DC had a lot of great songs through that album. But nevertheless, the group had a lot of wonderful anthems, and You Shook Me All Night Long remains one of AC/DC's finest. The song is a real feel-good boogie rhythm that still ignites today from the heart and soul of the music. Whenever I hear this year, I think of all the joy AC/Dc brought to a mass appeal that no rock group had ever been able to do before. Now, with Malcolm Young passing on, his legacy is enshrined with some of guitar's greatest heroes like Jimi Hendrix and Chicago's Terry Kath and B.B. King. May Malcolm Young be forever remembered, shaking us all night long.

It contains chamber music works from various composers of the classical and early romantic periods of classical music, including (among others): Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Giacchino Rossini, and Luigi Boccherini.

I am much more familiar with most of these composers chamber works than I am with those featured on Big Chamber Music Box Volumes 1 and 2  (both of which I have reviewed here at Amazon.com).  My expectations for the music on this third volume were therefore very high, and I am pleased to report that the music in no way disappointed. Indeed, I am very favorably impressed with both the selections that appear on this album, and the quality of the performances. My favorites include Haydns Quartet for Guitar and Strings in D major; Beethovens Duo for Clarinet and Bassoon in C major; and, of course, Mozarts incomparable Serenade for Winds in B flat major Gran Partita.  I also find Boccherinis Quintet for Guitar and Strings in E major to be especially enjoyable.

As is the case with every Big Box MP3 album I have purchased thus far, the audio quality of Big Chamber Music Box, Volume 3 is excellent.

49475,15,2618,"Utmost, it is honestly very sad whenever someone who has a gift, throws it away and passes on. That is sadly the case with David Cassidy. After all of the stardom and success in The Partridge Family, he passed away from a broken heart, after his years of battling drug and alcohol addiction, bankruptcy and numerous failed marriages with failing as a father to his children. It is no surprise to me, just like other child stars whom had died early with their deep wounds like Dana Plato & Gary Coleman from Different Strokes that also died from the same, damaged heart. One song that I will always remember of David's from The Partridge Family is really his signature track from the show, I Think I Love You. The song really is a trip back in time to when music and harmony was innocent in the 70's, with so much strife in the world and the beginning off the peace movements of the generation. David really was a blessing at the end, but could have been more if he was on the right path, and not with one that had so much wounds at the end. He will be missed at the innocence that David was.

49641,2173,1377,"Five MARVELOUS Stars. From the album The Best of Spanky & Our Gang, 20th Century Masters, The Millennium Collection, this is the short-lived, so-called sunshine pop vocal and instrumental group, Spanky & Our Gang performing their lovely, swinging performance of their classic hit song, Like To Get To Know You that continues to get lots of airplay by the oldies but goodies radio stations. The group was led by Elaine Spanky McFarlane whose sultry, attractive, distinctive voice gave the group its unique vocal sound. The Our Gang septet members were: Malcolm Hale, Nigel Pickering, Paul Oz Bach, John Seiter, Kenny Hodges, and Lefty Baker, all on vocals, plus Max Bennett on bass, Larry Knechtel on piano, Mike Deasy on guitar, and Hal Blaine on drums, and an 11 piece string section. Unfortunately, arranger/guitarist Malcolm Hale died in an accident and the group chose to not go on without him in 1969. But their marvelous music, which transcends musical genres, has been re-packaged several time in re-issues and is thankfully available in the digital MP3 era. This one song alone shows they were already talented artists who could mix genres in creating highly-attractive vocal and instrumentally rhythmic music

The song Like To Get To Know You was written by producer Stuart Scharf and is about the search for love. Arranger Hale creates a marvelous shifting musical setting combining rock, latin, jazz, and classical musical devices. It is actually built on a subtle latin beat and uses an advanced musical pedal point that can be repeated endlessly if desired: a form that jazz men Ahmad Jamal, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane used to great advantage as modal music. Legendary drummer Blaine, the most recorded drummer in recording history, whips up a subtle storm behind the group throughout the performance.

The song Like To Get To Know You is a favorite that is begins with an attractive buoyant drum beat, violins, and a comping piano over drum rimshots. The song is build on the infectious repetition of call-response lyrics like Id like to get to know you', (""yes I would""): ""Id like to get to know you"", (""if I could) and so on. The male members and Spanky trade lyrics until Spanky enters alone on the bridge with a sassy delivery which continues on with the main lyric and the refrain. Then suddenly comes a lovely, idyllic interlude with ethereal echoes, strings, and guitars which sets the stage for a pretty vocal coda that includes the male voices and Spankys voice in another call-response phase that vamps to the fadeout. Produced by Stuart Scharf. What a marvelous performance and a feat of studio engineering! My Highest Recommendation. Five APPEALING Stars. (Island Mercury records. 1-MP3 track.

I enjoy every song, even ""Rococo"" (strange lyrics but awesome music). Win Butler has a great voice, it's full of emotion and melody. How can you not feel something on tracks like: ""Modern Man"", ""We Used to Wait, ""Deep Blue,"", ""Ready to Start"", and the title track? The answer is, you can't. He has this special, rare quality to his music that you can't fake or manufacture. Beautiful album by a beautiful band. ""The Suburbs"" is a meaningful and unforgettable album. I listen to it all the time. And I don't care what people say, I also like their latest album, ""Everything Now"". I appreciate that the band are not afraid to change up their sound with each studio album. So with that being said, I recommend ALL 5 of their studio albums, but start with ""The Suburbs"" - it's their most groundbreaking.

I love Two Steps from Hell, and Thomas Bergersen's previous album ""Illusions"" was magnificent (10 stars for that one).  This one sounded better in the 30-sec previews; I found it has a very tribal quality (due to the vocals) upon listening to the tracks all the way through.  It's in my writing playlist rotation, as I don't think it's a bad album...it's just not quite what I was expecting.  Still, it's grown on me the more I've listened to it - one of those cases of familiarity breeding enjoyment.  I don't regret my purchase; this is one I might have delayed, however, if I'd had the forethought to listen to it on YouTube.  While ""Illusions"" remains a masterful work with infinite replay value, ""Sun"" is more a mood thing and one I don't find myself reaching to play as often.",425 star album ye im get nitpicki love two step hell thoma bergersen previou album illus magnific 10 star one one sound better 30sec preview found tribal qualiti due vocal upon listen track way write playlist rotat dont think bad albumit quit expect still grown ive listen one case familiar breed enjoy dont regret purchas one might delay howev id forethought listen youtub illus remain master work infinit replay valu sun mood thing one dont find reach play often,1513382400,4

50032,15,5921,"Hard to believe that today marks the 2nd anniversary since the tragic death of Natalie Cole. Musically, she was one of the most soulful R&B songstresses in the world. Yet, in the way Natalie was remembered at the end, was actually by so many people remembering Natalie from the problems she had endeavored back in the 70's and early 80's, from bankruptcy and addiction. Sadly, that is disgusting to her legacy, and the everlasting memory of her beloved father, Nat King Cole. There are so many songs she had soulfully graced our hearts with for 40 years of pop music. Natalie Cole will always be remembered so many great songs, but her debut hit, Everlasting Love, will always be the one people will go to for the first glimpse. The song is just a joyous and soulful rhythm that still shows beauty and soul from the heart. today, the song has been the signature opus, for eHarmony. It is one my favorite songs that Natalie Cole will forever be remembered for, and a real treat for anyone who has never even heard a glimpse of her unforgettable voice.

Let me just ask you, what music program of the modern era (right now) brings families together like this? This was way before MTV so we didn't suffer from lack of video of our favorite up and coming artists in those days, thanks to Glen's vision.

The beginning chords of 1st track & single ""REBEL HEART"" recall very early Beatles and the song also brings to (my) mind The Rembrandts Theme Song To (T.V. show) Friends, ""I'll Be There For You"", but more rock, less pop!  - Make no mistake, this is genuinely authentic ROCK!! The guitars on ""Never Look Behind Ya"" recall a more recent band, The Black Keys.  The opening chords on ""Liar"" are reminiscent of Cream's ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", but then takes off in its' own really rockin' direction!!  Biggest rocker on CD & my #1 favorite!!  Some songs, though relatively few, considering...have a faint whisper of Tom Petty (particularly Track #2 ""Birdwatching"" & Track #9, ""Gold""), but no influences heard here will hit you over the head; it's much more subtle - more like a light flavoring, rather than a dollop of gravy!!

All tracks Winners, no Fillers!  Additional noteworthy favorites including ""Birdwatching"" & ""Liar"" are all 4 opening tracks wherein Track #1 is the phenomenal ""Rebel Heart"" & Track #9 ""Fortune Teller!!

50305,15,2568,"It is honestly very sad whenever someone young and talented dies early. That has been the case already with the passing of their voice, Lemmy Kilmester, whom died back in late 2015 after having a sever battle with cancer. But that isn't alone just in regards to the passing of Lemmy. Sadly, the last surviving member of the original lineup of Motorhead has passed away. With the death of ""Fast"" Eddie Clark, it is a sad and heartbreaking reminder of what really great hard core rock music really was. Motorhead has had so many albums that drove in regards to Rock Music, but out of all of the songs and albums they have made in the world, Motorhead has had only one opus that really has withstood the test of time, with the release of Ace Of Spades. The song is just a fast and fierce anthem that really could rival with other 80's rock anthems like Pour Some Sugar On Me from Def Leppard & AC/DC's opus Back In Black. In any regards, if you have loved this song because of the legacy Motorhead had with Lemmy, you'll honor it for ""Fast"" Eddie Clark As Well.

50380,3458,5759,"In the first few minutes of this guided hypnosis program you are told:
Rumination is related to chronic anxiety and depression.
If you are already dealing with rumination your natural tendency is to escalate things. Hearing that over-thinking may be part of two worse issues; namely anxiety and depression, doesnt seem particularly helpful or mollifying, to me.
I also found his talking speed abnormally slow. As someone who has been trained in clinical hypnosis as part of my post graduate studies, I found it too slow. I started feeling tense waiting for his next words.
Still, some of the messages are very helpful, which is why I gave it three stars.
Also, some people might find the slightly droning background music calming...to each his own.
These guided meditation/hypnosis programs really come down to individual preference. You have to try them before you can know if they're helpful to you, or not.
I highly recommend the free mediations on the app called INSIGHT TIMER. Its truly incredible, and I have no vested interest...just a happy user of the service.

50401,15,2752,"It is honestly a heartbreaking moment, whenever somebody talented & gifted dies with a broken heart. When I had heard about the devastating death of Dolores O' Riordan, whom had fronted the cranberries throughout the 90's, I was shocked. It is so sad that she would die in the same way that we had lost George Michael a little over a year ago. She had a unique gift, but sadly, she let it go to waste, just as much with the same demons that plagued other divas whom had died young like Amy Winehouse and Whitney Houston. When I do think of their music, I think of it as a ladies' alternative to the success that U2 had garnered throughout the decades in hard rock. There have been some of The Cranberries songs that still do stand out today, but Linger was the first hit that still remains as stark and haunting, as the day it had came out. It truly is a song worth noticing from the soul, especially if you have never heard a Cranberries song before. This is the song that I sincerely recommend that you do go to first, as a everlasting memory to Dolores.

50682,1545,596,"For a long time the only song I regularly listened to by Toto was ""Rosanna.""  What can I say -- you tend to stick to the music you grew up with.  But after hearing from multiple sources that ""Africa"" was one of their best, I decided to give it a listen.  Turns out I'd heard it before, I just hadn't known the title or connected it to Toto at all.  And while I still prefer ""Rosanna"" over ""Africa,"" ""Africa"" is still a very enjoyable song, and makes me want to check out more by the band.

""Africa"" is a nice upbeat song, a well-done mix of pop and rock with a tune that's pleasant to listen to and good vocal harmonies.  The lyrics are somewhat generic -- despite the occasional Africa references (such as Kilimanjaro), it seems more like a generic love song than anything else.  Still, as another well-known band likes to say, ""some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs, and what's wrong with that?""

A pleasant song, and a good listen for anyone who enjoys Toto or '80s music in general.  Pairs nicely with ""Rosanna"" or anything by Starship or Journey.",long time song regularli listen toto rosanna say tend stick music grew hear multipl sourc africa one best decid give listen turn id heard hadnt known titl connect toto still prefer rosanna africa africa still enjoy song make want check band africa nice upbeat song welldon mix pop rock tune that pleasant listen good vocal harmoni lyric somewhat gener despit occasion africa refer kilimanjaro seem like gener love song anyth el still anoth wellknown band like say peopl wanna fill world silli love song what wrong pleasant song good listen anyon enjoy toto 80 music gener pair nice rosanna anyth starship journey,1517788800,4

50882,1788,2775,"Over four albums, Grace Potter & the Nocturnals have passed from their folk-rock beginnings to Potter wielding her open-E-tuned Gibson Flying V through stadium-stompers rockers like Paris (Ooh La La) and The Lion the Beast the Beat.  Midnight continues this trend with Hot to the Touch, Alive Tonight, and the rebel-yell Instigators.  However, rumors are that Potter fired The Nocturnals halfway through the album, relying much more heavily on collaborative writing with producer Eric Valentine  who also played nearly all the instruments on Midnight.  This insular approach resulted in quite a number of tracks that don't sound as fully developed as they might have been with input from a fully experienced band.  The drum-machined Delirious sounds like a Gloria Estefan knockoff.  The melody of The Miner bears more than a passing resemblance to Paul McCartneys My Love.  And Your Girl is Prince without the prance.  Lyrically, nothing on Midnight carries the soulful fire of Potters biggest ballad Stars, from her previous album The Lion the Beast the Beat.  If Nobodys Born with a Broken Heart is supposed to be poetically profound, Potters romance with Valentine has clearly weakened her critical judgment as a writer.  And while Potter remains in fine voice, the diminished influence of The Nocturnals leaves Midnight a mixed bag of tricks.",four album grace potter nocturn pas folkrock begin potter wield openetun gibson fli v stadiumstomp rocker like pari ooh la la lion beast beat midnight continu trend hot touch aliv tonight rebelyel instig howev rumor potter fire nocturn halfway album reli much heavili collabor write produc eric valentin also play nearli instrument midnight insular approach result quit number track dont sound fulli develop might input fulli experienc band drummachin deliri sound like gloria estefan knockoff melodi miner bear pas resembl paul mccartney love girl princ without pranc lyric noth midnight carri soul fire potter biggest ballad star previou album lion beast beat nobodi born broken heart suppos poetic profound potter romanc valentin clearli weaken critic judgment writer potter remain fine voic diminish influenc nocturn leav midnight mix bag trick,1518998400,3

51003,2962,5890,"I am going to admit that the only reason I picked this up is because I came across I Surrender on YouTube and was moved to worship and tears.  I wanted that song in my collection and hoped that I would find more of the same.  Well, I both did and didnt.  I did because there is a bounty of worship none of which I was familiar with but I didn't because I didn't find any other song that generated the same type of emotional or worshipful connection that I Surrender did.  Im not terribly into worship music and don't like a lot of it so when I find something that I resonate so strongly with I end up having high hopes.  I wasn't disappointed but sometimes I found myself having to work at being engaged.  I do think that the albums last two tracks, Greater Than All with its crescendoing force and a studio version of Hope of the World with an upfront piano line and steady rhythm, are very good worship songs.  Vocalists vary and include both men and women leads.  There are some other tracks on here that are moving or that I just enjoy (the production is such that the live experience is muted and it really sounds more like a studio album with background shouts and choral voices and echoes tracked down) and I was surprised at how long Hillsong has been doing this and it being commercially available.  Personally I don't know that I will go out and purchase another Hillsong Live disc but at least they're on my radar.",go admit reason pick came across surrend youtub move worship tear want song collect hope would find well didnt bounti worship none familiar didnt didnt find song gener type emot worship connect surrend im terribl worship music dont like lot find someth reson strongli end high hope wasnt disappoint sometim found work engag think album last two track greater crescendo forc studio version hope world upfront piano line steadi rhythm good worship song vocalist vari includ men woman lead track move enjoy product live experi mute realli sound like studio album background shout choral voic echo track surpris long hillsong commerci avail person dont know go purchas anoth hillsong live disc least theyr radar,1519430400,4

Tom Petty and the Hearbreakers are on top of there game throughout these shows, recorded at various venues over many years. Whether it's original material or a tasty cover tune, Petty shows why fans loved him so much, performing every song with unbridled energy, passion, and emotional depth. Whether it's a rocker or a mid-tempo song Petty and the band know the way to your heart.

Another one of the (many) joys in listening to this set are the spontaneous audience participation bits. Mutual love. Mutual respect. Petty was simply one of the VERY best in the business. His studio albums were almost all great ones, but I think he especially thrived in a live setting. Listen to this and savor every song.

Not that that's a bad thing.  If anything, ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" (the song) was a mainstay of my childhood, a nostalgic hit that reminds me of a less complicated time of my life and brings back fond memories.  And while the song is ostensibly about a couple on the verge of breaking up and struggling to find something in common (with both of them liking the titular film being the only common ground they seem to have), the song itself is surprisingly upbeat and warm.

I may not know anything else Deep Blue Something has released, and I still need to watch ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" (the movie) at some point in my life.  But in the meantime, this song still evokes strong memories of my childhood and early teens, and for that I love it.",vein might fillintheblank list everywher there one might 90 kid associ breakfast tiffani song instead truman capot novel audrey hepburn film base that bad thing anyth breakfast tiffani song mainstay childhood nostalg hit remind le complic time life bring back fond memori song ostens coupl verg break struggl find someth common like titular film common ground seem song surprisingli upbeat warm may know anyth el deep blue someth releas still need watch breakfast tiffani movi point life meantim song still evok strong memori childhood earli teen love,1521417600,5

My only disappointment is there isn't ""more where that came from"" I would love more and more of this. Alina Baraz has a voice that makes you pay attention and absorb every word, every note until it becomes part of you. Complemented perfectly by the talent of Galimatias that makes the beauty of her voice a hauntingly addictive sound that will have you returning over and over for a taste.

He has had so many highs  and achievements that no singer will ever replicate & lows that could've derailed his life & career. But through it all, his legacy will always be beyond the yellow brick road. He has had so many bountiful generations come to him, and why he is still standing strong, where others like Michael Jackson & Prince died so young. You can listen to any of Elton's songs, and they still sound better than what is on radio right now. But nevertheless, the one album many people will always go to is his 1973 double-album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, which bridged so many divides in the music industry. The title track, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is just very timeless to listen to, produced by the dear Gus Dudgeon, as a timeless portrait of what a musician's soul is like when he finally meets his future and runs with it for a new light at the end of the tunnel. If you are new to Elton John's music, after all these generations or a very dear hard core fan, you'll absolutely want to go to this track as one of the first to listen to.

51881,5268,1975,"Future world music hasn't let me down quite yet, except for the 2 songs in this album I'm not a fan of, which I just hit the next button and all is well.  The 2 songs here are ""Stages of Life"" and ""Follow You or Follow Me"".  For some odd reason I can't listen to ""Stages of Life"", simply can't get through it.  Also, the song ""Follow You or Follow Me"", is the only song I've ever heard from FWM that has actual lyrics, not sure if the artist was experimenting with lyrics, but I never really cared for lyrics, which is why i got in to trailer music.  This album is still absolutely worth the purchase for 1 song alone [and the rest of the other songs], the song ""Crossroads"", a song that was WAY to short.  The first part is the usual and amazing FWM sound, and the second part is an absolutely amazing piano solo up there with the best piano I've heard that if the rest of the music didn't take you mind on a musical adventure, it's that song that will.  I pull the 750Hz, the 1.5KHz, and the 2.2KHz bands up on my equalizer and tweeters make that piano just glow with superb depth.",futur world music hasnt let quit yet except 2 song album im fan hit next button well 2 song stage life follow follow odd reason cant listen stage life simpli cant get also song follow follow song ive ever heard fwm actual lyric sure artist experi lyric never realli care lyric got trailer music album still absolut worth purchas 1 song alon rest song song crossroad song way short first part usual amaz fwm sound second part absolut amaz piano solo best piano ive heard rest music didnt take mind music adventur song pull 750hz 15khz 22khz band equal tweeter make piano glow superb depth,1522627200,5

Even when I'm not driving, this music takes my mind on an adventure, I feel as though I'm in an alternate reality where life seems worth living.
A few of the songs in this album feel a little short, wishing they were longer.",trucker album plu rest futur world music make job seem much intens becom huge fan trailer music fwm instrument core realli slow motion twelv titan music expand artist collect even im drive music take mind adventur feel though im altern realiti life seem worth live song album feel littl short wish longer,1522627200,5

52373,1388,2287,"Count me among the many who were sufficiently dismayed at My Morning Jackets strangely simultaneous evolution from dreamweavers to self-imitators around the exact time Evil Urges arrived on the grating screech of overreach. I kind of had a falling out with the band then, made a little bit of an effort to get into Circuital, but I had resigned myself to never hearing much of the soaring, celestial mystery you hear in classics past. Its cool for a band to evolve, sometimes you just evolve in a different direction than they do. No biggie.

The Waterfall is more of a continuation of my glancing interest in what they're up to, combined with a fatalistic pessimism that weve seen the very best they can do so far.  There are some tracks here, however, that are not only among their very best, but take the bus in a strange new direction that was unforeseen, intriguing, and rather dark in a good way. The first order of business is to get past the first two tracks, which are embarrassingly bad and borderline rival even the most cheeseball moments of Evil Urges.  Believe has absolutely nothing to say and nowhere to go, and Compound Fracture wallows in genericness, a real stinker.  But from there on out, prepare to get your wig blown back by a band on a mission, with the next two tracks being back to back classics, incorporating a wide-eyed, almost childlike wonderment, flirting with the listener, an exhausting journey that reaffirms they are capable of still producing some astounding music. Putting the hypnotic qualities of repetition to use on Like the Rivers middle section and The Waterfalls insistent vocal hook, you honestly don't want those two songs to end. Spring finally does something mysterious and uncharacteristic with Jim James obsession with dance rock, and Thin Line and Tropics throttle way up on a soulful groove that feels startling, uncomfortable, real.

52650,3366,3782,"I'm an old school metal fan that's new to Stryper.  I got pulled in after listening to their newest album, God Damn Evil, and all I can say about Fallen is...WOW!!!  What a great album!  Talk about addictive!  I can listen to this album over and over from start to finish.  Like I said, I'm new to Stryper, so older fans of the band might not see it the same way, but Yahweh is one of the most original sounding, amazing songs that I've ever heard.  The church-like ""Yahweh"" at the beginning followed by an incredible riff and then it just gets better from there.  I can't get that song out of my head.  My kids are getting tired of me singing it around the house (probably due to my ""singing"" more than anything).  But after that song, there are so many other great songs on here, such as Sorry, Lost, Big Screen Lies, King of Kings...you name it, they're all good.  Stryper isn't as heavy as many of the groups I listen to (Megadeth, Slayer, Kreator, C.O.C...to name but a few), but they more than make up for it in song craft and melody, not to mention an uplifting message (and some nice riffs to boot).  I really like this album and I'm finding myself really liking Stryper as well.  If you haven't listened to this yet...what are you waiting for?  Check it out!",im old school metal fan that new stryper got pull listen newest album god damn evil say fallen iswow great album talk addict listen album start finish like said im new stryper older fan band might see way yahweh one origin sound amaz song ive ever heard churchlik yahweh begin follow incred riff get better cant get song head kid get tire sing around hous probabl due sing anyth song mani great song sorri lost big screen lie king kingsyou name theyr good stryper isnt heavi mani group listen megadeth slayer kreator cocto name make song craft melodi mention uplift messag nice riff boot realli like album im find realli like stryper well havent listen yetwhat wait check,1525219200,5

Angel seems to be a spiritually healing music tune about meeting someone who has a blissful/joyful influence on ones life. The lyrics of you came when I wished for you within the song indicates meeting someone in your life who seems to be almost sent from heaven in ones life. The lyrics just now I realize within part of the song seems to me to be a positive dedication mini story about noticing after getting to know the person how they are an angel. Fortunately for me, I consider my husband of 14 years an angel in my life and I am frequently reminded from his positive example on  how to have both a forgiving heart and a modest spirit.

Of course this isn't going to be an album for everybody. Somebody is going to get their nose bent out of shape because their personal favorites aren't included and yes, a couple of these songs are not so good but that's to be expected from somebody with just the sheer bulk of songs Paul has recorded.

53167,523,1447,"In 1979, a double LP, simply crimson with gold leaf lettering SinatraJobim Sessions found its way into more than a few rock and jazz boomer collections.  Antonio Carlos Jobim had gone from Brazilian Bossa Nova legend to a big name regular in the Creed Taylor CTI Jazz stable.  I was one of those who picked it up even though Frank Sinatra was my Fathers music, he was still cool and probably more so in the 70s because he went from covering My Music (Heres to you Mrs. Robinson, ooby dooby doo) to doing some stand up appreciable real jazz and resembling the towering mighty man who fronted Harry James and Tony Dorseys orchestras and rose to superstardom in the 50s and made cool-jazz music with His Highness Basie.  The only way to lay your hands on this prize was as an import in places like Tower Records or if you knew of its existence you could have your mom and pop record store order it for you at a price.  Only Jobim fans and extremely serious Sinatra fans knew about it from articles.  The other way to get this material was to back order the old Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim (1967) and Sinatra & Company (1971) but you were still left without three of the tracks they did together: ""Bonita"", ""Sabi"", and ""Off Key (Desafinado)"".  The 10 track Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim, arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman, accompanied by a studio orchestra, is very nice but the real prize was the eagerly sought other half of the Sessions arranged by Deodato (stable-mate of Jobim in CTI, and 2nd greatest Brazilian jazz man after Jobim alongside the Joo Gilberto family) and conducted by Morris Stoloff.  Of particular note: Francis Albert Sinatra & Antnio Carlos Jobim was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, but lost to the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Darn those Beatles!  Sinatra and Jobim worked together for a final time in 1994 on Duets II, recording a cover of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" if you want to be complete you will have to get that one too!

The original collection of Sinatra & Jobim tracks on their collaborations included two recordings which do not actually feature Jobim, ""Drinking Again"" and ""Manh De Carnaval.  SINATRA/JOBIM: THE COMPLETE REPRISE RECORDINGS does not include them, instead you get all 20 original recordings featuring both artists in their work of genius together.  As Amazon does not see fit to give you the track listings on the CD, here is the full lineup with credits:

1. The Girl from Ipanema (Antnio Carlos Jobim, Norman Gimbel, Vincius de Moraes)  3:20
2.  Dindi (Ray Gilbert, Jobim, Aloysio de Oliveria)  3:31

53170,3230,2839,"I happened upon The Fratellis late to the game!  But, ""better late than never!""  They're very talented & innovative, changing-it-up song by song (not only from one release to another) keeping your interest piqued!  I did go in reverse, getting ""In Your Own Sweet Time"" first (reviewed separately) & do like that one better, but I do like EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED!

Track #1 ""Me and the Devil"" and Track #3 ""Baby Don't You Lie to Me!"" have a similar sound & they're both highlights.  Track #6 ""Dogtown"" is a little weird.  It begins sounding a bit like a faster Beatles' ""Come Together"", but then goes into what reminds me of 'circus music' & both repeat through song.  That 'circus' music I find more than a little odd & for me the song would have been one of my favorites on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED without it - But, again, name of the game for The Fratellis seems to be experimentation & with that, some will work exremely well & some not at all.  And, they have many more in the ""works extremely well"" category!!  Track #2 ""Imposters"" (Little by Little) doesn't work for me, although it does showcase their variety, once more.  Guitar's much too ""twangy"" a.k.a. country-western for me.  Track #8 is a really pleasant, beautiful ballad & jumped into a favorite immediately, which is a complete surprise for me, since I don't usually care much for ballads & by 2018, that's a particularly nice revelation! On Track #9 ""Getting Surreal"" The Fratelli's pump it up a notch!

I didn't go with the deluxe version, because even on my most favorite recordings, I don't appreciate acoustic so much.  I imagine EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED is a must-have for Fratellis fans & I think it's an excellent jumping-in point for newcomers, as there's something enjoyable for everyone.  I would liken The Fratellis, especially on EYES WIDE, TONGUE TIED to a 21st Century Dire Straits, as they were uber-successful completely disregarding (1980's) trends & doing their own exceptionally talented thing.  The Fratellis don't sound like Dire Straits...the similarity lies in bucking trendy music, having a vast, devoted following & being hugely popular & successful!",happen upon fratelli late game better late never theyr talent innov changingitup song song one releas anoth keep interest piqu go revers get sweet time first review separ like one better like eye wide tongu tie track 1 devil track 3 babi dont lie similar sound theyr highlight track 6 dogtown littl weird begin sound bit like faster beatl come togeth goe remind circu music repeat song circu music find littl odd song would one favorit eye wide tongu tie without name game fratelli seem experiment work exrem well mani work extrem well categori track 2 impost littl littl doesnt work although showcas varieti guitar much twangi aka countrywestern track 8 realli pleasant beauti ballad jump favorit immedi complet surpris sinc dont usual care much ballad 2018 that particularli nice revel track 9 get surreal fratelli pump notch didnt go delux version even favorit record dont appreci acoust much imagin eye wide tongu tie musthav fratelli fan think excel jumpingin point newcom there someth enjoy everyon would liken,1527811200,3

A coworker kindly made a copy of the Linkin Park cd Meteora music collection from a computer and Somewhere I Belong happens to be one of my favorite songs from the Meteora collection even to this day. I rationally and intuitively understand that Somewhere I Belong is one of those songs that has a different meaning depending on who hears it andor who created it. However, I take Somewhere I Belong to be a constructive tune about simply wanting to feel andor be where spiritually, personally, andor psychologically belonging can happily occur (simply guessing from the lyrics I want to heal could imply various levels of healing-emotionally psychological spiritual etc.).",confess actual station north island california first heard emot sooth song somewher belong linkin park 2004 timefram cowork kindli made copi linkin park cd meteora music collect comput somewher belong happen one favorit song meteora collect even day ration intuit understand somewher belong one song differ mean depend hear andor creat howev take somewher belong construct tune simpli want feel andor spiritu person andor psycholog belong happili occur simpli guess lyric want heal could impli variou level healingemot psycholog spiritu etc,1528502400,5

53285,6751,5247,"The fact that Cyndi Lauper can make Country Music palatable to someone like me who doesnt normally listen to it is a testament to her likeability as a vocalist. There are some great tunes here and this collection plays better than the snooze fest that was found on the AT LAST CD.

FUNNEL OF LOVE has Cyndis trademark vocal tics and hiccups and they work wonderfully in this context.

DETOUR sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s by Kitty Wells.

MISTY BLUE is a dynamic vocal performance, period. This and HARD CANDY CHRISTMAS are probably the best ones on the CD.

WALKNG AFTER MIDNIGHT is one of the weak links only because no one can sing this like Patsy Cline and the arrangement isn't as atmospheric as the original; the lack of male backup is detrimental. I FALL TO PIECES works much better even though its a carbon-copy version of Patsys.

HEARTACHES BY THE NUMBER has a vocal that is typical Cyndi and an average arrangement.

END OF THE WORLD is less cringe-worthy than the syrupy Skeeter Davis version.

YOURE THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE UGLY with Vince Gill is a cute duet with lots of funny banter and it works better than the drowsy Willie Nelson duet on the country-blues number NIGHT LIFE.

I WANNA BE A COWBOYS SWEETHEART is noteworthy for the yodeling if nothing else.",fact cyndi lauper make countri music palat someon like doesnt normal listen testament likeabl vocalist great tune collect play better snooz fest found last cd funnel love cyndi trademark vocal tic hiccup work wonder context detour sound like record 1950 kitti well misti blue dynam vocal perform period hard candi christma probabl best one cd walkng midnight one weak link one sing like patsi cline arrang isnt atmospher origin lack male backup detriment fall piec work much better even though carboncopi version patsi heartach number vocal typic cyndi averag arrang end world le cringeworthi syrupi skeeter davi version your reason kid ugli vinc gill cute duet lot funni banter work better drowsi willi nelson duet countryblu number night life wanna cowboy sweetheart noteworthi yodel noth el,1528761600,4

53389,6669,1736,"I did not react too good to Bob Dylan as Sinatra-like crooner, although I gave it a shot as I like to think of myself as musically open minded. I've kind of worked backwards with his most recent trilogy, starting with Triplicate, and then moving on to Fallen Angels. Finally, I recently made it to the first album in the trilogy, Shadows in the Night. What at first seemed odd, out of place and wrong, now seems so perfectly right. I just didn't like Dylan in this guise because his voice it seems was always suited to raspy, bluesy, earthy rock numbers. His unique voice is perfect for that. But not for the Great American Songbook material he's been doing recently. I thought (perhaps mistakenly) that you needed a pure, beautiful, golden, old fashioned crooner voice to do this stuff justice. You know, Sinatra, Dino, Ella, Bing, Judy, and the Divine Sarah. Dylan's voice would seem out of place here, and he does sort of miss the notes in a way that sounds like someone who can barely sing. But I kind of knew that if I gave these recordings more time and listening space, I might be able to get them. And I was right, big time.
  Dylan uses his ragged and torn voice to not just caress these tunes, but inhabit them. Get into their very fiber and core. Find out what makes them tick, and then recreate them all over. And you can have the most ripped up voice in the world and still make these songs magnificent. It takes two things: genius and care. Bob certainly has the genius, and after good, hard listening you see he really cares about this music deeply. It's not a sort of ""Oh this worked great for Rod Stewart so I'll try it too"" thing. Rod has the fantastic voice but just doesn't seem to care much in the music. Dylan knocks it out of the park. I am constantly amazed when an album by Bob that I didn't seem to get and thought was subpar or terrible, turns out to be, after time and care, really good if not really great. Chalk Shadows in the Night up on that very long list.
  You don't see musicians like this come along every day, and Dylan's like won't be seen again for maybe a hundred years or more. If ever. So this is precious stuff. Pick it up and swim in it's melancholy. It's worth it.----------PEACE",react good bob dylan sinatralik crooner although gave shot like think music open mind ive kind work backward recent trilog start triplic move fallen angel final recent made first album trilog shadow night first seem odd place wrong seem perfectli right didnt like dylan gui voic seem alway suit raspi bluesi earthi rock number uniqu voic perfect great american songbook materi he recent thought perhap mistakenli need pure beauti golden old fashion crooner voic stuff justic know sinatra dino ella bing judi divin sarah dylan voic would seem place sort miss note way sound like someon bare sing kind knew gave record time listen space might abl get right big time dylan use rag torn voic caress tune inhabit get fiber core find make tick recreat rip voic world still make song magnific take two thing geniu care bob certainli geniu good hard listen see realli care music deepli sort oh work great rod stewart,1529884800,4

It seems just like yesterday that Radiohead released its latest (9th overall) album, but in fact it's been already over two years ago since the band unleashed ""A Moon Shaped Pool""onto the world. I have to admit, at first I wasn't really ""getting it"", but over time, this album has in turn released its inner beauty and I have been playing this album a LOT in the last couple of months, ahead of the band's return to Cincinnati (more on that later).

""A Moon Shaped Pool"" (11 tracks; 53 min.) opens with the urgent ""Burn The Witch"", which reminds me of the ""Hail to the Thief"" songs. It is followed by ""Daydreaming"", an introspective tune (and traditional concert opener on the current tour). We then get to ""Decks Dark"", which is my favorite track: I love the gradual build-up, and then the extra kick in the last 90 sec., just perfect, The album is now revved up and in full gear. Not that it means the songs are all loud or hard, far from it, but there is a cohesion to the soundscape as we go from track to track that just feels right. Among other highlights: ""Ful stop"" is mesmerizing, and ""The Numbers"" feels wistful. The album's closer is ""True Love Waits"", the song that has been around for 2 decades in one form or another. The live acoustic guitar version on 2001's ""I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings"" is a thing of beauty, but now comes this definitive version, featuring piano and keyboards, rather than acoustic guitar. What a great song.

I've seen Radiohead live a number of times over the years, and had the good fortune of seeing them in concert again this week here in Cincinnati. They played a 2 hr. 20 min. show that can only be described as magical. Playing from pretty much their entire catalog, the sold-out crowd ate it up from start to finish. The 4 songs from ""A Moon Shaped Pool"" blended in nicely. Check this out: Set List Cincinnati 7/25/18: 1. Daydreaming 2. Desert Island Disk 3. Ful Stop 4.2 + 2 = 5 5. Myxomatosis 6. Kid A 7.

53546,3230,3444,"I've had METRIC'S PAGANS IN VEGAS since its' release, so this review comes after some time.  I suppose I held off writing a review because I vacillate on how I feel.  I still don't feel it's in the same league as ""Synthetica"" (reviewed separately) & ""Fantasies"", which you know you love on first listen!  Other reviewers have noted PAGANS is more eletro/synth. than others, so perhaps that has something to do with it.  When I do go electronic, I still enjoy hearing guitar(s) too, especially a strong bass line and strong drums.

PAGAN'S opening track, ""Lie, Lie, Lie"" is a terrific one! which would be quite at home on either of the aforementioned METRIC CD/LP's.  Track #3 ""The Shade"" has that ethereal, haunting beauty and is quite good, as well as Track #7 ""Too Bad, So Sad"" which almost reaches a ""Youth Without Youth"" tone, while Track #5 ""Cascades"", another favorite, veers into an almost Depeche Mode/New Order sound.  Track #4 ""Celebrate"" isn't as likable, for me, having an EDM (electronic dance music) quality.  While I enjoy some EDM, I just feel METRIC defies genres, mixing & blending expertly to form their unique sound.

I agree that PAGANS IN VEGAS is definitely more of an electronic release.  Aside from some odd zappy eletro-synth. sounds on some tracks,  PAGANS IN VEGAS, while different from earlier releases, is a strong grower!!!  P.S. Upon some research, I've learned METRIC'S newest release is scheduled for late September!!!  Upon hearing first single ""Dark Saturday"" (fantastic!), if that's representative of the whole I'll be captivated with what may possibly be METRIC'S Finest!!
