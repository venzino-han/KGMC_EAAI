I would say this is equal to his first album Illusions. They are slightly different in sound and feel but are both excellent. This album feels like its telling a story and boy its an enjoyable, beautiful, and epic one.

42870,6439,1750,"Not to be Captain Obvious but this album does not represent what TSFH is famous for and is not their typical ""trailer music"". However, this album is very beautiful and adds to the eclectic music of TSFH. I want to point out that Thomas Bergersen composed this entire album but it was released as a TSFH album since many of these songs were released on previous industry albums. I would not recommend buying this if you are new to TSFH as it does not represent what they are most famous for. However, I would recommend buying this if you prefer softer pieces and songs that almost sound like pop music (I think Thomas created a new genre of music with this album - ""epic pop"", listen to ""My Freedom"" and you'll see what I mean), or if you have everything else from TSFH and want more. This is definitely a must if you are a diehard TSFH fan. If you are new to TSFH I would recommend Battlecry, Vanquish, Illusions, or Sun. The former two if you want epic courageous music, and the latter two if you primarily want epic emotional/beautiful music.

42875,6440,1193,"In ""X,"" Ed Sheeran's follow-up to his stunning debut ""+,"" he continues to dazzle with a wide variety of musical styles, all tied together with his trademark combination of rapid-fire rapping and mellow singing.  In the ""Wembley"" deluxe edition, listeners are treated to some extra studio tracks, including the dance-inspired collaboration with Rudimental ""Lay It All On Me,"" along with live recordings of ""Small Bump"" and ""The Parting Glass"" performed at Wembley.  The raw emotion of the live tracks contrasts with the slick studio sound of ""Lay It All on Me,"" which follows immediately afterwards, as well as some of gentler numbers such as the hit single ""Thinking Out Loud.""

In fact, contrast is the name of the game in ""X.""  Musical experimentation abounds: there's the aforementioned rap (""Don't,"" ""Take It Back,"" ""The Man""), rap-pop hybrids (""Nina,"" ""Touch and Go""), energetic and/or tortured guitar-pop (""I'm a Mess,"" ""Sing,"" ""Runaway""), some really schmalzy pop (this is where Sheeran tends to lose me, but I can recognize the talent even in ""Thinking Out Loud,"" which I find so sappy I can hardly bear to listen to it), and folk-, blues-, and bluegrass-inspired numbers.  This profusion of styles pretty much guarantees that any given listener is going to have strong favorite and non-favorites, but it also means there's something here to like for almost anyone, and no one is going to be bored.

As with the multifaceted musical sound, lyrically, the album does not at first glance tell one unified story or work as a single cycle; rather, multiple thought-strands and preoccupations come up again and again. The lyrical persona goes back and forth between outrage at romantic betrayal (""Don't,"" ""The Man""), regret at relationships that can't work (the outstanding ""Nina,"" ""Touch And Go,""), and the pink flush of love (""Thinking Out Loud,"" ""Tenerife Sea"").  In fact, though, there *is* a theme that pulls everything together: the singer's overwhelming drive to find success and his rock-hard self-belief, which tears apart his romantic life, threatens his family connections, and puts him at odds with his record company.  The ""Ed Sheeran"" (in quote marks because there's ""Ed Sheeran"" the lyrical persona, and Ed Sheeran the real person) of ""+"" was a young, naive, bleeding-heart kind of a guy; the ""Ed Sheeran"" of ""X"" is a little more cynical and a lot more concerned about the cost of the sudden success that's been thrust upon him.  ""X"" is in a certain respect the story of someone whose dreams have all come true: the question that follows is ""Now what?""  Does, the singer of ""X"" asks, success mean just an endless round of plane trips, punctuated by grim events like writing your will and arguing with your record company?  What kind of dreams do you have to give up to have all your dreams come true?

Which is not to say that the ""Ed Sheeran"" of ""X"" is gloomy and cast down.  On the contrary, he's full of energy and fight, ready to kick unfaithful lovers to the curb and spit braggadocio-filled lyrics about his talent and meteoric rise to the top of the charts.  Which, especially sandwiched between the softer songs, is charming.  But it does the beg the question (okay, it doesn't: the answer is staring us all in the face) of why Sheeran is treated so differently from his sometimes-collaborator and fellow pop prodigy Taylor Swift: the occasional critic might not be won over by Sheeran's message, but he seems to have escaped the criticism Swift experiences for using her personal life to fuel her music, for being calculated and driven, and (oh, the horror!) for not being ""inclusive"" enough in her feminism.  ""X"" is the album of a musician who unabashedly uses his personal life as artistic material, and openly wants to get ahead.  And the result is deservedly a smash hit.  But it's something that perhaps only Sheeran could get away with.",x ed sheeran followup stun debut continu dazzl wide varieti music style tie togeth trademark combin rapidfir rap mellow sing wembley delux edit listen treat extra studio track includ danceinspir collabor rudiment lay along live record small bump part glass perform wembley raw emot live track contrast slick studio sound lay follow immedi afterward well gentler number hit singl think loud fact contrast name game x music experiment abound there aforement rap dont take back man rappop hybrid nina touch go energet andor tortur guitarpop im mess sing runaway realli schmalzi pop sheeran tend lose recogn talent even think loud find sappi hardli bear listen folk blue bluegrassinspir number profus style pretti much guarante given listen go strong favorit nonfavorit also mean there someth like almost anyon one go bore multifacet music sound lyric album first glanc tell one unifi stori work singl cycl rather multipl thoughtstrand preoccup come lyric persona goe back forth outrag romant betray dont man regret relationship cant work outstand nina touch go pink flush love think loud tenerif,1488067200,5

42883,2301,2968,"Rakaa Iriscience, Evidence, and DJ Babu of Dilated Peoples are back with another group LP after a long eight year hiatus since the 2006 release of their 20/20 album. In this considerable gap of time, the guys have kept busy doing various, individual side albums, collaborations, and other projects. Apparently the timeout must have inspired member appreciation of how valuable their combined chemistry really is because this 2014 Directors Of Photography album ranks equally with any one of their previous albums, which set a more ambitious standard for conscious hip hop with each consecutive release. The hallowed LA triumvirate are essentially back to their specialty, kicking tight, crafty hip hop rhymes and lyrics over elegant, soulful beats that are expertly put together, samples included. Fans can look forward to more life lessons on which to ponder and more unique attitudes, opinions, perspectives and philosophies to consider. In addition to the mental, metaphysical goodies on the album, Rakaa and Evidence also dabble in some tough-talk rapping, which means they believe in what they're saying, they are not speaking on some loose whim, and they can back up their words with strong reasoning. Every track on the album is a gem, but a few really stand out. ""Show Me The Way"" sounds like it could be a radio song. It's motivational, and it's got a great beat, a great hook, and great lyrics behind it. ""Figure It Out (Melvin's Theme)"" is notable for its screwed, scratched beat, which sounds like the old East Coast-influenced West meets DJ Screw's Houston, a great hip hop cut. The gang are not without worldly awareness in ""Century Of The Self"" where they analyze the corrupt, selfish tendencies of human nature on earth. The Dilated Peoples have always been proponents of building mentally and expanding minds. They have always come original and never copied trends or tried to be something other than themselves.

42898,15,4903,"It has been a rough past few years for Rihanna. Musically, she has had more hits outside of her own album, Anti this past year. Her work on songs like Sledgehammer and This Is What You Came For, continue to show that her own album success firmly is not what it used to be a decade, largely because she overexposed her own brand in the way that Beyonce' Knowles had done as well. The past few years showed Rihanna doing more singles that really were not a part of what became Anti, and bigger hits than what she released from Anti, with the exception of Work. Her latest single, Love On The Brain, the fourth from Anti, shows Rihanna is trying to be more of a swooner in the way other legendary divas had shown in classic R&B like the legendary Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin showcased. But Rihanna does not make the mark well, and sadly it is not the best on what she had n ballads for her songs. She showed it better when she teamed up with Ne-Yo on Hate That I Love You a decade ago. Perhaps when Rihanna does more ballads, she can swoon with a broader and more brilliant appeal than what she showed here.

42913,2301,2949,"The Watts, LA-raised, lyrical virtuoso Ras Kass, now over 18 years strong in the game, has banded with underground, boom-bap style producer Apollo Brown (Mello Music Group) for the Blasphemy LP. The Michigan-bred beat maker Brown has constructed a great set of productions that are just as complex and interesting as Ras Kass' lyrics are. As the title suggests, Blasphemy starts with Ras Kass making critical arguments against popular religions, especially Christianity, in ""How To Kill God."" He will continue in this questioning fashion for other tracks, like ""Deliver Us From Evil,"" where he discusses various historical violations of The Golden Rule. Although proclaiming himself a fallen angel, he boasts wisdom all over Blasphemy by preaching clean living (""Please Don't Let Me""), racial equality (""Strawberry"") and moral rules (""48 Laws Pt. 1""). As always though, Ras Kass still finds time to brag, strut and celebrate his gifts. His lyrical game is still sharp after all these years and so is his storytelling, as evidenced by ""Too Much Of A Good Thing"" and ""Francine,"" two songs about demons coming back to haunt mischievous women. Making the perfect beats to match the high caliber lyricism of Kass is no easy task. That's why Apollo Brown has combined eclectic samples, elegant instruments and East Coast style drum beats for a super nice audio event that can claim bits of orchestra, soul and r&b music within its mix.

Blasphemy contains three power-packed posse cuts, but with all the mighty guest verses on the album, they never seem to outshine Kass and his enormous lyrical prominence. Apollo Brown and Ras Kass are both respectful of the hip hop culture and the rap game, even if Kass is picking on industry giants one moment (""Humble Pi"") and saluting deceased legends the next (""Bon Voyage""). They make for a very compelling duo on the risky yet entertaining Blasphemy.",watt larais lyric virtuoso ra ka 18 year strong game band underground boombap style produc apollo brown mello music group blasphemi lp michiganbr beat maker brown construct great set product complex interest ra ka lyric titl suggest blasphemi start ra ka make critic argument popular religion especi christian kill god continu question fashion track like deliv u evil discus variou histor violat golden rule although proclaim fallen angel boast wisdom blasphemi preach clean live plea dont let racial equal strawberri moral rule 48 law pt 1 alway though ra ka still find time brag strut celebr gift lyric game still sharp year storytel evidenc much good thing francin two song demon come back haunt mischiev woman make perfect beat match high calib lyric ka easi task that apollo brown combin eclect sampl eleg instrument east coast style drum beat super nice audio event claim bit orchestra soul rb music within mix blasphemi contain three powerpack po cut mighti guest vers album never seem outshin ka enorm lyric promin apollo brown ra ka respect hip hop cultur rap game even ka pick industri giant one moment humbl pi salut deceas legend next bon voyag make,1488153600,3

42916,2301,2977,"Maryland, let alone its Gaithersburg township, may not be a natural breeding ground for rap talent, but 2013 XXL Freshman, Logic, may soon be putting his locale on the map. The rapper and part time producer, who has been buzzing since his mixtape cascade began in 2010, seems to have his mind in the right place for Under Pressure, his studio debut. Executive produced by No ID and released by Def Jam and Visionary Music Group, Under Pressure boasts busy, luscious beats and a matured Logic confronting his rough past with a bright outlook on life. Logic starts the album with this positive tone and then delves into family stories and gets ambitious in the ""Soul Food"" two-parter. He covers a variety of topics throughout (girls, crime, movies, crew love, karma, etc.), but the most prominent and reoccurring of them include Logic's transition from a troubled, aimless childhood to mind- blowing music stardom and how it affects him and his family. Under Pressure's production as a whole captures several emotions and vibes, and it definitely has No ID's ambient beat making influence. A diverse array of producers including Visionary's 6ix and Logic himself supply rich electronic instruments and quick repeating hoots on more than one song. Logic proves himself a flavorful emcee, rapping at different speeds and cadences with a varying rhyme structure and awesome energy. He demonstrates multiple dimensions of creativity on tracks like ""Nikki,"" about a specific type of chemical dependency, and the title track ""Under Pressure,"" where he raps in the first person as his sister then father. The regular version of the album contains no guests but features Childish Gambino and Big Sean on two deluxe version bonus cuts. In the 12th track, ""Till The End,"" Logic recaps his rocky experiences in the music business and life in general but stays committed to keeping an optimistic attitude going forward. It is a fitting close to the album, where Logic shares his feelings and conveys again his project's chief mood.

He has worked with many figures in the biz from Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Ice Cube to his frequently recurring collaborators, AMG, 2nd II None, Hi-C, El DeBarge, Suga Free, and Playa Hamm, some of whom appear on Quik's ninth solo album, The Midnight Life. Quik of course infuses his signature funk and soul into the album but puts a different twist on them just for this collection of songs. Cool, original guitar, piano, and horns with strong drums and claps are layered upon each other for a rich, voluptuous audio experience from start to finish. Quik has added some talk boxing, an unusual instrument (by hip hop standards) in the second track, and a jaw dropping concept beat in ""Trapped On The Tracks."" His lyrics are again stimulating and diverse with rhymes, and in addition to the familiar guests are some new ones, Bishop Lamont, David Blake II, and Dom Kennedy. Quik runs the gamut of speaking topics from personal philosophy to natural social phenomena, but his main aim is to have a great time in the musical process. Amongst his various talking points, he hits upon the mark he has made on the game, the beauty of living fly, his seniority in hip hop, just deserts for promiscuous women, and relationship communication. DJ Quik has such appealing, easily identifiable style and flavor that are unique enough so as to require little maintenance over time except for the necessary experimentation for freshness and modern day relevancy. He has put all those things in The Midnight Life, so the new dawn for the Compton raised, music virtuoso looks very bright.",music artist reliabl consist put excel album one hip hop compton california instrumentalist produc disc jockey rapper dj quik one continu except artist legendari coast hip hop whole produc rap sinc eighti play instrument sinc child quik david blake assembl gorgeou funk soul beat time alway interest emce mic work mani figur biz tupac dr dre ice cube frequent recur collabor amg 2nd ii none hic el debarg suga free playa hamm appear quik ninth solo album midnight life quik cours infus signatur funk soul album put differ twist collect song cool origin guitar piano horn strong drum clap layer upon rich voluptu audio experi start finish quik ad talk box unusu instrument hip hop standard second track jaw drop concept beat trap track lyric stimul diver rhyme addit familiar guest new one bishop lamont david blake ii dom kennedi quik run gamut speak topic person philosophi natur social phenomenon main aim great time music process amongst variou talk point hit upon mark made game beauti live fli senior hip hop desert promiscu woman,1488153600,4

42925,2301,1263,"Aesop Rock, the man with the largest vocabulary in hip hop (or so states New York data scientist Matt Daniels), has returned with emcee Rob Sonic and DJ Big Wiz (who combined make up the group Hail Mary Mallon) for Bestiary, the trio's second LP. Released by Rhymesayers Entertainment, the same label that released HHM's first LP, Are You Gonna Eat That?, Bestiary contains a more digestible form of its fore- album's bizarre, complex lyricism of wacky, oddball imagery and situations. Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic are unruly, aimless badasses, rapping all over the place and in all directions. With their ill rhyme styles, they explore the nature and philosophy of life and death, and their wild, artful rapping accurately mimics the chaos of the world. Taking its name from the word meaning a written account of real and fantasy animals, Bestiary contains some animal imagery but just lots of other imagery too, like art gallery-scale imagery. Despite all the craziness and a few dark undertones, there is a sense of purpose, hope and levity in Bestiary thanks to the ""fund raiser concert"" skits and their do-it-yourself subtext. Coupled with the intelligent, left field lyrics, the samples, scratches, diverse synths and hard rocking drums make Bestiary a truly eccentric specimen of underground, alternative hip hop. It marks a new level of comfort for Hail Mary Mallon that just might prove comforting to audiences as well.",aesop rock man largest vocabulari hip hop state new york data scientist matt daniel return emce rob sonic dj big wiz combin make group hail mari mallon bestiari trio second lp releas rhymesay entertain label releas hhm first lp gonna eat bestiari contain digest form fore album bizarr complex lyric wacki oddbal imageri situat aesop rock rob sonic unruli aimless badass rap place direct ill rhyme style explor natur philosophi life death wild art rap accur mimic chao world take name word mean written account real fantasi anim bestiari contain anim imageri lot imageri like art galleryscal imageri despit crazi dark underton sen purpos hope leviti bestiari thank fund raiser concert skit doityourself subtext coupl intellig left field lyric sampl scratch diver synth hard rock drum make bestiari truli eccentr specimen underground altern hip hop mark new level comfort hail mari mallon might prove comfort audienc well,1488153600,3

Most of the other reviews give you a good gist of what this band sounds like. You can hear plenty of Velvet Underground influence, a bit of Pavement, and I also hear a healthy dose of old Dream Syndicate in some songs. Obviously, those are some very good influences. But Parquet Courts also have this maddening tendency to talk-rap in some of the songs, as if they are just too lazy to actually sing the song. The lead singer has a decent enough voice, so I don't know why they do this so often. Other than those infrequent musical hiccups, there are some powerful, riveting songs on this latest effort.

42937,2301,1111,"Alternative, conscious hip hop can be approached from many angles, which is why it's glaring when styles are reused without expounding on, extrapolating from or offering solutions to the source issues. In the Words Paint Pictures EP, Rapper Big Pooh (of Durham, North Carolina trio Little Brother fame) and Detroit producer Apollo Brown have come together with the spirit of Mello Music Group to once again describe what they feel are the most exigent problems in society now, namely police-on-black violence, federal government wrongdoing and the prison industrial complex as a second ghetto for blacks.

All of those moving parts, which blossom from Pooh's golden rapping voice box, play out to the backdrop of Brown's sample-based soul beats, which are nice as always but show little innovative growth and bring to life few new ideas or techniques, just nice new samples. Give him some time though. Brown's a good beat maker.

Words Paint Pictures is regrettably a little one dimensional, and Big Pooh makes hay of a racially beleaguered America, even if his critique on the public sector with Ras Kass is excellent. After ""Promise Land,"" the EP settles into fresh rhymes and cold chillin'. There are nine songs total, but the last two are remixes leaving seven ""originals."" Other guests besides Ras Kass include Steve Roxx, Eric ""Blakk Soul"" Keith, Marv Won, L'Orange and an awesomely lyrical triplet of Jalen Santoy, Novej and Lute in ""Kings.""

It would have been nice to hear Big Pooh suggest curative measures of conduct to combat the flaws of our current social order and system, but his questioning mentality and healthy skepticism are appreciated nonetheless. Likewise, Apollo Brown simply rolls out his music loops rarely with a surprise moment in the fold, but even if it is within a familiar comfort zone that he produces, the beats still possess harmonious, throwback beauty.",altern consciou hip hop approach mani angl glare style reus without expound extrapol offer solut sourc issu word paint pictur ep rapper big pooh durham north carolina trio littl brother fame detroit produc apollo brown come togeth spirit mello music group describ feel exig problem societi name policeonblack violenc feder govern wrongdo prison industri complex second ghetto black move part blossom pooh golden rap voic box play backdrop brown samplebas soul beat nice alway show littl innov growth bring life new idea techniqu nice new sampl give time though brown good beat maker word paint pictur regrett littl one dimension big pooh make hay racial beleagu america even critiqu public sector ra ka excel promis land ep settl fresh rhyme cold chillin nine song total last two remix leav seven origin guest besid ra ka includ steve roxx eric blakk soul keith marv lorang awesom lyric triplet jalen santoy novej lute king would nice hear big pooh suggest cur measur conduct combat flaw current social order system question mental healthi skeptic appreci nonetheless likewis apollo brown simpli roll music loop rare surpris moment fold even within familiar comfort zone,1488153600,3

42943,2301,778,"In much the same way that Run The Jewels with El-P and Killer Mike joined two pretty humongous, previously unassociated rap camps for a detour into cruel punk rap songs, Czarface (Wu-Tang Clan's Inspectah Deck with Boston's 7L & Esoteric) are putting their unique spin on the genre with a personality and mike-disposition nearly identical to RTJ's. Their self titled Czarface debut became an instant underground smash in 2013 and revealed that the Rebel INS plus 7L & Eso mix very well with each other.

Their second official release, Every Hero Needs A Villain, is almost a mirror-image of their first, save for a new set of guests (Method Man, Large Professor, Juju of The Beatnuts, GZA, MF Doom, Meyhem Lauren, R.A. the Rugged Man) and all- original rhyme verses in each track of course. In any case, EHNAV is a strong album sustained by epic, raw lyrics and more of 7L and Spada4's industrial and grunge rock-inspired alternative beats. Ambitious on both its vocal and instrumental fronts, the album's main concerns are to appall (with coarse, sometimes violent imagery), impress (with dizzying, nonstop rhyme schemes) and exhilarate (with artsy, indie, experimental production), and by all intensive purposes, they've more or less reached their goal.

Despite having few social implications or a variety of concepts (it truly has only one), EHNAV flourishes by being a rich greenhouse of thriving hip hop excitement, a wild comicbook-like rap album. The most important meaning behind this project however is its continuation of healthy collaboration between two rap acts from substantially different backgrounds, Inspectah Deck from the rough and tumble Staten Island, New York and producer/emcee team 7L & Esoteric from the more congenial backdrops of Boston, Massachusetts. Both have overlooked some of their cultural disparities to commune on their shared love for hip-hop.",much way run jewel elp killer mike join two pretti humong previous unassoci rap camp detour cruel punk rap song czarfac wutang clan inspectah deck boston 7l esoter put uniqu spin genr person mikedisposit nearli ident rtj self titl czarfac debut becam instant underground smash 2013 reveal rebel in plu 7l eso mix well second offici releas everi hero need villain almost mirrorimag first save new set guest method man larg professor juju beatnut gza mf doom meyhem lauren ra rug man origin rhyme vers track cours case ehnav strong album sustain epic raw lyric 7l spada4 industri grung rockinspir altern beat ambiti vocal instrument front album main concern appal coars sometim violent imageri impress dizzi nonstop rhyme scheme exhilar artsi indi experiment product intens purpos theyv le reach goal despit social implic varieti concept truli one ehnav flourish rich greenhous thrive hip hop excit wild comicbooklik rap album import mean behind project howev continu healthi collabor two rap act substanti differ background inspectah deck rough tumbl staten island new york produceremce team 7l esoter congeni backdrop boston massachusett overlook cultur dispar commun share love hiphop,1488153600,3

42945,2301,661,"Before producer/rapper Oddisee set his sights on blowing up Brooklyn and Arizona's Mello Music Group, he set Washington DC on fire, and before he took on our nation's capital, he was sizzling in his affluent Prince George's County, Maryland home base, all the time repping his ""P.G."" stomping grounds and his multicultural makeup. The son of an African American mother and a Sudanese father, a young Oddisee (real name Amir Mohamed) would split his residency between Sudan and the U.S., witnessing the juxtaposition of the two civilizations firsthand as a small boy. Later in life, with the world at his fingertips, he couldn't ignore his hip hop calling with which producing, or making beats, became his forte. With the help of the legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff, the Low Budget Crew, Diamond District and many others, Oddisee gained national recognition and is now thriving to the nth degree with Mello Music.

Making beautiful music with Mello Music Group since 2008, Oddisee is still very much hungry as his ambition shines through in The Good Fight for 2015. A real hip hop wiseman, Oddisee is overflowing with his feelings on unconditional love, relationship ills and the losses in life. Streams and streams of poignant, pensive rhymes from this natural master of flow testify to an unflinching tortured soul who doesn't hold himself back in the least bit. Oddisee ebbs and flows through his music like the push and pull of everyday life. ""Want Something Done"" explains the blues and joys of being an underground artist, and ""Contradiction's Maze"" documents the tug of war between right and wrong. Like his lyrical heft, Oddisee's beats keenly display the rich delectability his musical style is known for. Elegant, organic music and samples make for soulful, mellow boom bap orchestrated by Oddisee's gentle, talented hand. The Good Fight is another impressive Oddisee album, progressive and very consistent for this intellectual man. It definitely helps Oddisee's evolution as an artist, though not by leaps and bounds.",producerrapp oddise set sight blow brooklyn arizona mello music group set washington dc fire took nation capit sizzl affluent princ georg counti maryland home base time rep pg stomp ground multicultur makeup son african american mother sudanes father young oddise real name amir moham would split resid sudan u wit juxtaposit two civil firsthand small boy later life world fingertip couldnt ignor hip hop call produc make beat becam fort help legendari dj jazzi jeff low budget crew diamond district mani other oddise gain nation recognit thrive nth degre mello music make beauti music mello music group sinc 2008 oddise still much hungri ambit shine good fight 2015 real hip hop wiseman oddise overflow feel uncondit love relationship ill loss life stream stream poignant pensiv rhyme natur master flow testifi unflinch tortur soul doesnt hold back least bit oddise ebb flow music like push pull everyday life want someth done explain blue joy underground artist contradict maze document tug war right wrong like lyric heft oddise beat keenli display rich delect music style known eleg organ music sampl make soul mellow boom bap orchestr oddise gentl talent hand,1488153600,3

42950,2301,4121,"What's interesting about Time? Astonishing!, the new collaboration album between Mello Music Group producer L'Orange and Ultramagnetic's Kool Keith, is that it comes on the heels of their ""Sometimes I Feel"" joint from Mello Music's wondrous Persona LP so either they built off the creative spark of the song or an album was already in the works and they just wanted to give a sneak preview. No matter how it came about, it's still a dope album. L'Orange has once again put together a breathtaking spread of old time noir beats over which his compadre Keith raps science and swagger with the help of some of their favorite emcee friends.

As a slick, fourth dimensional rambler, the Kool Keith we witness here is as sharp with his bizarre, fanciful techniques as he was at the height of his Dr. Octagon phase, randomly ad-libbing strange ecological findings in our present time period and in the future. In fact forget ""strange"" because some of the scenes Keith describes are straight up outlandish, some might say crazy even. He may not be the belly laugh inducing character he has been at times, but he sure is every bit the cool, meticulous field researcher of his doctor side, with a new specialty: time-traveling. Nowhere is this more evident than in ""Twenty Fifty Three (2053),"" ""I Need Out of This World"" and ""Upwards. To Space!"", three short glimpses into what is most likely the fate of humankind, or at least where these artists believe it to be headed.

Let's not leave out L'Orange, a growing prodigy in his prime, who for all his skill at assembling his esoteric samples, vintage commercial clips and old movie-music loops still knows how to keep a beat with infectious hip hop drums akin to intelligent dance music. His beats are rapper- ready and at the same time, great all by themselves. Mad props must also go out to all the guests, for if not for them, Time? Astonishing! might just have been a short, sweet, two-man EP and nothing more. From top to bottom, they are J-Live, Mr. Lif, Open Mike Eagle, Blu, Montage One, DJ Trackstar, MC Paul Barman and MindsOne. Time? Astonishing! is alternative hip hop at its finest, and by beginning to explore the future of our species with intergalactic migration and cross-dimensional travel as possibilities, it certainly is venturing into unchartered territory, inside and outside of the music.",what interest time astonish new collabor album mello music group produc lorang ultramagnet kool keith come heel sometim feel joint mello music wondrou persona lp either built creativ spark song album alreadi work want give sneak preview matter came still dope album lorang put togeth breathtak spread old time noir beat compadr keith rap scienc swagger help favorit emce friend slick fourth dimension rambler kool keith wit sharp bizarr fanci techniqu height dr octagon phase randomli adlib strang ecolog find present time period futur fact forget strang scene keith describ straight outlandish might say crazi even may belli laugh induc charact time sure everi bit cool meticul field research doctor side new specialti timetravel nowher evid twenti fifti three 2053 need world upward space three short glimps like fate humankind least artist believ head let leav lorang grow prodigi prime skill assembl esoter sampl vintag commerci clip old moviemus loop still know keep beat infecti hip hop drum akin intellig danc music beat,1488240000,4
42951,2301,5883,"When Philly native, college business major, writer, actor, and visual artist David Burd took the plunge into hip hop, he was rewarded for his passion. Taking the sobriquet Lil Dicky, Burd matched his tongue in cheek rap songs about his everyday life to finely directed videos and found quick fame upon sharing them online. Under CMSN and David Burd Music, Professional Rapper, Dicky's studio debut, is no short order (an hour and a half run time in fact) of his highly lyrical comedy rap decorated by poetic small talk and flippant, ordinary comments. With grandstand hip hop production and interludes filled with random, Seinfeld-like chitter chatter, Professional Rapper is fun and funny with all the markings of young adulthood and is sure of its path without taking itself too serious. Lil Dicky has arrived at the majors.

David Burd, a product of the upper middle class, doesn't come from the ghetto. That much is certain. So what that leaves is studies on love, relationships, friendship, the workplace, and anything else that people of privilege occupy themselves with. Though he is a hip hop comedian, Lil Dicky does get philosophical here (""The Antagonist,"" one of the few intense moments, is a good example), and his song studying change ""Work (Paid For That?)"" shows Dicky is a pondering man's rapper. A particular group of songs on Professional Rapper though are important to note above the others.

The very ""Professional Rapper"" song was a wise choice for the second track/first actual song (""Meet The Burds"" is actually an interlude, or ""intro-lude"" if you like). In it, Snoop Dogg interviews Dicky for a rapper job, and it's simply a terrific interchange between them where the unique concept and sharp beat push them and their performance quality to excellence. ""Lemme Freak"" is the story of a couple (in this case Dicky and his girl) growing old together and Dicky's requests for sex through the years. Again, this original concept is followed through magnificently and the dialogue exchange between the characters with its exceptionally witty banter is just stupendous. Keeping with the romance/intimacy theme, ""Personality"" is important in that it stresses the role of individual identity and dignity in dating and meeting girls, and ""Pillow Talking,"" another two-way conversation song, explores the subtle dynamics of bedroom talk. Lastly, the angsty, scornful ""Antagonist"" briefly takes on this country's race and class issues.

Lil Dicky brings to rap a different perspective on life and a fresh approach to song-writing and song-making, or basically what amount to Professional Rapper's greatest strengths. With an LP as long as Professional Rapper, there's bound to be filler, and there is but not a lot here shockingly. He has put so much in the album possibly in the hopes that listeners see the lesser parts as a smaller issue, and he carries on a bit much funneling most of his creativity into close- knit lyrical powwows. Some of the songs are probably better experienced by watching their videos because Dicky is as good a visual artist as a vocal one. Guests besides Snoop include Brendon Urie of Panic at the Disco, Hannibal Buress, Fetty Wap, Rich Homie Quan, Jace of Two-9, T-Pain and Brain. Professional Rapper, a solid studio-start for Lil Dicky's rap career, is a true-to-self statement that is funnier than expected since in a way Dicky has set out to be funny on the album.",philli nativ colleg busi major writer actor visual artist david burd took plung hip hop reward passion take sobriquet lil dicki burd match tongu cheek rap song everyday life fine direct video found quick fame upon share onlin cmsn david burd music profession rapper dicki studio debut short order hour half run time fact highli lyric comedi rap decor poetic small talk flippant ordinari comment grandstand hip hop product interlud fill random seinfeldlik chitter chatter profession rapper fun funni mark young adulthood sure path without take seriou lil dicki arriv major david burd product upper middl class doesnt come ghetto much certain leav studi love relationship friendship workplac anyth el peopl privileg occupi though hip hop comedian lil dicki get philosoph antagonist one intens moment good exampl song studi chang work paid show dicki ponder man rapper particular group song profession rapper though import note other profession rapper song wise choic second trackfirst actual song meet burd actual interlud introlud like snoop dogg interview dicki rapper job simpli terrif interchang uniqu concept sharp beat push perform qualiti excel lemm freak stori,1488240000,3

42957,2301,2179,"War Report rappers from Queens, NY, Capone-N-Noreaga, or CNN, a period model of East Coast gangsta rap from the 90s and later, have returned to the game this year with Lessons, their fifth studio album and a familiar rollout of their famed street brand. Besides being almost painfully traditional for the duo, Lessons includes all new verse-material and original beats, which are conventional and come from an assortment of credible producers (Ayatollah, Hazardis Soundz, Beatz N Da Hood, etc). Their Queens homie and long time collaborator, Tragedy Khadafi (formerly Intelligent Hoodlum), plays a major and perhaps excessive guest-part and is joined by fellow features Royal Flush, The LOX, Anna Shay and Raekwon. Overall, these are loaded spots but uninteresting in their predictability. Capone and Noreaga do convey some different feelings in addition to hardcore street angst (the madness of ghetto crime in many instances of course, homie-love in ""U.M.A.R"" and lady-love in ""Chinese Girl"" for example) but they're in virtually the same format as all their previous releases. With low relevance, so-so rapping and outdated gangsterism and style, Lessons is a dwindling project from the emcees, whose peak is most likely behind them at this point.",war report rapper queen ny caponennoreaga cnn period model east coast gangsta rap 90 later return game year lesson fifth studio album familiar rollout fame street brand besid almost pain tradit duo lesson includ new versemateri origin beat convent come assort credibl produc ayatollah hazardi soundz beatz n da hood etc queen homi long time collabor tragedi khadafi formerli intellig hoodlum play major perhap excess guestpart join fellow featur royal flush lox anna shay raekwon overal load spot uninterest predict capon noreaga convey differ feel addit hardcor street angst mad ghetto crime mani instanc cours homielov umar ladylov chine girl exampl theyr virtual format previou releas low relev soso rap outdat gangster style lesson dwindl project emce whose peak like behind point,1488240000,1

42962,2301,2842,"Friend and protege of T.I. and signee to his Grand Hustle label, Young Dro (D'Juan Hart) from Bankhead, Atlanta, the same hometown as his King of the South mentor, was introduced to the world with fun street flair thanks to his ""Shoulder Lean"" hit from the 2006 album Best Thang Smokin', which fortunately for Dro, wasn't severely panned by critics, though it still mainly catered to rap's flash-fixated, fun-familiar and hood-curious audience. Seven years later, he avoided failure again with High Times, a still highly street album with enough lyrical mettle and unique production to garner praise. Now, Dro is back with an LP (his third) that outstandingly follows a ghetto-centric gutter music-following script with hardly any skillful lyrics or style-forward beats to pick from.

Dro begins in ""Black History"" with a burst of decent lyrics lasting less than a minute and never really explores black history itself. He then willingly becomes an active member of the trap community in the majority of the remaining tracks, and the 'xerox beats' he speaks over enter into the vicious cycle of uninventive, mainstream trends like copied drill, deep bass and other sounds of hip-hop production's past. In ""Power,"" Dro steps up his lyrical game a very little bit, speaking on his various gang alliances and such, but without amounting to lot more than plain gangsta rap, and Young Dro sounds like this gangsta path is his solution to life rather than a learning experience. To him, it's either that or what he thinks will move the most units.

In ""Hustle Gang,"" Dro sounds like a pretty obvious Future-imitation, a rather flagrant bite, before he ditches the auto-tune midway through the track. ""Feeling Myself,"" the only song worth paying any focused attention to, exhibits some humility, but because this one song is the only place on the album where we hear such selflessness, it's not believable, especially since all the other parts of Da Reality Show are so appallingly weak and superficial. In ""Testimonial,"" over soul-drenched strings, we get an interlude- speech of empowerment from none other than Dro's guest Iya, not him, so it doesn't amount to a hill of beans. Young Dro does a lot of 'woe-is- me'ing next to his label-mate and soul singer Ricco Barrino in ""Hood Gospel"" when he might want to just adjust his attitude and take action instead.

In too many parts of Da Reality Show, Young Dro just hoots and hollers like a banshee, dissing his haters, threatening and perpetrating violence, arranging drug packages, taking the initiative to rep his own status and complaining about his sorry chances in life. It's a good thing he hasn't invited any huge emcees on this album because they would probably make him look bad. Just so they do not get overlooked, the other guests are Trigga, Hollywood Luck, DB Bantino and Candice Mims. Young Dro has so much pride in his Hustle Gang clan, which is fine, but it might be at the expense of developing his personality and individuality, but the most troubling trait of Da Reality Show is its dumbed down gangsterism. Young Dro has some impressive vocal endurance, but what is the point if it is wasted on subject matter and tones that never enrich the listeners?",friend proteg ti signe grand hustl label young dro djuan hart bankhead atlanta hometown king south mentor introduc world fun street flair thank shoulder lean hit 2006 album best thang smokin fortun dro wasnt sever pan critic though still mainli cater rap flashfix funfamiliar hoodcuri audienc seven year later avoid failur high time still highli street album enough lyric mettl uniqu product garner prais dro back lp third outstandingli follow ghettocentr gutter musicfollow script hardli skill lyric styleforward beat pick dro begin black histori burst decent lyric last le minut never realli explor black histori willingli becom activ member trap commun major remain track xerox beat speak enter viciou cycl uninvent mainstream trend like copi drill deep bass sound hiphop product past power dro step lyric game littl bit speak variou gang allianc without amount lot plain gangsta rap young dro sound like gangsta path solut life rather learn experi either think move unit hustl gang dro sound like pretti obviou futureimit rather flagrant bite ditch autotun midway track feel song worth pay focus attent exhibit humil one song,1488326400,1

42964,2301,3356,"Verbal Kent (Dan Weiss) from Chicago's North Side, specifically Rogers Park, is no inexperienced spring chicken. A hip-hop professional since the late '90s starting his Organic Mind Unit band, the thirty-seven year old emcee has jumped record labels, collaborated and faced adversity but persists to write and spit rhymes. Currently on Mello Music Group, Kent has been active with the company every year since 2013, first with Apollo Brown and Red Pill for Ugly Heroes, then with a solo album, Sound of the Weapon in 2014, and now with another solo LP, Anesthesia (released September 11, 2015). Stocked with raw rhymes, mixed feelings and thoughts, nice guests and crafty sample-laced beats, Anesthesia is solid, no surprise for a fantastic alternative rapper of Kent's caliber, and although the only thing that is very fresh in it is the writing, the album is interesting at the very least.

Getting busy everywhere on Anesthesia with his rhyme-game, Verbal Kent gets his verbal calisthenics on in ""September,"" calls out Bill Cosby and Adrian Peterson in ""Suitcase Switch,"" and just shoots off other gruesome, vicious bars and lyrics with plenty of bite in later bits. Aside from the rough housing, our man on the mic gets deeply smart too. He looks at his past in ""Add Anesthesia,"" mentions Chicago his home in more than one instance, reflects on all of life's little joys and upsets with eloquence and subtlety in ""Is This My Life,"" and gives powerful lessons like ""learning to love along the way"" in ""Save Face."" Fate is then Verbal Kent's subject matter in the first part of ""Are You Ready,"" before he decides to leave us with more of the hardcore as the last tone taken at the end.

Typical yet titillating, Anesthesia provides some insight into the world of an aging Verbal Kent who might be less hungry but is more skilled and versatile in his career. With great producers (Marco Polo, Apollo Brown, Oh No, etc.) and guests (Freddie Gibbs, Skyzoo, Torae and Red Pill) on his album, which comes via the tremendous support of one of the most prominent indies in hip-hop today (Mello Music), Kent is riding a considerably great wave for a man of his modest yet explosively potent stature. The focus going forward will be on what new and fresh offerings he can bring to rap and hip-hop besides dope rhymes, which are what he has mastered and has been manufacturing and distributing for many years now. On Anesthesia, Verbal Kent takes our pain away, but he might want to follow it up with something greater, if he wants that pain to stay away.",verbal kent dan wei chicago north side specif roger park inexperienc spring chicken hiphop profession sinc late 90 start organ mind unit band thirtyseven year old emce jump record label collabor face advers persist write spit rhyme current mello music group kent activ compani everi year sinc 2013 first apollo brown red pill ugli hero solo album sound weapon 2014 anoth solo lp anesthesia releas septemb 11 2015 stock raw rhyme mix feel thought nice guest crafti samplelac beat anesthesia solid surpris fantast altern rapper kent calib although thing fresh write album interest least get busi everywher anesthesia rhymegam verbal kent get verbal calisthen septemb call bill cosbi adrian peterson suitcas switch shoot gruesom viciou bar lyric plenti bite later bit asid rough hous man mic get deepli smart look past add anesthesia mention chicago home one instanc reflect life littl joy upset eloqu subtleti life give power lesson like learn love along way save face fate verbal kent subject matter first part readi decid leav u hardcor last tone taken end typic yet titil anesthesia provid insight world age,1488326400,3

Music has become so bland, and CD singles so scarce these days, it is almost impossible to find interesting releases that are worth spending $6 for. Well, here is one, though I would rather have all 10+ mixes of ""Revolution"" in one disc, instead of having to wait until April 28 for the 2LP 12"" vinyl for the next instalment. Cannot but feel a little cheated, but noone is forcing me to purchase anything I do not want. This brand new CD single is a nice little DM addition to my collection, and I am happy to have purchased it. Truth be told, the song is nothing to get crazy about, though it is interesting to hear their ambiguous spiritual/political message, trying to get both sides talking. I find even more enjoyable the video with the brilliant Lenin references. Nonetheless, this is a tasty appetiser for the upcoming ""Spirit"" album.

43052,3851,5885,"Let me lay the backstory on you first, and Ill begin with the albums title Wednesday Morning, 3AM, debuting in 1964, coming from the fact that on a Wednesday night, our dashing duo had just finished their last song at 3AM in a Greenwich Village folk club, and were homeward bound to their digs in Queens  or perhaps it all had to do with the song Wednesday Morning, 3AM.  Regardless, the iconic photo was taken at that Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street stop.  The photo shoot proved problematic as several hundred images where taken that turned out to be unusable due to an all familiar suggestion that had been penned on the tiled wall, which inspired the writing of the future song A Poem On The Underground Wall, from the album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme.

Its not uncommon for an initial outing to be a mixed bag of original material, covers, and arrangements of traditional songs, which was the case here, with their cover of Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin ushering them into the inner circle for all things Bob Dylan, and gaining cross-over fans.  For the most part the album was largely acoustically focused, and largely unremarkable, so unremarkable, along with the invasion of The Beatles, that Simon & Garfunkel broke up, with Paul headed off to the UK, and Art going back to school.  It wouldnt be until the track Sounds Of Silence was reworked as the opening number on their following album, and was presented in a more haunting rock n roll manner, that Simon & Garfunkel secured a place on the musical map and never looked back.

The release was so overshadowed by the Sound Of Silence album that many people completely overlooked it, and with that hit single being on both albums [though as differing versions], it caused confusion for many.  Regardless, what shines most on this release are the traditional and cover songs, where the duo come off as energetic, harmonious, and emotionally sincere.  While sounding sincere and ambitious, the album comes across somewhat disjointed because of this non-original material, and the fact that the songs seemed to have been chosen at random, without consideration for the contextual flow needed for a concise body of work.  While certainly better than their Tom & Jerry [with name taken from the Tom & Jerry cat and mouse comic] material, theyve stepped headlong into an Everly Brothers / Peter, Paul and Mary-ish adaptation, making the album sound a bit flat, thin, campy and uninspired.

Im trying hard to bring something positive to the table, yet in all honesty, there is little I can say about this album to make it seem worth not only your while, but your investment.  The one thing Simon & Garfunkel did, which was similar, though not as dramatic as Dylan at Newport, was that they stepped out of the crooning vocal era of the late 50s, and into the folk scene, and then nearly single handedly reinvented the folk attitude, flying under the banner of folk-rock, though still heavy on the folk side  so yes, in a sense this is an important album as a bookmark of sorts, though holds little of lasting value.

I usually like to check out the original version of a song when I hear a cover, and as much as I like Boye, I found Adele's to be fantastic -- a melancholy but powerful ballad about a broken heart and a regretful lover, with an understated but moody musical accompaniment that lets Adele's majestic vocals.  Though I must admit I was a little disappointed to hear such a magnificent song, only to actually listen to the lyrics and discover it was yet another breakup song... there are more topics for songs than love and breaking up, folks...

Five SCINTILLATING Stars. In 1963, multiple Academy Award and multiple Grammy award-winning composer, arranger, pianist, and orchestra leader Henry Mancini composed the triple-Grammy winning and Academy Award-nominated ""The Pink Panther Theme"" for the eponymously-entitled comedic-heist motion picture co-written and directed by long-time Mancini associate Blake Edwards. The music was coordinated with the movement of the animated pink panther cartoon character in the opening credits and has been used in some of the 11 follow-on Pink Panther movies over 30 years. It is so closely associated with Peter Sellers who starred as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, though he only starred in about four of the movies.

The memorable Mancini musical theme was played by an orchestra made up of many of the same studio musicians associated with some of Mancini's greatest musical triumphs such as ""Peter Gunn"" and ""Mr Lucky"". Plas Johnson plays the widely-acclaimed tenor sax solo which conveys elegance, hipness, and musical buoyancy in a memorable performance. In addition, other Mancini stalwarts include Pete Candoli on trumpet, Dick Nash on trombone, Jimmy Rowles on piano, Shelly Manne on drums, Larry Bunker on vibes, Bob Bain on guitar, and Ted Nash and Ronny Lang on saxophones. The thrill of the performance beyond Johnson's key tenor sax role in stating the theme and performing the solo, include hot unison saxophone section riffs, the unison flute theme statement, unison trumpet section splashes, and key off-kilter pauses that add to the ambiance.

I've been a Tom Petty fan since the very first album, and even though this is not a proper Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers album, or even a Petty solo effort, I'd rank this among the best things he's ever done. Really, this is that strong an impressive a batch of songs.

The first Mudcrutch album was very good, but I think this one is even stronger. As another reviewer noted, there is indeed a Travelling Wilbury-esque vibe to many of these songs. Petty and his band sound looser, more confident, and more assured. It truly sounds like they are having lots of fun and that sense of joy permeates every one of these songs. Getting better with age?

43289,1788,3632,"Generally judged as one of the better psychedelic revival bands, Temples tosses its debut in the ring.  Electric twelve-strings and trippy lyrics dapple Temples walls, and a cathedral of reverb shovels a shadow of gauze atop the bands sunny, garage-rock blast.  While the foggy production keeps any one of Temples 60s/90s retro mix from standing out, a heavy Revolver-period Beatles influence is evident, as the opener Shelter Song echoes Tomorrow Never Knows, right down to the boxy snare.  However, Temples is not a Dukes of Stratosphear, wherein every tie-dyed reference is a tongue-in-cheek overstatement.  Instead, theres a reverence for its forebears, as much of Sun Structures suggests to what Journey to the Center of the Mind might have evolved, had Amboy Dukes founder Ted Nugent not gone wango-tangoing off the right-wing rails.",gener judg one better psychedel reviv band templ toss debut ring electr twelvestr trippi lyric dappl templ wall cathedr reverb shovel shadow gauz atop band sunni garagerock blast foggi product keep one templ 60s90 retro mix stand heavi revolverperiod beatl influenc evid open shelter song echo tomorrow never know right boxi snare howev templ duke stratosphear wherein everi tiedi refer tongueincheek overstat instead there rever forebear much sun structur suggest journey center mind might evolv amboy duke founder ted nugent gone wangotango rightw rail,1489363200,4

The best of his best to me has to be ""Born To Run"". There are many I know who have their own person favorite and could make a good argument for their choice of favorite Springsteen song. And I would agree with their reasons. But for me there is something about this early hit by the ""Boss"" that has an intensity level and sound to it that just can't be compared to any other. The longing and aching sung in the lyrics by Bruce of a guy who just wants to take his girl Wendy and find a better place for them, a better life. Bruce really gets into this song.

43361,2009,409,"It seems strange now with the hindsight of 46 years distance that 1971's hugely articulate ""Muswell Hillbillies"" by THE KINKS was such a commercial dog. Their newest platter and first with RCA Records was released November 1971 on both sides of the pond - but barely managed a No. 100 placing in the US LP charts with a big fat zilch in the UK.

But then again 1970's ""Lola Versus Powerman..."" and 1971's Soundtrack to ""Percy"" (both on Pye) hadnt bothered British LP charts either. In fact - excepting obvious crowd-pleasing hit singles between the LPs like ""Lola"" and ""Apeman"" and despite the musical-excellence of what Raymond Douglas Davies & Co. was collectively producing - the public seemed utterly indifferent  especially in their native Blighty. I can recall this album being in bargain bins for decades. Commercially this most British of bands were adrift in arguably their most creative period...

And that's where this rather excellent 2014 'Legacy Edition' 2-Disc reissue of ""Muswell Hillbillies"" comes in - determined to get us all to see the error of our fatuous ways. Armed with nine Bonus Tracks and a new DVD of period recordings on Disc 2 (all restored) - here are the cups of tea and pints of beer in the Archway Tavern...

UK released 19 December 2014 (10 November 2014 in the USA) - ""Muswell Hillbillies: Legacy Edition"" by THE KINKS on RCA/Legacy 88843093772 (Barcode 888430937727) is a 2-Disc Reissue and Remaster [1CD + 1DVD] that plays out as follows:

What the track list on the rear cover of this Legacy 2-Disc issue doesn't advise is that there's more footage on the DVD in-between tracks than is listed above. ""The Virgin Soldier March"" section includes the whole of the (rather rough) opening credits to the 1969 John Dexter movie ""The Virgin Soldiers"" starring Lynn Redgrave, Hywel Bennett, Nigel Davenport, Nigel Patrick and an uncredited David Bowie as a soldier (Wayne Sleep is credited). It features Ray's music playing throughout with the Mike Cotton Sound being the brass band accompanying him. There is also a short interview with Carl Foreman (clearly a fan of Ray Davies and his articulate writing) discussing how Ray's incendiary British lyrics were re-written/softened by the American studios so as not to offend or illicit riots in Washington (marches that didn't materialise). There is also interviews with the clearly bemused/amused owner of the grimy Archway Tavern Pub in North London and patrons supping pints being asked how they feel now that they've been immortalised on the gatefold album cover (cue more laughter). The Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble are also introduced by Davies to the live audience at The Rainbow and play with The Kinks on three tracks -  ""She Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina"", ""Alcohol"" and ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"".

The three-way foldout digipak offers a new period photo on the left flap with tape boxes pictured beneath each CD and its see-through tray. The 28-page colour booklet is a pleasingly well-endowed affair - pictures of Ray alongside black and whites/colours of the decidedly longhaired five-piece band. The booklet's front and back cover reproduce that photo where the 'Cats On Holiday' shop is all but obliterated by aluminium sheeting. The four-leaf foldout display of centre pages shows foreign picture sleeves for ""20th Century Man"" (Japan) and sheet music to ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"" as well as trade adverts and reviews - it even has a 26 June 1972 ticket stub for the Free Trade Hall in Manchester with Steve Goodman as the support act. IRA ROBBINS of New York provides the very entertaining and well-written liner notes - examining the album's themes of Her Majesty's Government interference in normal people's lives - inner city alienation - people in red coming to take him away - all of this working-class British angst wrapped up in American imagery of Shirley Jones, Errol Flynn and Doris Day.

ANDREW SANDOVAL - who handled all of the Universal 'Deluxe Editions' for The Kinks Pye years - is the Project co-ordinator once again. But the big news is a new Remaster - the first generation tapes transferred by RICHARD WHITTAKER at FX Mastering in London and the Remastering carried out by the vastly experienced VIC ANESINI at Battery Studios in New York. Anesini is a name I actively seek out - he's sprinkled his knob-twiddling fairy dust magic on the catalogues of Elvis Presley, Simon & Garfunkel, The Byrds, Nilsson, Santana, The Jayhawks, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mountain, Carole King and many more. This album was always a muddy mess to me - compounded by that 'Flexi' vinyl crap RCA engaged in at the beginning of the decade. There are hissy moments still on this remastered CD (the acoustic beginning of ""Holiday"" is just one of them) - but those slide guitars on ""Holloway Jail"" and the barroom piano on ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" now have more oomph for damn sure. That drum and guitar intro to ""Skin And Bone"" has fantastic punch all of a sudden - and there are other moments too. A good job done that's allowed the LP to breathe anew...

As Ray sings ""...I was born in a welfare state...ruled by bureaucracy...controlled by civil servants...and people dressed in grey..."" on the brilliant opener ""20th Century Man"" - you gather our Douglas is concerned once again for England's no-longer green and pleasant land and especially its increasingly homogenised and divided populace. Many critics commented on the depth of the song themes and lyrics (there's a lot of them) and their social commentary and insight  but it didn't seem to move the buying public in the same way. Just after the albums release - RCA put the song ""20th Century Man"" out as a US 45 in December 1971 (RCA Victor 74-0620) with the equally hard-hitting social consciousness of ""Skin And Bone"" on the B-side. But despite the lyrical/musical strengths of both sides - there were few takers. RCA Britain didn't even bother to support the album with a 7"" single - their first UK 45 on RCA Victor being the new ""Supersonic Rocket Ship"" in May 1972  which in itself acted as an advance promotion for the ""Everybody's In Show Biz"" double in August.

The hippy dream is dead and nailed to the wall in the brilliant ""Alcohol"" where some floozy has fleeced a heartbroken sucker - and The Kinks begin to sound awfully like Lindisfarne's ""Fog On The Tyne"" on ""Complicated Life"" (the accordion and guitars are clearer). You also notice how well he's integrated the Mike Cotton Sound brass ensemble into ""Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues"" and ""Holloway Jail"". I never was a fan of the 'Hallelujah Rosie Lea' cod nostalgia of ""Have A Cuppa Tea"" - but I'm loving the slide acoustic guitars of ""Uncle Son"" where The Kinks sound like Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance three years before the event. Recorded 17 October 1971 at Morgan Studios in Willesden, London - the album finisher and title track ""Muswell Hillbillies"" could easily be one of those Rolling Stones Country-Rock jaunts they throw so effectively into the Blues-Rock mix of their albums (""Let It Bleed"" and ""Sticky Fingers"" jump to mind).

And as ridiculously good outtakes - you'd have to call ""Lavender Lane"" (a sort of acoustic ""Waterloo Sunset""), ""Mountain Woman"" and the superb piano pain of ""Kentucky Moon"" - more evidence of the album's greatness (even the rejects were hitting the mark). The 50-second Radio Spot advert tells of ""Album of The Year"" from many American publications - but the public itself thought otherwise. It's also nice to see the Old Grey Whistle Test and Rainbow footage so clean - and dig those credits to ""The Virgin Soldiers"" movie from 1969 with Raymond Douglas Davies credited for the music (his full name used).

I'd admit that the hiss levels on some tracks are disappointing - but as I re-listen to this excellent remaster - I'm digging it more and more and my admiration for the LP has gone through the roof. Fans apparently magic-markered their song requests onto paper plates at gigs - flinging them stage-ward as the Band played.

You'd never know any time has passed at all since ""Balance"".  The guy is incredible.  I can't say there are any real standout tracks after 2 listens.  All in all it's a decent album but doesn't top Blessing in Disguise as my all-time favorite. Maybe if I'd have gotten the albums just prior to Howe's return I'd have a little more appreciation for this one.

EDIT: I went back and purchased the previous 4 albums with Ronnie Monroe on vocals, and after listenening to them a few times chronologically, I felt I needed to revisit this review.  Unfortunately XI seems to be a bit of a step down in the songwriting dept when from the previous albums & I've deducted one star from my initial review.

It was soothing, yes, but also haunting and mystic, hinting at strange mysteries that a younger me couldn't help but fall in love with.  The eerie Celtic-inspired music and the singer's dreamy vocals are entrancing, and weave a vivid picture in one's mind.

I've heard people compare Loreena McKennit to Enya, but in my opinion Enya is more saccharine to the ear.  McKennit isn't afraid to let the slightly darker and more haunting aspects of the music come to the fore, and for that I applaud her.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye (ear?) out for more of her music in the future.",first heard song mix cd creat friend famili simpli dub relax music song cd one stuck sooth ye also haunt mystic hint strang mysteri younger couldnt help fall love eeri celticinspir music singer dreami vocal entranc weav vivid pictur one mind ive heard peopl compar loreena mckennit enya opinion enya saccharin ear mckennit isnt afraid let slightli darker haunt aspect music come fore applaud ill definit keep eye ear music futur,1490659200,5

43644,2108,4700,"The first time I ever heard of King was on a roll up of Grammy nominees for this year. It featured a sound sample,and really enjoyed what I heard. This trio is made up of two sisters in songwriter Amber Strother and her instrumentalist sister Paris. They also have another member in Anita Bias. The pair culturally intersect their birth home of Minneapolis,being the daughters of local bluesman Percy Strother and in LA where they grew up. That's quite a significant musical intersection right there. In terms of the album,that back round provided a major curiosity as to where their general sound would go. Got the answers,and even than there's enough for still more questions.

  This album could be described as one that's separated into three ""suites"" of different types of songs. ""The Right One"",""The Greatest"" (a tribute to the late Muhammad Ali) and the closer ""Native Land"" are all cinematic mid 80's style electro funk numbers-filled with jazzy chord and key changes along with the trio's elaborate vocal harmonies. That singing approach carries over to the slower songs ""Supernatural"",""Love Song"",""In The Meantime"" and ""The Story""-all of which have an almost ambient subtlety to the same basic instrumental framework. Meanwhile ""Carry On"",""Mister Chameleon"" and ""Hey"" all showcase a shuffling retro girl group rhythm with more succinct three part harmonies.

  'We Are King' is definitely a singers album. But one that understands the importance of groups in that respect. Their harmonies,rather than solos get the priority. And the music has nothing to do with ego. Their chordally complex melodies are of a sort that require an epic sound. And they bring in that mixture of Jam & Lewis's work with the SOS Band (out of Minneapolis and LA,no less) as well as a strong dose of Afro Futurism to their conceptualization. Honestly,it might be my personal favorite album of 2016. It has a consistent sound that the trio do a lot with. And in the end,all of it really comes together in such a rhythmically beautiful way.",first time ever heard king roll grammi nomine year featur sound sampleand realli enjoy heard trio made two sister songwrit amber strother instrumentalist sister pari also anoth member anita bia pair cultur intersect birth home minneapolisb daughter local bluesman perci strother la grew that quit signific music intersect right term albumthat back round provid major curio gener sound would go got answersand even there enough still question album could describ one that separ three suit differ type song right oneth greatest tribut late muhammad ali closer nativ land cinemat mid 80 style electro funk numbersfil jazzi chord key chang along trio elabor vocal harmoni sing approach carri slower song supernaturallov songin meantim storyal almost ambient subtleti basic instrument framework meanwhil carri onmist chameleon hey showcas shuffl retro girl group rhythm succinct three part harmoni king definit singer album one understand import group respect harmoniesrath solo get prioriti music noth ego chordal complex melodi sort requir epic sound bring mixtur jam lewis work so band minneapoli lano le well strong dose afro futur conceptu honestlyit,1490659200,5

The group finally struck pay dirt in 1984 with a tune called ""On The Dark Side"" from the motion picture ""Eddie and the Cruisers"".  At long last this talented and hard-working outfit had themselves a major national hit. The single was originally released on the Scotti Brothers label in October 1983.  Listing the artist as ""Eddie and The Cruisers"" the song spent a total of 9 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart peaking at a rather lackluster #64.  But ""Eddie and The Cruisers"" would become something of a cult classic.  The record label saw fit to re-release the single In August of 1984.  Now the label credited ""John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band"" as being the artist.  The record got a ton of airplay and this time around the tune spent 18 weeks on the national charts peaking at #7.  What a terrific rock and roll record!

43939,2102,3728,"Animal + Cannibal is a repacked edition of her debut album ""Animal"" and its follow-up the EP ""Cannibal"". Kesha is very similar to her peer Lady Gaga, the two of whom debuted at the same time; the music is pretty much the same so if you love Lady Gaga you'll definitely love Kesha. The difference between her and Lady Gaga is that Kesha's style is harder, she's the ultimate party girl, and she on a mission here to party non-stop. The songs are primarily dance tracks, with slightly harsh electronic (I think its electroclash not to sure on the sub-genre), but surprising it suits her voice, Dr. Luke and his cohorts did a wonderfully job with production despite the harsh electronic background that surrounds her, Kesha doesn't get lost in the mix and its her that stand in the forefront. Most of the tracks (the really goods ones) revolve around drinking, party, and boys. But please don't think for a minute that she is just another puppet most of it is written or co-written by her and she can actually sing. (Something she better demonstrates on Deconstructed). My favorites from ""Animal"" are Dancing with Tears in My Eyes, Tik Tok, Kiss N Tell, Your Love is My Drug, and Take it Off.

43965,3833,5585,"He was a powerful force on the Billboard charts for more than a quarter century. Over the years this dynamic artist would prove to be not only a splendid singer but a talented musician and gifted songwriter to boot. His records were a fixture on American radio through most of the 60's, 70's and 80's. Yes, Stevie Wonder truly was and remains an American original.

During the 1960's Stevie Wonder made quite a few memorable records. You might recall his first big hit ""Fingertips - Pt 2"" which went all the way to the top of the charts in 1963! ""Little Stevie Wonder"" was just 12 years old when this tune was recorded and it quickly became obvious to all that this young man was a star in the making. During the 1960's Wonder would go on to have nearly two dozen charted singles including the rollicking ""I Was Made To Love Her"", ""Uptight (Everything's Alright)"" and the beautiful love song ""My Cherie Amour"" in 1969.

For all of the success he enjoyed in the 1960's Stevie Wonder would go on to even bigger and better things during the 1970's.  Stevie was definitely on a roll and five of his singles would make all the way to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart.  In the fall of 1976 Stevie Wonder released his masterpiece, the 2 LP set ""Songs In The Key Of Life"".  The album was an immediate smash debuting at #1 the week of October 16, 1976. It spent 14 weeks at the top of the charts and an impressive 35 weeks in the Top Ten.  The project yielded a total of 4 Top 40 singles two of which went all the way to #1.

As far as I am concerned ""I Wish"" is one of the two or three best singles Stevie Wonder ever released.  The tune earned Stevie a Grammy for the Best R&B Male Vocal performance of 1976.  This song has it all:  fabulous music, a powerful vocal and a dynamic lyric.  This is an artist who is clearly at the top of his game.",power forc billboard chart quarter centuri year dynam artist would prove splendid singer talent musician gift songwrit boot record fixtur american radio 60 70 80 ye stevi wonder truli remain american origin 1960 stevi wonder made quit memor record might recal first big hit fingertip pt 2 went way top chart 1963 littl stevi wonder 12 year old tune record quickli becam obviou young man star make 1960 wonder would go nearli two dozen chart singl includ rollick made love uptight everyth alright beauti love song cheri amour 1969 success enjoy 1960 stevi wonder would go even bigger better thing 1970 stevi definit roll five singl would make way top billboard hot 100 singl chart fall 1976 stevi wonder releas masterpiec 2 lp set song key life album immedi smash debut 1 week octob 16 1976 spent 14 week top chart impress 35 week top ten project yield total 4 top 40 singl two went way 1 far concern wish one,1491955200,5

44026,1472,1701,"""The Way It Is"" is one of those songs I originally thought was too tame, uninspiring and bland when it first came out, but about 15 years later and listening to it on headphones late one night, I realized there's a certain mood that really captivates me.  I didn't notice this the first time around.  The piano is smooth but also elegant, and the clean production adds a sense of purity.  Of course the lyrics ""That's just the way it is, some things will never change"" applies to many *many* situations in life, and the lyrics only become more relevant as the years go by.  Awesome song after all.",way one song origin thought tame uninspir bland first came 15 year later listen headphon late one night realiz there certain mood realli captiv didnt notic first time around piano smooth also eleg clean product add sen puriti cours lyric that way thing never chang appli mani mani situat life lyric becom relev year go awesom song,1492128000,5

44076,1627,5059,"As a long as I can remember, Weezer has been one of my all time favorite bands from my youth. When they finally came back from their long hiatus with their self title in 2001 they have been cranking out new music by the boat loads. Unfortunatly while there have been hits like 'Keep Fishin', 'Pork and Beans' and 'Memories', their albums as a whole have been hit or miss at best. Their previous album really made me feel that they were coming back to their classic ways with a very strong album in 'Everything Will Be Alright in the End' Their new self-titled 'White Album' is a long miss from that level. The songs are not memorable and the album just does not resonate.

I feel that like some of my other favorite bands this is another that I am just going to give up on when it comes to future releases. I feel that Weezer has left their mark on music but, there is no reason to stick around knowing that your band will not be forgotten.

The melody is beautiful, and the orchestration sounds typical of Mahler.  Some of movement 2 sounds too loud and chaotic, even strident; Mahler never wrote such repulsive music.  Movements 2-3 employ the harsh sound of trumpet more than Mahler would.  The themes of movement 3 sounds Mahlerian.  Some parts of movement 4 are frenzied, and I instinctively recoil from them.  On the other hand, there are some brief pretty melodies.  Mahler was not so profligate in his use of fff.  Movement 5: after the attack of the bass drum, the soft flute and violin melody was a welcome relief.  The tuba-bass drum-trumpet onslaught at 5-7 minutes is bad enough, only to be followed by harrowing musical experiences of more strident passages.  At 13 minutes a lovely melody in woodwinds and French horn enters, spoiled at 18 minutes by a dreaded crescendo.",movement 1 volum set right doubl ff passag passag pianissimo inaud problem without solut melodi beauti orchestr sound typic mahler movement 2 sound loud chaotic even strident mahler never wrote repuls music movement 23 employ harsh sound trumpet mahler would theme movement 3 sound mahlerian part movement 4 frenzi instinct recoil hand brief pretti melodi mahler proflig use fff movement 5 attack bass drum soft flute violin melodi welcom relief tubabass drumtrumpet onslaught 57 minut bad enough follow harrow music experi strident passag 13 minut love melodi woodwind french horn enter spoil 18 minut dread crescendo,1492387200,2

The song did first appear on the soundtrack of the film ""City of Angels,"" which I haven't seen, so perhaps the title has something to do with the movie?  *shrug*

At any rate, despite the possible confusion over the name, this is a lovely song, a love ballad with powerful guitar music and melancholy but warm and inviting vocals.  It's probably not the greatest love song of the '90s, but it's certainly one of the most memorable, and continues to resonate with listeners long after the film it debuted in has largely faded from memory.  Perfect for fans of the '90s or for love-song enthusiasts.",say idea song titl iri name doesnt crop anywher lyric dont believ song titl part lyric see queen bohemian rhapsodi green day good riddanc confus peopl tri search song onlin song first appear soundtrack film citi angel havent seen perhap titl someth movi shrug rate despit possibl confus name love song love ballad power guitar music melancholi warm invit vocal probabl greatest love song 90 certainli one memor continu reson listen long film debut larg fade memori perfect fan 90 lovesong enthusiast,1492560000,4

Now, as a grown up who watched a loved one fight and loose a battle with drug addiction, I get it.  And for a pop song, this is actually pretty haunting in it's sound.  But that is appropriate, because that is exactly what addiction does...it haunts not only the person who is using, but everyone in their lives.  And sometimes, like in the original video for this song, you end up with nothing but memories which will continue the haunting.  So many people think they're just signing on for a bit of fun, whether it's with street or prescription substances, and end up signing their lives away.  It's been 15 years this week since my brother passed away.  And it's a week that always haunts me, as does this song.  But I still love this song, even now that I am very painfully aware of what it means, it holds up very well to the passage of time, and not everything does.",go show age love song sinc first came time young enough didnt realli understand grown watch love one fight loo battl drug addict get pop song actual pretti haunt sound appropri exactli addict doesit haunt person use everyon live sometim like origin video song end noth memori continu haunt mani peopl think theyr sign bit fun whether street prescript substanc end sign live away 15 year week sinc brother pas away week alway haunt song still love song even pain awar mean hold well passag time everyth,1492819200,5

Yes, the music is the typical Trans-Siberian Orchestra blending of rock and classical music. However, the story is one that seems to echo in this time. I am so glad my friends gave me this album (2 CDs); I think you will miss something essential if you have only the streaming music or MP3 versions. The booklet included with the CDs adds depth to the sung story, not to mention Greg Hildebrandt's wonderful art deserves admiration.

I think this quotation is what I will take away: Do not dwell on the monstrous injustices done by humanity to humanity, since the dawn of mankind, more than you study how these wrongs and injustices were corrected. The study of the individuals and civilizations that overcame these evils is the key to mankind moving forward.

44258,15,5511,"There really have not been all that many songs that have really drove from the world of country music the past several years. The songs have either been gently from one zone in sales, but have not crossed over for better success or they just haven't had the chemistry that delivers for it with the work accomplished. For Keith Urban, he has had a lot of joy in his career with his success in country music. But overall, he has not had that widespread success cross over into the pop world, as was the case with Shania Twain or Faith Hill had delivered. Now, with a slew of good performances he has had, he now is trying to cross over with pop with his latest single, The Fighter from his album, Ripcord. the song, which features Carrie Underwood, works well for him as a solo track, but as a duet it misses the mark a bit. Carrie Underwood surprisingly underperforms on the song with having more of a voice into the pop anthem. While it sounds like a hit for Keith, and it is, there could've been a bit more chemistry into the track overall. It is a good download for die hard Keith Urban fans, but there could've been more from Carrie for a higher score.

44271,1788,4814,"If you're one of the moral minority with a healthy disdain for stock drum machine rhythms, sound-alike synth patches, and vocals that are compressed, de-essed, and auto-tuned to the point of emotional sterility, then dive right into Lake Street Dive.  Side Pony is the bands fifth release, another refinement of the bands original sound conceived by the quartet at the New England Conservatory and birthed in Boston.  No, this is not a hoity-toity recital of sterile adroitness.  Lake Street Dives chops rock a side pony (its a hairstyle) with doses of retro soul, R&B, jazz, rock, and Brill Building banter.  Vocalist Rachael Price belts out a fierce independence, and bandmates Mike McDuck Olson (guitar, Rhodes, and trumpet), Bridget Kearney (upright and electric bass), and Philadelphias Michael Calabrese (drums and percussion) answer in kind.  Its all in the key of fun.

44347,1421,5766,"This is one of those albums that I really wanted to like, or least wanted to like more than I did. Not sure what the problem was for me. This ""type"" of music is normally the sort of stuff that I love. It's a very soulful blend of music (pop, rock, R&B, whatever you want to label it) with some definite retro roots in the old Stax and Hi Records sound. Great organ playing too. And yet, two dozen plays later, it never left a strong impression on me.

Honestly, it really bothers me that I didn't get into this album that much. I had such high expectations after reading so many glowing reviews and positive articles about the band and I'm truly disappointed. The vocals of the lead singer aren't bad, but neither are they particularly distinct or memorable. While I admire the group's obvious love of old soul music, the overall sound is a bit derivative and nothing special. And that sums up most of the songs too. Clearly, this band has their hearts --- and soul --- in all the right places, but it feels, and sounds, like something crucial is missing.",one album realli want like least want like sure problem type music normal sort stuff love soul blend music pop rock rb whatev want label definit retro root old stax hi record sound great organ play yet two dozen play later never left strong impress honestli realli bother didnt get album much high expect read mani glow review posit articl band im truli disappoint vocal lead singer arent bad neither particularli distinct memor admir group obviou love old soul music overal sound bit deriv noth special sum song clearli band heart soul right place feel sound like someth crucial miss,1493337600,3

44646,6277,1951,"I have always, always loved Mozart.  But that's not why I purchased this. I bought several of the ""Rise of the Masters"" collections a few years back shortly after our son was diagnosed with his sensory processing disorder.  An OT recommended The Listening Program, but my little man doesn't do headphones.  And everything I looked at study wise on that seemed to be mixed, with some studies indicating that listening to plain classical music alone would produce similar benefits.  So I purchased these to play quietly in the background as we did other things.  Of all of the collections we got, he tolerates Mozart the longest.  I always knew that kid of mine had great taste ;)  The thing that to me is the stand out thing about this product is how many tracks you get for the price, and the quality if fine for what we were using it for.",alway alway love mozart that purchas bought sever rise master collect year back shortli son diagnos sensori process disord ot recommend listen program littl man doesnt headphon everyth look studi wise seem mix studi indic listen plain classic music alon would produc similar benefit purchas play quietli background thing collect got toler mozart longest alway knew kid mine great tast thing stand thing product mani track get price qualiti fine use,1494028800,5
44647,6277,1954,"This is one where I'm rating it pretty much based on value.  This is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" Collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son.  We've been trying to get him to tolerate headphones as part of the OT treatment plan for him.  In the clinic setting it's pretty much not happening at all, at home we occasionally can for short periods of time, but usually not, so it's a hill we've been dying on forever.  So this is a work around it kind of solution, where we were/are trying to do the best we can to support everybody on their/his therapy goals, while working with where our son is at, because as I was looking at the studies for ways to try and make this work for our family I saw that some of them indicated traditional unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits to the modulated music used as part of the AIT process in occupational therapy. Now the first track on this collection, it starts off very, very quiet.  Which I'm sure he doesn't mind because he has very sensitive hearing, but I have a hard time hearing it, and the first time it played I found myself wondering ""Is this working right?"" but then the volume picks up part way through the track.  We usually don't make it through this collection any further then the first track, because the Romeo and Juliet music has a more tense sound to it, and he struggles more with that in music.  He tends to like things that sound zippy, happy, and upbeat, and isn't a big fan of music that emotes tension, anger, those kinds of things.  So it's not one we get through much on usually, but it's a great value and price point for the number of tracks.",one im rate pretti much base valu one 7 rise master collect purchas part sensori integr therapi program son weve tri get toler headphon part ot treatment plan clinic set pretti much happen home occasion short period time usual hill weve die forev work around kind solut werear tri best support everybodi theirhi therapi goal work son look studi way tri make work famili saw indic tradit unmodul classic music produc similar benefit modul music use part ait process occup therapi first track collect start quiet im sure doesnt mind sensit hear hard time hear first time play found wonder work right volum pick part way track usual dont make collect first track romeo juliet music ten sound struggl music tend like thing sound zippi happi upbeat isnt big fan music emot tension anger kind thing one get much usual,1494028800,5

Again, this is one of 7 ""Rise of the Masters"" collections I purchased as part of a sensory integration therapy program for our son, who has a deeply entrenched dislike of headphones.  Actually, that's an oversimplification.  It would be more accurate to say that they feel radically different on his head then they would to you or I and he  still can't tolerate that sensation well most of the time, and there's probably a sensitivity to sound component in there as well.  Usually the best we can get is for him to allow them around his neck for a short period of time while one of his favorite movies plays on my kindle.  Music generally is too unmotivating to even get him to try and deal with the headphones from his perspective.  Since the type of Auditory Integration Therapy used by my son's OT clinic uses headphones, we've been kind of dying on that hill, but some of the studies into the efficacy of this method for treating sensory issues have indicated that traditional, unmodulated classical music can produce similar benefits.  So we purchased these a while back as a work around it, trying to still get the job done kind of solution and have been quite satisfied with them.

44670,523,2691,"Having had, at one time, THE BEST OF PHOEBE SNOW vinyl LP, it was often played and had a limited lifetime.  My two favorite tracks were of course her magnum opus Poetry Man which gave her star status out of the starting gate with her first album; and secondly her fantastic take on The Beatles Don't Let Me Down.  I wanted these two replaced so badly, I purchased them as digital downloads for my phone music player as soon I saw the 2001 release of the VERY BEST OF CD which expands on the original by 6 more tracks.  Ms Snow's first and foremost talent is that four-octave bluesy contralto that was unique in the 70's and still is today (sadly she passed 6 years ago last month); then there is her unique finger play on ""lead"" acoustic guitar, a velvety touch with lilting grace that hammers at just the right accent spots for making her music style all her own.  Poetry Man is also a one-of-a-kind piece of musical art, it seems to occupy a space somewhere between jazz, folk, and the blues, a space where there seems to be no competition and was simply way ahead of its time.  The closest in musical style you can come to it is Dave Matthews' work, his own being an artistic spot where the three genre experiment with each other, close but not quite like Phoebe Snow.  Her Calypso inflected Beatles cover is also highly unique and Snow just owns it.  One of my favorite songs by my favorite artist, she took it from them and bent it slightly around the middle, making a blues rock composition into a Caribbean gospel folk ballad.  The Gospel Choir never overwhelms Snow's perfect-pitched delivery and her soft-scat coda.  If you download either of these two gems, and you seriously love them (how can you not?) then I urge you with all sincerity to grab hold of the VERY BEST OF PHOEBE SNOW CD.",one time best phoeb snow vinyl lp often play limit lifetim two favorit track cours magnum opu poetri man gave star statu start gate first album secondli fantast take beatl dont let want two replac badli purchas digit download phone music player soon saw 2001 releas best cd expand origin 6 track m snow first foremost talent fouroctav bluesi contralto uniqu 70 still today sadli pas 6 year ago last month uniqu finger play lead acoust guitar velveti touch lilt grace hammer right accent spot make music style poetri man also oneofakind piec music art seem occupi space somewher jazz folk blue space seem competit simpli way ahead time closest music style come dave matthew work artist spot three genr experi close quit like phoeb snow calypso inflect beatl cover also highli uniqu snow own one favorit song favorit artist took bent slightli around middl make blue rock composit caribbean gospel folk ballad gospel choir never overwhelm snow perfectpitch deliveri softscat coda download either,1494288000,5

44684,523,541,"Roberta Flack's First Time Ever I Saw Your Face debuted on her first album FIRST TAKE in 1969 and took the radio waves by storm.  There wasn't a pop, soul, or even jazz station that was not playing it in regular rotation.  It rocketed Robert to instant stardom and her voice became one of the most recognizable ballad singers of the 70's.  One listen and you know there was a subtle and beautiful power there.  Modern soul/R&B singers have not a clue as to how to command a vocal like this.  Now it is all about ""runs"" and unrestrained power.  Take a lesson everone, this is how you deliver a beautiful ballad.  If you want more, lay your ears on her cover of The Three Degrees ""Trade Winds"" another Roberta Flack hit that utilizes gorgeous vocal delivery, subtle jazz and soul instrumentation, and a slow burn to building crescendo.

44801,121,4609,"I'm on a voyage of discovery, widening my collection and experience of Prog from the classics of the first generation era I grew up with.

And I found The Astonishing somehow having heard not note one from Dream Theater. Found it, bought it, played it.

Wow. An astounding product in this day and age.

Two disc, two hour plus SF rock opera, composed in a heavy prog-rock style. Epic doesn't begin to describe it.

Excellent quality sound. I can hear most of the lyrics above the instrumental goings-on, which is a bonus. I'm old and my ability to discern one sound from many is sometimes not as good as it should be. Laugh away, whippersnappers, it will come one day to you.

And packaging production the likes of which I haven't seen since the heyday of gatefold vinyl album covers. It made me sad for the days when I'd have been able to look at it taking up three square feet of space when unfolded. Seriously great artwork and graphic design. The art looks like the sort of stuff Riven had in it - not the subject matter, the hi-def art finishing. Brilliant.

The booklet is bound into the cardboard sleeve so the whole is sort of like what you got with Fragile in '71 or Living in the Past. Ha. Irony. This harkens back to the days when albums were multi-media experiences, and the listening was done with the cover open and a lyric sheet to hand.

The story? Well, it's a bit precious but who cares? We are not talking Nebula Award wining SF here, but we know that going in and have no expectations on that score (no pun intended). The playing is virtuoso, the singers in tune (as far as I can tell but I no longer have a perfect musical ear thanks to years of loud noises going in them as often as I could arrange it) and the music melodic with periods of heavy moving in from the west.

And best of all, I'm fairly new to second (and third) generation prog rock, and my last Big Find (Glass Hammer) had a few moments when ""referencing"" other, earlier groups fell into pastiche, derailing the listening experience until I was used to it. Dream Theater sound only like Dream Theater to me. Maybe I am not widely experienced enough in the latter day prog rock scene to say that, but I don't care.

I loved this on first hearing. I don't mind challenging pieces but it was a distinct pleasure to come upon one that required no work just to listen to it (sometimes I'm in the mood, sometimes I'm not).

44841,6321,5434,"Fantastic collection from the sneeeeshht mister himself. Growing up, I was a John and George man, being more drawn to songs like The Inner Light, Within Without You, Norwegian Wood and Rain. Especially since the early McCartney cd issues generally sounded like they needed an upgrade (though not as bad as the horrible 80s Beatles cds) I never really dipped into Maccas solo career. With the announcement of the Paul McCartney Archive reissues I started seeing what I had missed. This collection in particular is a really well rounded collection that will have you obsessed with Paul by the end of it. I really wish Call me Back Again and Love in Song (with its Indian/modal sounds like a big inspiration for songs like The Numbers from Radioheads Moon Shaped Pool) from Venus and Mars were collected here as they are among my favorite Paul McCartney numbers ever. Momma Miss America from his debut is an amazing instrument with Paul playing all the instruments and with its White Album vibes definitely deserved a spot on a 4 cd collection. Some notes/reactions to the ditties; Silly Love Songs  Wow, what can I say. I must be getting old and dorky (31) because I love this song. Not that I don't love the LSD days of the aforementioned John and George Songs anymore, but Ive come to love Silly Love Songs. Im not really sure what this song was supposed to be fighting. Paul had just realeased Band on the Run and Venus and Mars and most of these songs and non album singles of the era aren't really little ditties pop songs that Silly Love Songs is a reaction too. Anyways its very much a disco era pop sneessht hit that reaches 6 minutes. Love it. Pipes of Peace a great single with interesting use of table (was pretty surprised to hear table in a 1983 McCaryney single). Listen What the Man Said Another smooth commercial sounding song, I would have dismissed back in the day, but now just comes across as so good, that I want to hear it over and over again. Wanderlust  a great orchestral type song with George Martin producing. The melody is based on a part of Symphony no. 3 by Camille Saint Saens and has been covered by Brian Wilson. This song is from Tug of War this album made me realize I was missing out on not giving Maccas solo career more of a shot. Band on the Run  the closest he got to prog in his solo career.

44858,1788,3408,"Produced by The E Street Bands Steven Van Zandt, this CD is nothing but a good time!  The irony in the album title is that that Love is a well-known shadow singer, having sung backups and harmonies for an array of artists including Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Sonny & Cher, Dionne Warwick, The Beach Boys, and even U2.  Her Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home) is a signature holiday staple, which she reprises each year in a NYC holiday show.  She appeared in 20 Feet from Stardom, the 2013 documentary on the lives of backup singers to the stars.  Love turns 76 this year [2017], and, if this album is any indication, shes about as far from a rocker and a shawl as one can get.  Among the Believers (a Van Zandt original) bangs open the doors, and 13 tracks later, Jesus Is the Rock (That Keeps Me Rollin) (another Van Zandt rant) takes the party home with an all-out gospel shout.  In between, new songs by Linda Perry, Elvis Costello, Jimmy Webb, Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil, and Bruce Springsteen give Love fresh material to make all her own.  The roots of rock and R&B lace through every song on the disc, giving new power to Loves girl-group origins.  But the hands-down highlight is Loves rip through River Deep, Mountain High, which should come with a warning  it will inspire impromptu air-mic moves that could be downright embarrassing, depending on where you hear this.",produc e street band steven van zandt cd noth good time ironi album titl love wellknown shadow singer sung backup harmoni array artist includ elvi presley frank sinatra sonni cher dionn warwick beach boy even u2 christma babi plea come home signatur holiday stapl repris year nyc holiday show appear 20 foot stardom 2013 documentari live backup singer star love turn 76 year 2017 album indic she far rocker shawl one get among believ van zandt origin bang open door 13 track later jesu rock keep rollin anoth van zandt rant take parti home allout gospel shout new song linda perri elvi costello jimmi webb barri mann cynthia weil bruce springsteen give love fresh materi make root rock rb lace everi song disc give new power love girlgroup origin handsdown highlight love rip river deep mountain high come warn inspir impromptu airmic move could downright embarrass depend hear,1494979200,5

With the shocking news of the passing of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, it is just another tragic reminder of Rock & Roll excess from drugs, alcohol and depression.

44908,4876,570,"Having read other people's reviews on this latest live album from Van Halen, I feel like putting in my 2 cents' worth as well.  I've been following all of VH's records (including the solo albums by David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, respectively) since 1997, and they have gotten better over time.  I desperately wanted to get my hands on any VH album that was available -- whether by vinyl, cassette, or CD.

With the frequent personnel changes (i.e. Roth, Hagar, Cherone, then Roth again, then Wolfgang replacing Michael Anthony), it's a wonder how VH has stayed intact for so long.  But I have to give Eddie Van Halen and brother Alex for STILL having the energy of teenagers to pull off such awe-inspiring, amazing guitar/drum solos.  It really shows on each song.

As for Roth, he's basically off-key and off-balance, ruining many of the songs that make the band famous in the first place (""Unchained"", ""Everybody Wants Some!!"", ""I'll Wait"", ""Romeo Delight""); however, I do give him an A+ for effort and still wanting to rock -- even now in his 60's.  Which is why it saddens me so much that his hot hell yelps, screaming banshee wails, and top octave range are all but GONE.  Still, it doesn't change how I feel about him as an overall individual; he deserves many accolades for the powerhouse voice that he USED to have.

Eddie, on the other hand, went through a very painful divorce with Valerie Bertinelli, dealt with hand surgery, and fired Michael Anthony because the (alleged) reason was that Michael was working with Hagar in his supergroup, Chickenfoot.  Enter, Eddie's son -- Wolfgang Van Halen.  Wolf pulls off all of the moves that Michael had, nearly note for note; you can clearly hear it when he battles it out alongside Eddie's solos and Alex's drums on ""Hot For Teacher"", ""Ice Cream Man"" and ""You Really Got Me.""  Wolf has DEFINITELY got a huge, promising musical career ahead of him.  :)

Of course, Eddie HIMSELF steals the show!!  For anyone that has loved hearing his solos for the past 4 decades, you won't be disappointed here.  The songs where he stands out the most are ""And The Cradle Will Rock..."", ""Panama"", ""Tattoo"", ""Mean Street"", and ""Jump.""  But the HUGE kicker is ""Eruption"" when he starts out with his usual wailing, ear-shattering solo (and deftly battling it out with Alex's fast and furious drumming) before he segues into 1983's ""Cathedral"" from the Diver Down album, then back to ""Eruption"" once again.  He'll definitely go down in history as one of the greatest guitar gods of the 20th/21st century, giving Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton a run for their money.  :)

So where does VH go from here??  Whom really knows, but since I am still a huge superfan of ALL 4 members (PLUS Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony), I'm still going back to hearing those early records.",read peopl review latest live album van halen feel like put 2 cent worth well ive follow vh record includ solo album david lee roth sammi hagar respect sinc 1997 gotten better time desper want get hand vh album avail whether vinyl cassett cd frequent personnel chang ie roth hagar cheron roth wolfgang replac michael anthoni wonder vh stay intact long give eddi van halen brother alex still energi teenag pull aweinspir amaz guitardrum solo realli show song roth he basic offkey offbal ruin mani song make band famou first place unchain everybodi want ill wait romeo delight howev give effort still want rock even 60 sadden much hot hell yelp scream banshe wail top octav rang gone still doesnt chang feel overal individu deserv mani accolad powerhous voic use eddi hand went pain divorc valeri bertinelli dealt hand surgeri fire michael anthoni alleg reason michael work hagar supergroup chickenfoot enter eddi son wolfgang van halen wolf pull move michael nearli note note clearli hear battl alongsid eddi,1495152000,3

All of their albums are among my ""deserted island"" albums - albums you would take with you if you had to live on a deserted island - but POSITRACTION is actually my FAVORITE album they have ever done to date!

It opens with the awesome title track: a dreamy, rhodes-piano-infused upbeat funk groove that you could almost hear on a Jamiroquai or Incognito album (other bands I happen to love). From the opening bars, this is what music is supposed to be. Music that UPLIFTS your day! This is one of those songs you keep hitting repeat on because you never want it to end!

The rest of the album does not disappoint, giving you James Brown type funky jams; dreamy exotic jazz with cool jungle/drum n bass beats; nice electronica mixed with chilled out late-night funk grooves that sound like a smokey NYC alley at 2:00 in the morning; and even some exhilarating upbeat Brazilian samba sounds to boot.

One of the faves on the album is ""Cookie Strut,"" the first radio single from the album. This track is as cool (and smooth) as ice with a soulful R&B beat punctuated by sultry electric piano, hand claps and sweet bluesy guitar riffs. Classic Four80east at its best (!!!!)

Can we swim a lake by the ocean, Well be one like drops in slow motion. - Maxwell, Lake By The Ocean.

(Courtesy of Amazon Prime Music)
Five GROOVING Stars. From the 2016 album blackSummersnight, this is the Grammy Award-winning song by the double Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, musician, producer, and actor Maxwell. He has planned his musical career over long periods of time, followed by his eagerly-awaited albums becoming hits and spawning hit singles. Considering the significant gaps of time between them, up to 7 years, including 2 albums from the trilogy with variations of the words blacksummersnight, his artistry has shown bright throughout his career. This album was preceded by the 2009, Grammy-winning album, Blacksummersnight.

On Lake by The Ocean, written by Musze (Maxwell) and Hod David, which won the Grammy for Best R&B Song, Maxwell establishes a definite catchy groove that persists throughout the song and drives the simple, repetitive, but brilliant lyrics. Over a deliberate beat from the urgent drums, Maxwell uses his natural range voice to tell the story, switching to his falsetto voice range to raise the intensity with repetition of the refrain on this song. This song lingers in the mind long after the music has stopped. The musical support group includes the likes of Hod David on bass and other instruments, Robert Glasper on keyboards, Darryl Lil Man Howell or Mark Colenburg on drums, Derrick Hodge on bass, and others.

Lou Reed strums a relaxed guitar, the drums are played with quietly swinging brushes. It feels like both an intimate after hours gathering on an empty, graffiti-covered subway car, and bedtime story hour at an 'adults only' bookstore. A lullaby for artistic freaks, fiends and friends living in a depraved and dirty, yet stimulating and inspiring city where anything goes. An ode to the characters who came to New York and became part of Andy Warhol's factory crowd.

45110,1301,3551,"I have a story about the first time I heard Roundabout. I was seven years old, and I was at church camp in the summer of 1974. I slept on a top bunk in a green cabin. Previous occupants had written weird stuff on the ceiling. Anyhow, I didn't like being at camp too much, but there were these hippie junior ministers who played acoustic guitars and had us sing hippie religious songs, like I am the resurrection, and tunes from Godspell. They were pretty cool. They also had a Chevy van with these big speakers that weren't locked down to anything. So, one night we were going somewhere and I got to ride in the van. I got in it and someone put one of the speakers in my lap and said I had to hold onto it. They turned on the stereo and I soon felt an amazing vibration surge through my hands and into my brain and I had no idea what was going on...but it was like some kind of epiphany. I didn't know it was Roundabout at the time. But I recognized it when I eventually heard it again, and I knew it was Chris Squire's Rickenbacker bass that had affected me so much.

That bass comes in at 0:45. It has this woody, round texture, almost like a thick cord of elastic rope, this is what it feels like to me. Rick Wakeman's keyboard riff at 1:53 is pretty dramatic as well. We had a pipe organ at my church, so I probably thought this was another hippie religious song.

I used to sit in our comfy brown swivel chair next to the stereo with the headphones on and read the lyrics and look at the gatefold photo. I'd sit there and wonder how the one kid got to be on the other side of the fence. And the kid in the middle looked sad and kind of out of place, but he seemed pretty cool, too. I always liked how Ringo was at kid height, all hunkered down. The lyrics to the songs were printed on the sleeves, so you could follow along. I really liked Paperback Writer because it told a story and I liked books, and it wasn't about girls and all that hold your hand stuff. The way the vocals cascade all over themselves from the top, and the way they echo around after writererererer....so trippy .The guitar riff is great, but i don't think I appreciated it at the time.

The song opens with a bang, starting off with that great ringing guitar chord and the all the guys belting it out on the chorus. The verses are choppy little two steps, the narrator telling his story of woe as his former girlfriend walks past his house with 'another guy-e-ay.' Night falls and he's all alone and imagines she is telling her new guy all the nice things she once told him.

The chorus is such a smash, the drums are fantastic, I especially like the long fill around 2:35 during the fade out. And how about the primary five note guitar riff?

My Mom would have the radio on and I would lay down and watch as the various neon lights of fast food chains were reflected on the window. We might head to McDonalds for some 'food' or a 'milkshake'. There is a down to earth late night quality to this song, the reverb on the vocals and music, the simple jangly guitar chords, the drum fills. I always liked the name-checking of the various cities in the US - Phoenix, Tacoma, Philadelphia, Atlanta, LA. When I got older I often wondered why Tacoma was included, since it's way smaller than the other ones. I thought it might have been a nod to the Tacoma Dome, but that wasn't constructed until 1983. It must be that it sort of rhymes with Arizona. Arizona - Tacoma - Oklahoma - Bologna. Catchy stuff, Steve Miller. He includes all of northern California in his lyrics. Why limit himself to one city when 'the girls are warm' in an entire area? There were probably a lot of girls in northern Cali who heard this song and thought, ""Hey, I live in northern California and I'm warm.

As the title eludes to, Is this the life.. is a bleak & stark affair, with dystopian themes running throughout the entire album & Waters aged voice adding extra gravitas.
The only criticism that I have, is occasionally Walters does sound a little like a one-trick-pony & theres a fair bit of effing & jeffing which I don't think he needed to resort to make a his  various points.
So unlike his musical nemesis David Gilmour Is this the life.. probably won't be troubling the top end of the hit parade, but I don't think that will bother Waters one bit, as his has created an album that mirrors the mood & the state of the world at the present to a tee, fascinating.",confess littl surpris found nigel godrich go produc water new album reput bit hard task master godrich produc paul mccartney chao creation album would make macca go away work thought song written wasnt good enough even though roger singl mind say least godrichwat dynam bore excel fruit titl elud life bleak stark affair dystopian theme run throughout entir album water age voic ad extra gravita critic occasion walter sound littl like onetrickponi there fair bit ef jef dont think need resort make variou point unlik music nemesi david gilmour life probabl wont troubl top end hit parad dont think bother water one bit creat album mirror mood state world present tee fascin,1496534400,4

The sound is what i have always loved from 3DD, heavy base drums, good guitar, riffs etc .. but even after weeks of listening i just don't find myself actually liking any of the songs or wanting to hear them when i get in the truck.
the test comes after that first week when i punch back over to the radio or my phone or whatever .. do i catch myself thinking about track number .. whatever .. and wanting to hear it? .. well, i didnt.
after a week sitting in the player i had forgotten all about it .. i ran it through again and even though i knew the words to a few tracks now, i just wasn't feeling it .. i would normally say something like ""uninspired"" or something like that, but i know these guys don't just put down music for no reason .. so all i can say is that i am not feeling it.
pulled it out friday to put the new Saving Abel in and the final test was that none of the songs from this disc made their way over to my ipod .. it went on the shelf with all my other 3DD discs and will probably stay there .. first and only release of theirs not represented in my ipod at the moment .. disappointed.

The Boys Are Back in Town is a straight up rock classic. It features the twin lead guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson, bass and lead vocals by the late great ultra-talented Dubliner Phil Lynott. Look him up on youtube, there are at least two pretty cool documentaries about him. Lyrically and vocally, it always felt to me like an American Bruce Springsteen New Jersey kind of song, to wit:

And that time over at Johnny's place,
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't want to know, forget her

Battle of Evermore. Misty Mountain Hop also. Some LZ fans want every song to be about Lord of the Rings: 'hey dude, that song Hot Dog? It's about the hobbits wanting to enjoy some elevensies, you know, have a little snack after traveling so far.'

This is also one of their Light and Shade songs, featuring gentle acoustic guitars giving way to heavy electric guitars.

Something like that. Ramble On is also one of your Robert Plant double tracked vocal songs. You can hear it mostly at the end, it's like there are two Roberts singing, separate but equal.

Brian Jones on the vibraslap at the end of each opening bar, makes me think of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef calmly sizing each other up in some dusty lawless town. I never knew Brian Jones played on this, what a bittersweet discovery. Wow, Dave Mason too? Argghhh, can't believe I didn't know this...well, glad to know it now.

The story unfolds....the joker speaks to the thief about his troubles. The blues. Life is a drag. He finishes his words at 0:52 and Jimi cranks out a nice solo in solidarity. At 1:09, the thief 'kindly' speaks. He can sympathize and says there are 'many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.' But he says, let's not talk about this tonight, it's getting late.

1:43 - so the joker and thief wander off into the night, Jimi blazing a trail for them to follow. At 2:00 they fall asleep and are swept off into some sort of dream land (my favorite part). At 2:17 they wake from their slumber and realize they aren't quite sure where they are. A wah wah chaos of tumbleweeds and dust encircles them as they attempt to get their situation in order. 2:33 - back on some trail, with a growing sense of urgency.

2:50 - The joker and the thief have traveled over distance and time, and now out of nowhere they approach a fortress of princes, damsels, servants, possibly various other court attendants, who may have been aware of them for awhile, observing them from the watchtower. But they are not there yet. They must deal with growling wildcats and howling winds.

She's like, 'fine, keep crushing my heart if it makes you feel better', but she still can't bring herself to leave him. It's like an anti-torch song, or more like a flame thrower song.

Turn to Stone features all the common ELO accoutrements: great hooks, magical baroque/Beatlesesque string arrangements, high falsetto harmonies, interesting synthesizers and effects. I like this one for the 13 second descending metallic fade in, the driving beat, the strings throughout, the weird middle fast spoken bit, the little 'day in the life' outro, the imagery, e.g. 'the tired streets that hide away.'

What's Going On was co-written by Renaldo 'Obie' Benson, a member of the Four Tops, Motown songwriter Al Cleveland, and Marvin Gaye. Benson had witnessed police brutality in Berkeley and was really shook up by it. He began to ask himself all sorts of questions, like why were kids being sent off to Vietnam? and why were kids being beaten at home? Marvin Gaye was asking himself, with all the problems going on in my country, how am I supposed to keep singing love songs? The song is a plea for people to talk with each other and explore alternatives to war and violence. 'For only love can conquer hate.' It's amazing to me that this song is still relevant all these years later. Will our world ever evolve to the kind of existence that everyone can enjoy?

Musically, I've always loved the drums. Marvin Gaye played a box drum accompaniment to the regular drums, producing this oversized ping pong ball quality. The saxophone opening is a classic.

45501,1301,4833,"There are so many great songs in existence, and if I had to pick one as my all time favorite, it would be Strawberry Fields Forever. It encompasses everything I love about pop music: dreamy lyrical imagery, moments of transcendent creative beauty, emotional impact, and of course certain intangibles that exist on a purely personal level. This is among the peaks of the creative union between the Beatles and George Martin. John Lennon wrote the song, but Martin added all the orchestration, spliced the tapes, mixed it all into a finished work of art.

There are a number of particular moments I love:
1) Guitar from 0:18-0:22
2) Guitar during second verse from 0:40-0:54
3) Drums from left speaker 1:00-1:10+, 1:44-2:00+, and 3:00+
4) Horn riff from 1:10-1:13, etc.
5) backward percussion after 1:26
6) double-tracked vocals from 2:27-2:32
7) Guitar from 2:58-3:00 and 3:10-3:12
8) starting at 3:35, the somewhat jarring cocktail party atmosphere with the scary siren thing that creeps back in after the initial fade out. I have a love hate deal with that part.

You look back on it all as an adult, having learned to follow the rules but laughing inside because, even though you got in trouble, those activities were often pretty fun at the time.

The music says don't even bother trying to remain still, you have no choice but to get down and boogie. Listen to Stevie, he is really enjoying himself. Listen to that walking bass line, the horns, the drums pounding away. Cool middle part at 1:30, do do do do....break it down.

The extremely funky outro lasts for the final minute plus. The horn riff repeats over and over, as Stevie makes little shouts here and there, and Nathan Watts careens all over the bass with little spasms of funky joy. The horns rise up a couple times, Stevie plays a great drum roll at 4:03.

45522,1301,2355,"If You Leave Me Now is a nostalgic trip to my childhood. It was released in 1976, when I was nine years old. I have vivid memories of hearing it during that summer, driving around in the VW Beetle with my Mom, hanging out at the public pool as it played over the loudspeakers. In a way, it is a kind of security blanket. In my mind's catalogue of songs, it shares a drawer with 'If you could read my mind.' Maybe I like soft songs with 'if' in the title? Nah...'If'' by Bread would never be allowed past security. Kick that one to the curb. That's the song that starts out with that 'wawawawawa...wawawawawa...'sound. 'If a man could throw up on a song, then why can't I throw up on it too...' hahaha.

But......I digress. IYLMN was a global smash for Chicago, hitting #1 in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands. I think it inspired every song in Air Supply's catalogue. It starts out all soft and gentle, light horns and strings, a finger cymbal. Peter Cetera busts out his high-pitched Beach Boy vocals. Nice harmonies, a soft Terry Kath acoustic guitar solo, joined by strings. The only part I don't like is around 2:00, those rising strings are totally over the top and unnecessary. And I can always do without James Pankow and his trombone, ughhh. I especially love the layered string buildup on the outro. And how about Cetera's 'Oooh, girl, just got to have you by my side' scat. OK, this is not the kind of music I typically listen to, but it's like being a Cubs fan...I can't not like this song, no matter how I try. Now, 'Hard to say I'm sorry?'

45523,1301,4592,"One of my mellow faves. As close and light as I dare get to brushing up against something like Elton John's 'Your Song' or Rita Coolidge's 'We're All Alone'. If You Could Read My Mind includes a folky air of mystic dreaminess and presents a romantic honesty without flying off into Sapland. The music is pretty subdued, nice acoustic guitars and the use of one of my favorite techniques, the gently rising, unobtrusive string arrangement. Then there's Gord's voice, so soft and comfortable, like a perfectly worn baseball mitt. I also like that the lyrics don't always rhyme in the places where you think they should. It's a Dear Jane letter, the writer trying to explain why he is no longer in love, and having a hard time understanding it himself. Lots of cool images - a ghost from a wishing well, a fortress strong, a paperback novel from the drugstore, an old-time movie.

The lyrics are sung by four band members simultaneously. They sound awesome on the chorus, and in little extraneous moments: 3:03, chen trench strokes, etc? at 3:08, 4:16.

I think this is the song that finally turned Sly Stone away from songs about racial harmony. He didn't think people were getting the message, plus stardom had gotten out of control. He turned further inward and away from the mainstream, took more drugs, and began to write more about more controversial subjects like racism and violence.

Lady crying because they are taking away her favorite painting: Naked Man in Pentagram. Hey Lou, how much we gettin paid to carry around the painting of the woman on fire? I dunno, Crosby. Don't touch the painting, kid.

Tom Sawyer challenged my 13 year old brain, first because the name of the song was a children's book character I knew about, but the lyrics were esoteric and spoke of ""today's Tom Sawyer"", a different one, a warrior, with 'mean mean pride.'

The TV had advertised a record called Muskrat Love, which had this song plus many other popular songs of the time, like Rubberband Man, Nadia's Theme, Theme from Airport '76, Car Wash, Boogie Fever, Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word. Some real tepid stuff. Unfortunately, what I failed to understand about Muskrat Love from the commercial, was that these songs were not the original artist recordings. They were covers that sounded very close to the originals but not quite. I think my Mom tried to explain this to me before she helped me send $3.99 to some PO box in Michigan, but I probably didn't understand. After waiting 4-6 weeks for delivery, which is a lifetime to a nine year old, the album arrived and I eagerly placed it on the turntable. Right away, I knew something was amiss. More Than A Feeling sounded weird. I still listened to the album, but soon soured on it and eventually tossed it in the creek across from our house. I was disappointed, flabbergasted. How could someone be allowed to sell crap like this? Apparently, Canadians were spared this monstrosity.

I finally heard the actual Boston album years later, I heard the real More Than A Feeling. And Peace of Mind. And Foreplay/Long Time. As my brother would say, may your birthday be as cool as side one of Boston's first album. It is a great side. Side Two is good also, but I never cared for Something About You and Let Me Take You Home Tonight (Mama now it's all right). By the way, when did guys start referring to women as 'mama', and when did it end? Was it just a hippie thing?

Later on in life, I heard Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, and noticed that the chord structure was very similar to More Than A Feeling, albeit an angrier angst-ridden 90s yin to Boston's happy 70s yang. The guitar solo in More Than A Feeling is like taking a dose of serotonin. It sends joy and pleasure right into your bloodstream.",rememb hear feel saturday morn fall 1976 station wagon mom drove gymnast class like song much caus make first worst mail order record purchas tv advertis record call muskrat love song plu mani popular song time like rubberband man nadia theme theme airport 76 car wash boogi fever sorri seem hardest word real tepid stuff unfortun fail understand muskrat love commerci song origin artist record cover sound close origin quit think mom tri explain help send 399 po box michigan probabl didnt understand wait 46 week deliveri lifetim nine year old album arriv eagerli place turntabl right away knew someth amiss feel sound weird still listen album soon sour eventu toss creek across hous disappoint flabbergast could someon allow sell crap like appar canadian spare monstros final heard actual boston album year later heard real feel peac mind foreplaylong time brother would say may birthday cool side one boston first album great side side two good also never care someth let take,1497139200,5

Cheap Sunglasses rocks, and it's hilariously ridiculous too. A humorous ode to eyewear. The first verse is about acquiring cheap sunglasses, the second verse is about stalking a woman who is wearing cheap sunglasses, and the third verse is also about acquiring cheap sunglasses. If there is a chorus, it's Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah.

Instrumentally, there is the prominent use of a Planet N keyboard, heard in the halting breaks at 0:37, 1:05 and 3:21, at the end of each verse/chorus. At 1:06 and 1:50, you get the keyboard and this funny woo-woo-woo alarm sound. Perhaps that's the police coming after the stalker, or a signal that if you currently are not wearing your sunglasses, now is the time to don them and keep your head down. There are some great guitar solos as well, starting at 1:26 and again at 2:10, displaying some excellent distortion and harmonics. Billy Gibbons rocks! Finally, at 3:23, they slow things down for a nice bluesy outro.

Larry Knechtel, a member of the Wrecking Crew, plays piano. It was inspired by a song from the gospel group the Swan Silvertones. It has been covered by such artists as Aretha Franklin and Elvis Presley. Simon began working on it in the same house George Harrison sang about on the Beatles' Blue Jay Way.

It is a song of comfort and solidarity, it has a light in the darkness quality, no matter how low you feel I'm on your side. The piano gives it the feel of some sort of old hymn that has been around forever. Towards the end, the duo sing in harmony on the Sail on silver girl part, and the drums gain strength on see how they shine.  Angelic strings carry it away to the horizon.

45586,1301,1799,"Imagine Black Dog without those opening five seconds, or the whole Led Zeppelin IV album for that matter. Jimmy Page called it ""waking up the army of guitars."" It also prevents Robert Plant from sneaking up on us - we are ready when his voice bursts out of the speakers. The song is about a lustful old black Labrador Retriever that lived near Headley Grange during the recording sessions.

The precision of the music is indeed reminiscent of a military close-order drill. The main riff, written by John Paul Jones, represents the guitar army, layers of them, marching together, inspiring awe and respect. They even create a brass timbre somehow, at least to my ears. The call and response pattern lasts until 0:42, when the riff gets twisted up and discombobulated before righting itself at 0:52 as we head into the oh yeah break. Jimmy plays some nifty descending runs and we head into the second verse: I gotta roll can't stand still got a flamin heart can't get my fill.

At 1:27 we get a calming set of ah ah ah etc from Robert, but then at 1:38 John Bonham's drums explode with awesome power. This is a tremendously exciting moment, one of my favorites of any song. The levels are perfect: attack, loudness, reverb, emotional effect. Whoa. It takes us into another new part, the hey baby whoa baby I-don't-wear-pants-and-I'm-a-lecherous-black-dog part. This goes on until 2:04.

The song cycles back through the basic layout once more, adding a sweet guitar double helix at 3:07. Finally, at 3:37, the general of the guitar army proudly shows off the skills of improvised battle strategy, as the troops continue their parade with no signs of tiring.",imagin black dog without open five second whole led zeppelin iv album matter jimmi page call wake armi guitar also prevent robert plant sneak u readi voic burst speaker song lust old black labrador retriev live near headley grang record session precis music inde reminisc militari closeord drill main riff written john paul jone repres guitar armi layer march togeth inspir awe respect even creat brass timbr somehow least ear call respons pattern last 042 riff get twist discombobul right 052 head oh yeah break jimmi play nifti descend run head second vers gotta roll cant stand still got flamin heart cant get fill 127 get calm set ah ah ah etc robert 138 john bonham drum explod awesom power tremend excit moment one favorit song level perfect attack loud reverb emot effect whoa take u anoth new part hey babi whoa babi idontwearpantsandimalecherousblackdog part goe 204 song cycl back basic layout ad sweet guitar doubl helix 307 final 337 gener guitar armi proudli show skill improvis battl strategi troop continu parad sign tire,1497225600,5
45587,1301,264,"There are exhilarating rock intros out there, like The Faces' Stay With Me, Iggy Pop's Lust For Life, and Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run. But I think Rush's The Spirit of Radio is the best of the bunch. The guitar riff is like my dog suddenly jumping on me in the morning, wake up and play and be happy! A big slobbery kiss at 0:04, I try to roll over but she just jumps over to that side as well, bounding all about. Finally at 0:17 I have surrendered to her will and I am up. Look out the window, turn on the coffee, eat some breakfast, get dressed, grab the leash and treats and baggies, and then at 0:42 we hit the open road for a walk.

Begin the day with a friendly voice, a companion unobtrusive...well, I can't continue with the dog analogy because at 5 in the morning her voice is loud and obnoxious, and when we are out walking in the neighborhood she can occasionally be quite obtrusive. However, she is a very friendly companion.

The Spirit of Radio is about...drum roll...radio! The joy and beauty of music coming through the speakers, dancing around you on the airwaves, undemanding contact in your happy solitude. At 1:24, bass drum pounds and the first guitar riff returns, and another lyrical section about...the radio! Isn't it amazing! A gift beyond price. We can't see the airwaves, but we pick up on the sounds entering our ears, our bright antennae bristle with the energy, and the translation through our minds produces emotional feedback.

Of course, although one likes to believe in the freedom of music, radio is a business, and there are glittering prizes and endless compromises going on behind the scenes that shatter the illusion of integrity, yeah.

Check out that tumbling down moment at 3:36, it's the exasperation of dealing with the radio executive, the schmoozing DJ, the Biz. But Rush pick themselves up for an introspective moment: For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall. They record the music and radio helps sell their albums, and the band members makes their livings this way, so buck up and deal with it. Did they think adding a reggae groove would help? Well, it didn't. This whole discussion of radio has made them bitter and reflective, so they decide to release their emotions with a sizzling guitar solo that extends out into their listeners' brains and by the end everyone is happy. And now, a thousand words from our sponsors, followed by a 90 minute classic rock music marathon, and we will only play songs you've already heard a zillion times because if you hear anything unfamiliar it might be considered obtrusive and we'd get in trouble with the FCC.",exhilar rock intro like face stay iggi pop lust life bruce springsteen born run think rush spirit radio best bunch guitar riff like dog suddenli jump morn wake play happi big slobberi kiss 004 tri roll jump side well bound final 017 surrend look window turn coffe eat breakfast get dress grab leash treat baggi 042 hit open road walk begin day friendli voic companion unobtrusivewel cant continu dog analog 5 morn voic loud obnoxi walk neighborhood occasion quit obtrus howev friendli companion spirit radio aboutdrum rollradio joy beauti music come speaker danc around airwav undemand contact happi solitud 124 bass drum pound first guitar riff return anoth lyric section aboutth radio isnt amaz gift beyond price cant see airwav pick sound enter ear bright antenna bristl energi translat mind produc emot feedback cours although one like believ freedom music radio busi glitter prize endless compromis go behind scene shatter illus integr yeah check,1497225600,5

45596,1301,900,"I remember hearing Fool in the Rain on the radio in 1980 and calling the radio station to find out what it was. I wasn't too familiar with Led Zeppelin yet, so I was later surprised at how poppy this song was compared to stuff like Whole Lotta Love. The middle samba section is fun, but the best part of the song is the awesome drum fill that comes out of it at 3:44. I get fixated on it sometimes and have to rewind and listen to it multiple times. Jimmy's guitar solo after the break is also one I like a lot. It's a bit sloppy, but so is standing in the rain.

Fool in the Rain is Robert Plant channeling his inner Elvis Presley and Bill Murray's Nick the Lounge Singer. He sings like he's suavely strolling on a Vegas stage with a glass in his hand...Well there's a light in your eye that keeps shinin' (thayouverymuch), like an ol star that can't wait for the night (you know what I'm talkin about), somebody get me a scotch and tonic, it's gonna be a long night, hrumph.

45608,1301,2402,"Elegantly produced by Alan Parsons, Al Stewart's Year of the Cat is a classic of smooth 70s light rock. It's like going to bed on a warm summer night as a breeze blows lightly through the curtains. Like snuggling on a soft giant papasan chair in 1976 and having this on eight-track. Like buttah. No rough spots whatsoever; even the heavier guitar solo is balanced by strings to maintain the equilibrium.

If it were some sappy 70s love song I wouldn't like it. It's romantic, yes, but also esoteric and cool, like a Bogart movie. A tourist arrives in a town and meets a mysterious woman. He spends the night with her and in the morning realizes that he has been left behind by his tour group so he is stuck there. No big deal to him, he's carefree and open. Any way the wind blows....

It has some of my favorite lyrics of any song, especially:

She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain

Gives me goosebumps sometimes when I hear that.

Also, you go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a crime. I had no idea who Peter Lorre was for a long time, but I knew his voice from cartoons. Eventually I saw him in Casablanca. He was also incredible in M.

She comes in incense and patchouli. Nowadays, whenever I hear the word patchouli I imagine John Cusack telling Tim Robbins to get his 'patchouli stink outta my store' in High Fidelity. Great film for music geeks.

45690,6669,2330,"This is a decent mp3 set of various works by Tchaikovsky, heavy on works for orchestra. The best parts here are the less frequently heard works, such as the Orchestral Suites 2 & 4, the Piano Trio in A minor, The Seasons, the Danish Festival Overture and others. The version of the Manfred Symphony is really good, and it has been for a long time one of my favorite lesser known Tchaikovsky works. However, on the down side, the more familiar pieces in this set just do not seem to be very good performances. The numbered symphonies all sound bland and lifeless.(BTW-where is the Symphony No. 3, the Polish? You can't put in every symphony, including the Manfred, and leave out one of the earlier ones.) The piano and violin concertos also sound barely decent. The ballets are a strange mixture. You get the complete Nutcracker, (though split up over several tracks in a very frustrating way) seven or eight pieces from Swan Lake, and a single excerpt from Sleeping Beauty. What's up with that? The suite from each one would have sufficed, if that's how they were going to do it. The chamber pieces were decent, though it would have been nice to see the sextet version of Souvenier de Florence instead of the string orchestra version. And the piano pieces were barely noticed.
  Overall, if you are a newbie to Tchaikovsky and aren't too picky on the quality of the performances, you might want to try this out. At 99 cents it's not terrible. But if not, then just cherry pick this set for the Manfred and the Orchestral Suites. Plus the Piano Trio. -------------PEACE",decent mp3 set variou work tchaikovski heavi work orchestra best part le frequent heard work orchestr suit 2 4 piano trio minor season danish festiv overtur other version manfr symphoni realli good long time one favorit lesser known tchaikovski work howev side familiar piec set seem good perform number symphoni sound bland lifelessbtwwher symphoni 3 polish cant put everi symphoni includ manfr leav one earlier one piano violin concerto also sound bare decent ballet strang mixtur get complet nutcrack though split sever track frustrat way seven eight piec swan lake singl excerpt sleep beauti what suit one would suffic that go chamber piec decent though would nice see sextet version souveni de florenc instead string orchestra version piano piec bare notic overal newbi tchaikovski arent picki qualiti perform might want tri 99 cent terribl cherri pick set manfr orchestr suit plu piano trio peac,1497571200,3

Roger Waters first solo album in twenty five years is better than it has any right to be. The production is really strong, all the performances are good, and it's nice to see that Waters hasn't mellowed any in the past two decades (if anything he is more misanthropic and angry). Not all of the songs here take hold quite as they should but everything does work as a piece. And if this isn't his best work that isn't a terribly surprising thing considering this man is behind some of the greatest rock and roll records of all time.

Vox recordings from that era were typically a bit tinny, probably because they thought nothing of putting 30 minutes of music on one side of an LP.  Most of these recordings are better than that, but some are lacking.  The performances are a bit more schmaltzy and slower in tempo than the more recent recordings of Rachmaninoff I've heard.  The Symphonic Dances are my favorite among these recordings.  Pretty good, but there are other recordings of S R's work that I prefer.

45841,1301,3474,"I was thinking about the scene in the Oliver Stone film where Robby Krieger plays Light My Fire on  guitar for the rest of the group. Krieger wrote most of the song, including the first verse and chorus. Jim Morrison wrote the verse that contained wallow in the mire and love become a funeral pyre. This is according to The Doors FAQ book.

The song opens with the crack of a drum followed by some baroque-esque keyboard from Ray Manzarek. The lyrics are bookends for the vast instrumental middle section that begins at 1:07 and lasts until 5:42 (about 65% of the song).

I like the little chord twist that happens after the second Come on baby light my fire, at 0:32. A relative of the piano chord change in Imagine. As far as the instrumental section goes, I enjoy the keyboard stuff but I am really into Robby's guitar. It comes in at 3:18 and has all kinds of cascading lines up and down the neck and interesting modal sequences. John Densmore's drums have some great moments of their own, little fills here and there, keeping it all grooving along.

It's a classic song, covered by many artists including Jose Feliciano, Shirley Bassey and Stevie Wonder.",think scene oliv stone film robbi krieger play light fire guitar rest group krieger wrote song includ first vers choru jim morrison wrote vers contain wallow mire love becom funer pyre accord door faq book song open crack drum follow baroqueesqu keyboard ray manzarek lyric bookend vast instrument middl section begin 107 last 542 65 song like littl chord twist happen second come babi light fire 032 rel piano chord chang imagin far instrument section goe enjoy keyboard stuff realli robbi guitar come 318 kind cascad line neck interest modal sequenc john densmor drum great moment littl fill keep groov along classic song cover mani artist includ jose feliciano shirley bassey stevi wonder,1498176000,5

1) an episode from The Wonder Years when Kevin and Paul are hanging out in the woods with a 'bad' kid.

2) riding in the church van to Moody Bible Institute in Chicago on a stormy night in 1979 and hearing this song on the radio, along with Bad Co's Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy and Robert Palmer's Bad Case of Loving You...why do I remember these details? beats me.

3) Old Mother Hubbard...like a dog without a bone.

4) The song Ghost Riders in the Sky...Jim Morrison's whispered vocals are the ghosts.

5) The Bugs Bunny cartoon called Hare Way to the Stars, the part from 4:00-4:15 when Bugs makes the green bird martian mimic him is like the end of Riders On the Storm from about 4:35-4:45, the keyboard and guitar having a similar exchange.

45850,1301,450,"When I was young, Nights in White Satin gave me more late night heebie-jeebies than any other song, with the possible exception of Gary Wright's 'Dream Weaver'. My Zenith clock radio with its glowing numbers would be the only light in my bedroom, and I would imagine all sorts of ghosts lurking in the corners or hanging around outside among the trees. A truly haunting, lonely piece of music.

It starts off quietly, with a flute and some strings and light glockenspiel or something. Then the gently strummed acoustic guitar and drums come in, followed by Justin Hayward's mournful vocals. An eerie mellotron enters the mix at 0:42. I love the mellotron, but wow, what a creepy sound. At 1:06 we get our first dose of the crying angel voices, time to grab my pillow and stick my head under the covers. Imagine Scrooge hearing those at the stroke of midnight. Yikes!

Another pass through verse and chorus and crying angels, then at 2:18 a big smack of the drum and we head into a gloomy flute solo, accompanied by acoustic guitar and more sad mellotron.

The night passes on, the moon drifts in the sky, the stars twinkle, clouds pass by, but the narrator does not sleep. He is suffering through the night, having many 'what does it all mean' thoughts: just what the truth is, I can't say anymore. The orchestra cranks it up at 3:50, the crying angels continue to torment us. At 4:35 the orchestra surrounds us with a wall of strings and horns as the narrator rolls around in bed, unable to shake free of doom and madness. At 4:57 we are allowed a brief moment of peace before it all shatters at 5:20 in piercing strings and alarmed horns. It is all too much, and the narrator soon loses consciousness.

At 5:38 he enters a dream state. There is a brief instant of silence, then the voice of Mike Pinder startles us at 5:54 with the spoken 'Late Lament': Breathe deep, the gathering gloom, watch lights fade from every room...this part would freak me out to no end. I love to imitate the British accent: cold hearted orb that rules the night. After this section, the strings and horns ascend to rage against the impending dawn, making one final stab at 7:00. The final gong at 7:07 signifies the appearance of the sun, and the long scary night is thankfully over.",young night white satin gave late night heebiejeebi song possibl except gari wright dream weaver zenith clock radio glow number would light bedroom would imagin sort ghost lurk corner hang around outsid among tree truli haunt lone piec music start quietli flute string light glockenspiel someth gentli strum acoust guitar drum come follow justin hayward mourn vocal eeri mellotron enter mix 042 love mellotron wow creepi sound 106 get first dose cri angel voic time grab pillow stick head cover imagin scroog hear stroke midnight yike anoth pas vers choru cri angel 218 big smack drum head gloomi flute solo accompani acoust guitar sad mellotron night pas moon drift sky star twinkl cloud pas narrat sleep suffer night mani mean thought truth cant say anymor orchestra crank 350 cri angel continu torment u 435 orchestra surround u wall string horn narrat roll around bed unabl shake free doom mad 457 allow brief moment peac shatter 520 pierc string alarm horn much,1498176000,5

45852,1301,4345,"Consider the opening 0:51 of War Pigs. It explodes like a bomb hitting the ground in one of those WWII aerial films - simultaneous heavy guitar, bass and cymbal crash. While the chord sustains, a few more bombs are seen falling beneath us, through a grey sky towards a black and white city below. Listen to the guitar at 0:07, this kind of hammered-on note an octave above the root. It is like the sudden moment of impact, with the waves of destruction rippling outward. Away to the west, tanks crawl slowly across farm fields, prepared to blow away anything in their way. At 0:31 a warning siren in a nearby town calls for everyone to evacuate.

At 0:52 the pace quickens with sharp stabbing chords and pulse-quickening hi-hat. Ozzy Osbourne begins to sing at 1:03:

Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses (or my preference, 'smell each other's stinky asses')

I like the double meaning of 'mass'. Similar to 'please please me' by The Beatles. The rest of Geezer Butler's lyrics are good, and it's a great anti-war song but, you know what? I've never liked Ozzy's voice all that much. That's all I'm going to say about it.

Tony Iommi plays fantastic guitar throughout: those triplets at 1:29, the trill at 1:34, the descending chords at 1:48, the little bend at 1:50, the chug and slash part from 2:08-2:17 and the riffs that accompany Politicians hide themselves away. Beginning at 3:30 he plays several solos that overlap until around 4:20. I love those pitch bends from 4:13-4:18. A very clever guitarist.

Bill Ward plays excellent drum fills everywhere, particularly at 1:38, 1:52, 1:57, 2:02 and on and on, through Iommi's solo, and 5:28-5:30. Geezer Butler holds it all down with his mighty bass playing.

The final 2:12 is a section called 'Luke's Wall'. It's a pretty cool way to end the song. Some great drums in this part, too. And bonus for me: no Ozzy.",consid open 051 war pig explod like bomb hit ground one wwii aerial film simultan heavi guitar bass cymbal crash chord sustain bomb seen fall beneath u grey sky toward black white citi listen guitar 007 kind hammeredon note octav root like sudden moment impact wave destruct rippl outward away west tank crawl slowli across farm field prepar blow away anyth way 031 warn siren nearbi town call everyon evacu 052 pace quicken sharp stab chord pulsequicken hihat ozzi osbourn begin sing 103 gener gather mass like witch black mass prefer smell other stinki as like doubl mean mass similar plea plea beatl rest geezer butler lyric good great antiwar song know ive never like ozzi voic much that im go say toni iommi play fantast guitar throughout triplet 129 trill 134 descend chord 148 littl bend 150 chug slash part 208217 riff accompani politician hide away begin 330 play sever solo overlap around 420 love pitch bend 413418 clever guitarist bill ward play excel drum fill everywher particularli 138 152 157 202 iommi solo 528530 geezer butler hold mighti bass play,1498176000,5

45878,1301,369,"Kashmir is an undisputed classic. The band members themselves have acknowledged that this song best expressed their vision.

It opens with a crash of cymbal with a waltzing 3/4 string/guitar progression accompanied by a 4/4 drum pattern. It's what makes the song so interesting, this confluence of different time streams. Keeps things slightly tipsy. Personally, I cannot hear the opening of Kashmir without also being aware of the ending of Trampled Underfoot, the song that precedes it on the album. It is a fleeting moment, but it's there in my brain.

My favorite part of the song is the minimalist section that lasts from 2:18-3:14; there is so much breathing room in it, Bonham's drums combined with the bass and the descending string slides. Very seductive.

Kashmir has a circular theme that rotates around its axis with precision, sections linking up with each other like clockwork. Nice flanging and phasing here and there, mostly on the drum flurries; e.g., 7:50.

Most fans probably know the scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High when Ratner is instructed by Damone to play side one of Led Zeppelin IV, but he 'messes up' by playing Physical Graffiti instead. We all know that any Zeppelin album would make a good choice. Well, maybe not side two of In Through the Out Door.

45912,123,5914,"At this point you can't pretend that you bought a Roger Waters' album without knowing what to expect. You know he's going to critically examine war, politics, politicians, policies, and societal ills. This is something he has been doing in earnest since 1973's ""Dark Side of the Moon"". Same goes for making 'concept' albums, which ""Is This the Life We Really Want?"" (ITTLWRW) clearly is.

So, does 73 year old Waters have something fresh and new to say? No, but he is one of only a handful of musicians willing to continually comment on the current state of affairs, and for that, he immediately earns two stars. The trouble with Waters solo work is that it has lacked the musicianship from the rest of the Pink Floyd camp. Someone once said that Roger Waters was Pink Floyd's conscience, it's vision, it's lyrical poetry, whilst Gilmour, Wright and Mason were the architects, sound designers, and heart behind Waters' words. Nowhere is that more apparent that on ITTLWRW--the lyrics are spot on, but musically....well....the album is just so-so. Musically, there are no inspired moments, no innovative curves, no surprises sonically. So, after several listens, the music isn't all that memorable while what Waters is talking about resonates long after the music ends.

I'm not entirely certain as to why Waters felt the need after 25 years of silence to comment once more on current affairs. He pretty much addressed everything that needed addressing with 1992's ""Amused to Death"", or 1979's ""The Wall"" or 1977's ""Animals"". I want to be extremely clear here--I side with Waters' point of view, but that point of view isn't as effectively showcased with the music presented on ITTLWRW. I don't mind at all that Waters is a realist, a cynic, a pessimist, or what you will. I side with that view. He just should have brought the music to go with it this time, and he didn't. For that, I can't give this work five stars, or even four stars. It falls somewhere between three and three and a half stars for me.

That being said, I have to say that the final trilogy of songs here are some of Waters' most moving of his career--""Wait for Her"", ""Oceans Apart"", and ""A Part of Me Died"". Those, along with ""Broken Bones"" are my favorites here. They just aren't enough to push this album above three stars.

This very well could be the first and last time I write a critique on Roger Waters and/or Pink Floyd as it seems there may be nothing that follows in the future. I am not a big David Gilmour solo work fan, and so I will take this final opportunity to compare this current work with Roger Waters' and Pink Floyd's previous works.

45917,1662,5914,"Everyone is complaining about the political views and negative lyrics.  Since when did Roger Waters not speak of what was on his mind?  Roger has always had lots to say and was not afraid to put it to music.  Lets talk about the music here, 54 minutes of some really outstanding songs.

We need to remember this man made up 25%  of one of the greatest musical groups of our generation!  Pink Floyd, there has never been a group that is in the same league as these guys were and there never will be!

Roger Waters is like a fine wine, he gets better with age.  The sound effects, and all of the voices and talking between the songs is so Pink Floyd.  The  music flows in a very dreamy,  Pink Floyd style.  In June 2017 it almost seems like I am listening to a brand new Floyd release!  However, I do miss  David Gilmour's  signature guitar sounds!

If you are a fan of Roger Waters or of Pink Floyd you need to buy this at once!  This is great music to enjoy,  I cannot stop listening to it, very addicting!  There will be no Pink Floyd reunion soon, Roger Waters or David Gilmour solo releases are all were gonna get so enjoy!!

RUN DMC brings us back to the saner times of the 1980's (Yeah. That's a sentence I just said.) Their greatest hits just reminds me of all that was fun about when I was a kid. And as I'm blasting this now in my own house that I pay the mortgage on I can almost hear my mother still banging on the door telling me to 'turn that junk down!'

The sound quality on the streaming version of this is pretty good. Since its' mostly rap with the instrumentation being a background sound any loss of fidelity is totally acceptable to me on a streaming version. But even then it still sounds strong and natural via streaming. And Steven Tyler sounds great on the Walk This Way collaboration.

46026,6277,4646,"This is a seriously cool sounding song!  The first time I heard it was last night though.  My husband and I were talking about my two pairs of pants I bought this week for church, and I told him I was totally going for the more pant like set first because darn it, I've read the scriptures (read them daily even) and there's nowhere in them that says ""Woman, thou shalt only wear skirts to church.""  But it's become such an ingrained part of the social metaphorical yardstick of faithfulness people like to measure you against in our church that despite what people see me doing every week with our son, it's going to be seen as scandalous to the point of heresy by some when I show up this Sunday...and I don't think it should be that way.  I think we should just love people, because loving them works a lot better and feels a lot better then judging them. But that's just my opinion on the subject.

And probably most people won't say anything to my face, but experience has taught me the rat-a-tat-tat of the firing squad will probably be making the rounds behind my back.  And as we were talking about this, my husband said, ""So you're like the color of boom.""  And I said, ""Que?"" because I'd totally never heard this song, and then I quipped, ""no, I'm more like the color of ka-boom""  As in fireworks, because I'm not just loud, I'm also glittery and sparkly all at the same time ;)  And he said, no babe, you totally have to listen to this song (because he'd had it on prime music on his phone) because this sounds like you...and I just laughed as I listened, because he's totally right.  And then I bought the song.

I realize the lyrics can have some different interpretations, but I think it also speaks a lot towards people who feel like they might just be out of sync with the people around them because maybe they're the neon color in the box of primary and secondary colored crayons.  Or the one with glitter and sparkles. And maybe like me, they have trouble coloring in the lines, but their heart is in the best possible places, right?  So I love this song, totally love it, and it made my day better.  And I'm going to be struggling to be singing hymns in my head and not this song when I walk through the doors on Sunday.  But I'll try to be good, because I usually do, in the biblical sense anyways ;)",serious cool sound song first time heard last night though husband talk two pair pant bought week church told total go pant like set first darn ive read scriptur read daili even there nowher say woman thou shalt wear skirt church becom ingrain part social metaphor yardstick faith peopl like measur church despit peopl see everi week son go seen scandal point heresi show sundayand dont think way think love peopl love work lot better feel lot better judg that opinion subject probabl peopl wont say anyth face experi taught ratatattat fire squad probabl make round behind back talk husband said your like color boom said que id total never heard song quip im like color kaboom firework im loud im also glitteri sparkli time said babe total listen song hed prime music phone sound like youand laugh listen he total right bought,1498780800,5

For those of you not familiar with it, Billy Jack was a renegade hero of the marginalized Indians (now Native Americans) on reservations.

I'm guessing that it comes from the fact that this song, lyrics aside is a masterfully crafted hit of a song that carries emotion to match the lyrics. It is a very angry song but at the same time, it is a very liberating song. Without saying it explicitly, the song appears to be by a man, not an American, who is jaded by a recent relationship with an American woman. Since Burton Cummings is Canadian this would be an appropriate vantage point from which he might write. If you've ever felt used and unjustly dumped, this would be your choice of angry songs.

Cons: Free, maybe All The Critics too.

1999 was Prince's first US Top Ten album. It is his fifth release, and it has gone on to sell around ten million copies worldwide. This is Prince's 1982 breakthrough album that launched him into the big time and started him on the path to super-stardom, as his mega smash Purple Rain album and movie were his next musical moves two years later in 1984.

 For this album, Prince renamed his band Prince and the Revolution in lieu of the go it alone Prince that his first four albums toted. His first four albums sold modestly well, breaking into the top 40 twice, and his singles did even worse, besides his one hit I Wanna Be Your Lover from his second album, Prince from 1979.
 On his first four albums, Prince could really only be heard singing in his soulful falsetto. The 1999 album is the first where he sings full-throated on every song.

 The opening song is the title track, 1999. The song reached a very respectable #12 in the US singles charts, and even better in the R&B and Dance singles charts. The song is kind of divided up vocally in the same way Stevie Wonder had done with You Are the Sunshine of My Life. First voice you hear is that of keyboardist, Lisa Coleman, then guitarist Dez Dickerson sings the next line, and then Prince will sing the third song. On the fourth line they will all harmonize together. The beat is a rock/dance mix set to apocalyptic lyrics about the New Year's Eve 1999, the last day we humans will be alive because of the imminent cold war destruction we face in the year 2000. Prince declares he will live life to the fullest during this last year, and especially on that fateful day of New Year's Eve. Prince's 1982 idea of living life is having sex and dancing to his own music. That ideology is the basis for the whole album actually, so this opening track makes the perfect choice for title track.

1999 quietly segues into Prince's first Top Ten hit, Little Red Corvette, reaching #6 in the US Pop singles charts. The song has crossed over into classic status. Once in a while I'll even hear it on a classic rock station. This is one of Prince's most well-known songs, his inclusion of the song in the acoustic segment of his Musicology tour was a highlight. The song is very pop rock, not really a dance song at all. The guitar solo provided by Dez is good, but not Prince caliber. When Dez left after this album, Prince mostly handled all of the guitar solos himself. Dez could be seen in Prince's first film Purple Rain performing at First Avenue.

 Prince had another top ten hit with the next song Delirious. The song reached number 8 in the US Pop singles charts. When I first heard the song, I thought it was too silly and poppy for my tastes. The song quickly grew on me, it's so much fun to sing along and tap a toe to. It's the shortest song on the album clocking in at only 4 minutes. The song has a loopy wavy keyboard riff that commands you to get silly. Even though it's silly time with Prince, the song is as addictive as any of the great songs on this album.

Let's Pretend We're Married is one of my favorites. The fast drumbeat and artificial bass is the backdrop for deliberately slow melody line sung by Prince. The song is very upbeat, poppy and happy - so the erotic lyrics are sort of camouflaged by the song's happy mood.
 Even the ""f"" word is uttered more than once in this song, but it's all in fun - in a 1982 sort of way. This was also released as a single, but it couldn't break the top 40 on any of the US singles charts, stalling at #52 in the Pop Singles charts.

Now, there's no hiding the fact that D.M.S.R. is just down right the nastiest song on the album. The song has a deep and raw bass and bass synthesizer that crank up the funk factor to 11. The keyboards and guitars accent the bass and lyrics masterfully. The song is a dance party, and the fact that the song lasts over eight minutes it will last for a good part of it. The lyrics demand participation...

 It took me a while to buy the CD for 1999, even though it is such a great album. I held on to my double vinyl album for a while because the single CD released was missing a song, D.M.S.R., because CDs were only 75 minutes back then. When CDs were manufactured with a slightly longer running time at 80 minutes, 1999 was re-released. I always wondered who was the genius who chose to leave off D.M.S.R. instead of a lesser song.

 Speaking of lesser songs, Free is thrown into the middle of the album song list, and it really destroys the whole idea that this is a perfect album. It's not the song is awful; it's just not good enough to be appreciated amongst the rest of the other songs. It's a piano ballad, and it has a couple of slight hooks, but it just doesn't work. This is a smutty, sexual dance, rock funk album, and Free just doesn't go with that flow.

 Speaking of smutty sex songs, Automatic is one of the best. The lyrics are what do it for me, they're honest and bare. They talk about raw feelings about obsession, lust and desperation.  The song runs almost ten minutes long, it's hypnotically amazing, and sometimes it seems too short, believe it or not. The song has an intoxicatingly beat that refuses to deviate, but the melody on top of it changes here and there throughout the song. The song has many parts, yet still with that single beat, it's a great effect. This song is epic, and is surely one of those deep cuts, those rare Prince songs that not too many people know, but if and when they stumble upon it, it's like a buried treasure filled with riches.

Automatic and Something in the Water (Does Not Compute) were always like sister songs to me. They don't sound alike, but the sexually erotic and desperate honest theme is rampant in both songs. The sixteenth note high-hat is constant, and again Prince deliberately sings at a much slower pace against the super fast high-hat. The lyrics tend to be about self-evaluation, since he is not getting the response from women he thinks he should be getting. The song has a very high emotive quality, especially in the parts where Prince screeches those amazing screams that only he can do. Lots of echo and in these two songs add to the erotic ambience of these last two songs effectively. These both are my favorite two songs on the album.

Lady Cab Driver is probably as smutty as Prince gets on this album, complete with squeaking bed sounds and all. Prince wears his falsetto voice again for the most part of this song. The Revolution delivers a very groovy and funky beat. The verses of this song sort of remind me of Tom Tom Club's first album. The story of the lyrics is about Prince hailing a taxi and at the end of the ride making love to the cab driver. While he's doing her, he spews his frustrations orally as well as sexually.

All the Critics Love U in New York is just a little bit better than Free. It's another big funk fest of bass and drums, but the melody line is uninspired and falls flat. It's too bad, because there's some real good bass playing here.

 The CD ends with International Lover. This song has a classic slow Motown type of groove, with funky smut lyrics. Prince is your pilot, and watch out when your board, because Prince is not only going to fly you to another country, but he'll rock your world. The plane is called the Seduction 747, again it sounds corny, but it works I suppose because only someone like Prince can pull a song like this off. This Prince song may have crossed the line; this is more like the Prince on Saturday Night Live portrayed by the hilarious Fred Armisen.

The album is a big dance party, yet eclectic. It rocks pretty hard when it tries, yet has some corny moments. It is the perfect predecessor for Prince's next venture which was Purple Rain. It is a new beginning after the first four albums. It's the beginning of the Prince career we all loved for a little while there in the 80s, and the snippets of genius we see even today by his recent released. It's the start of all things purple lyrically and visually. This is a great place to begin your exploration of Prince knowledge. If you need to learn about the earlier stuff, get the 1993 greatest compilation called The Hits/B-Sides, it pretty much sums it up.

Bohemian Rhapsody broke new ground in its time and is said to have been the single most song to produce at the time of its release. The song features opera chorus music and innovative choral arrangements not usually found in a Rock N Roll format. The timing is magnificent and when the electric guitars enter the scene they really cut loose with wild abandon with ferocious vocals to boot. This is a great song that I sometimes stop to appreciate. Because it got so much play, I actually avoided the song for awhile but today I find myself able to enjoy it anew.

The musicians who wrote the song, Eric Clapton and George Harrison are legends in their own right apart from Cream.  It was written for Cream's farewell album ""Goodbye.""  The concept was that each band member would write a song and this was Eric Clapton's song. Apparently, Clapton enlisted George Harrison to help him complete it but however Badge came down the pike it remains an important part of Rock N Roll history and deserves a place in any comprehensive collection.",fantast song cream 1969 made 60 billboard hot 100 musician wrote song eric clapton georg harrison legend right apart cream written cream farewel album goodby concept band member would write song eric clapton song appar clapton enlist georg harrison help complet howev badg came pike remain import part rock n roll histori deserv place comprehens collect,1499731200,5
46211,6582,5854,"Rich Girl, which was released in 1977, became Hall and Oates first number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and in a sense launched them into recognition as something a little different, sort of a pop Rhythm and Blues style into a market that was heavily going Disco and Funk. I was a senior that year and it was everywhere. Soon after that they flooded the market with ""Sarah Smile"" which all of us were humming. Love it or hate it, Hall and Oates were masters in their pop style and the music is still fun today.

Her music is evocative and passionate and soothing all at the same time.  I love the infusion of poetry in her lyrics. I haven't heard a single thing of hers I haven't loved.

46370,121,2381,"Mark Knopfler is in fine form on this recording, which is full of songs crafted to be melodic and tell a story you'll want to hear told. Lots of ""trad"" sounding ballads on this one.

A lot like the old Dire Straits in places too, if that is what you are looking for. Some quiet rockers, understated for the most part, many ballads.as I said earlier. One or two more hard-moving numbers. A couple of bluesey songs.

Knopfler is at his mournful best on many of these songs, evoking the same vocal texture as on ""Private Investigations"" and ""Brothers in Arms"", which I consider his special strength as a singer. He has matured as a songwriter, but was always gifted in that department, able to spin fascinating lyrics on almost any subject. Here he is less cryptic than he has perhaps been (notably in places on Brothers in Arms and On Every Street).

His playing is, of course, virtuoso-level and he now has passed the need to show everyone that, making for understated brilliance. There's a particular joy in listening to someone who just knows how to play a given song for best overall effect (just as there's also a joy to hearing someone who gets paid by the note a-la Steve Howe or Django Reinhardt and someone who can take control and make you forget the other band components like Jimi Hendrix). It is a matter of mood for me.

In fact the ""feel"" of Privateering is very like Brothers in Arms (the album) for much of it, and I approve. I liked the Dire Straits sound and Knopfler evokes it here much of the time.

Personal Favorites:

The first track ""Redbud Tree"", a song in a minor key with a singable refrain, about a man on the run, ""Privateering"", a delightful call to all who would go adventuring on the Spanish Main,  and ""Corned Beef City"", a rocker telling the story of a trucker just squeaking by on one-day jobs.

But this album is one of those rare birds - one which has no ""clunkers"" for me. Picking favorites from such a collection is very hard.",mark knopfler fine form record full song craft melod tell stori youll want hear told lot trad sound ballad one lot like old dire strait place look quiet rocker underst part mani balladsa said earlier one two hardmov number coupl bluesey song knopfler mourn best mani song evok vocal textur privat investig brother arm consid special strength singer matur songwrit alway gift depart abl spin fascin lyric almost subject le cryptic perhap notabl place brother arm everi street play cours virtuosolevel pas need show everyon make underst brillianc there particular joy listen someon know play given song best overal effect there also joy hear someon get paid note ala steve howe django reinhardt someon take control make forget band compon like jimi hendrix matter mood fact feel privat like brother arm album much approv like dire strait sound knopfler evok much time person favorit first track redbud tree song minor key singabl refrain man run,1500336000,5

Of her repertoire, I find ""Angel"" to be her best song -- it's emotional without being over-the-top, and has a quiet, laid-back piano accompaniment that doesn't overwhelm the singer's voice.  It's relaxing, lovely, and well worth owning as a single.

46522,6321,2026,"1971 was a very interesting time in the Beach Boys career. The counterculture that an album like ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Smiley Smile"" helped usher in was still very much alive (and would be peaking until the end of 1972ish) but the Beach Boys were only really commercially viable in Europe and especially England were their newer materially was appreciated. Their previous album ""Sunflower"" was a critical success and mostly a fantastic album but debuted at something like #190 on the US charts (still kind of shocks me). They needed Brian's name to make a push for US interest but at the same time Brian, while still musically active was the Brian of old - his ear wasn't tuned to the charts and whatever he produced was most likely going to be highly un- commercial. This point is really the crux of the issue. The Boys and especially Mike Love want Brian, but only a certain type of Brian..ie..Don't get to weird! In 1971, I think their best bet was to tell Brian; ""Brian do what you want, anything! we are behind you a 100%!"" and then market it as Brian unchained. Well that's sort of what happened, but it was fighting all along the way. ""A Day in the Life of a Tree"", ""Till I Die"" and ""Surf's Up"" are a very dark and emotially challenging music for a band that less than a decade ago was singing great songs about fun in the sun. ""A Day in the life of a Tree"" is about exacly what the title says, although one could be tempted to think it was also about Brian's state of mind at the time. Wonderfully sung by at the time manager Jack Riley (with Van Dyke Parks of Smile fan in lead background vocals towards the end) its a great song and seagues perfectally into the more famous ""Till I Die"". Carl decided to finish ""Surf's Up"" which at the time was a stroke of critical and commercial genius as calling the album ""Surf's Up"" after the famed ""Smile"" song was likely the reason why this album got into the top 30 on the US charts. It's interesting hearing this version with Carl singing lead for the first half, up to ""Dove nested towers"", when the 1966/67 Brian takes over. Now we have a complete version with Brian on lead vocals from 2011's ""The Smile Sessions"" so its lessens the impact of the version here somewhat (although it's in stereo which adds something) but I try to think of how amazing it must have sounded when the album first came out. The ""Child is the Father of the Man"" contrapuntal choral at the end is one of the all time best Beach Boy moments. It's interesting the gave Alan Jardine the lead line during the choral and he does a fantastic job of singing; ""A Children's Song..."" Which brings me to Alan Jardine's input on the album. Alan has often been in the background with the Beach Boys, simply adding to their vocal blend and some rhythm guitar/misc. instruments here and there. For their last album ""Sunflower"", Alan was hardly given any spotlight. Here he sings a funky lead vocal line on ""Don't Go Near the Water"", most of ""Take a Load Off Your Feet"", ""Looking at Tomorrow (A Welfare Song) and the aforementioned climax of ""Surf's Up"". It's quite a big step up in prescense on this album for Alan. ""Looking at Tomorrow"" in particular I find seagues perfectly between ""Feel Flows"" and ""Day in the Life of a Tree"". It's a fantastic deeply psychedelic folk song with amazing phasing/flanging all over the track. Bruce Johnston bings the amazing ""Disney Girls"" which, no matter how annoying Bruce has been over the years, or how random/pointless/dorky he seems later on, he brought this song, which is just beautiful. Carl's ""Long Promised Road"" and ""Feel Flows"" are Carl breaking out as a fanastic song write. ""Feel Flows"" with it's mystic jazz flute/guitar/sax soloing is a favorite of mine. Up to this point of the review this album is largey perfect. Sure ""Take a Load Off Your Feet"" is bizarre, and a little unsettling but there's a lot to like about the track including Brian's lead vocals starting off the song (an increasing rarity at this point) and the violin at the end. Dennis's absence on this album really takes the album down. After 4 songwriting credits on ""Sunflower"", he really became a presence on a Beach Boys album, which he had been forahwile for varying degrees at this point. When you hear ""Wouldn't it be Nice to Live Again"" from the ""Surf's Up"" sessions, I wonder ""how in the HELL was this not put on the album!!?"" it would have easily been a highlight. The album is on 34 minutes and could have used it to pad out the run time. It wasn't completed from what I've read, but listening to it on ""Made in California"" box set, I think its easily finished enough to be on the album. O yea, ""Student Demonstration Time"" which is probably Mike Love's first true WTF moment (there would be many). It's a rewrite of  ""Riot in Cell Block 9"" with new lryics from Mike Love. Mike Love's biggest moment on ""Sunflower"" was the amazing proto dream pop ""All I Wanna Do"", and on this album he really doesn't follow that mid album showcase all that well. The song was performed well enough with enough bluesy umph to make it likeable enouh has an akward lryric refrain and really sounds entirely out of place on this album or any Beach Boys album. If Dennis's had a couple songs in place or in addition to that one it would have helped. Still a legendary abum that's easy to listen to all the way through over and over again. I recommend buying the mp3 ""Wouldn't it be Nice to Live Again"" from the ""Made in California"" box set to complete the album better or to replace ""Student Demonstration Time"" depending on how you feel about the track.",1971 interest time beach boy career countercultur album like pet sound smiley smile help usher still much aliv would peak end 1972ish beach boy realli commerci viabl europ especi england newer materi appreci previou album sunflow critic success mostli fantast album debut someth like 190 u chart still kind shock need brian name make push u interest time brian still music activ brian old ear wasnt tune chart whatev produc like go highli un commerci point realli crux issu boy especi mike love want brian certain type brianiedont get weird 1971 think best bet tell brian brian want anyth behind 100 market brian unchain well that sort happen fight along way day life tree till die surf dark emoti challeng music band le decad ago sing great song fun sun day life tree exacli titl say although one could tempt think also brian state mind time wonder sung time manag jack riley van dyke park smile fan lead background vocal toward end,1500595200,4

46669,6751,3254,"At least before his arrest, Phil Spector was hailed a musical genius. True, he did produce several classic singles for the Ronettes, Crystals and Righteous Brothers that are some of the most beloved Oldies from the 60s, but he was not on par with someone like Paul McCartney or John Lennon who could craft entire concept albums that remain classics 50-plus years later.

I am not bashing Phil nor his music, just using my above statement to back up my two-star review for this CD that is only worth getting for HES A REBEL, DA DOO RON RON and THEN HE KISSED ME. The other songs on here are nowhere near as good as the three hits. Its too bad that the Crystals didn't have better material, but I feel a little of Phils sound went a long wayit only worked with the right melodies and lyrics, and the rest of whats here is lacking. I fell in love with the Crystals hits back in the early 80s and actually liked them better than the Shirelles or the Chiffons back then. But Ive heard a few of the Shirelles albums recorded in the 60s and even the deep album cuts are much better than the second-string hits found here by The Crystals.

46691,6754,2399,"I stumbled upon ""100 Must-Have Bach Masterpieces"" while browsing the digital music section at Amazon.com. I was a bit surprised to see that this MP3 album's track listing on its Amazon web page does not show the performing artists' names on well over half the listed tracks, and the few names that are shown I have never heard of before. I thought it best to give this album a ""try-before-I-buy"" listen before committing even a couple of bucks to its purchase. I am glad I did.

This may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard. The 100 tracks selected for this album are alright, although they only cover 25 different Bach compositions and therefore don't give a particularly well-rounded picture of the immense depth and breadth of Bach's incredible genius. The biggest problem, however, is the dated musicianship on the album.

Every one of the selections is played too slowly, and every performance is flat, lifeless, and dull. Allegro (quick) movements, especially in the Brandenburg Concerto, Orchestral Suite, piano concerto, and violin concerto selections, are played at a nearly Andante (moderately slow) pace, and Andante movements are played at close to a Largo (very slow) tempo.  Choral pieces fare no better. Choruses and solo vocalists, while technically competent, sing with little of the artistry  found in the best Bach recordings. I found the selections from both the ""St. Matthew Passion"" and St. John Passion"" especially lethargic and monotonous.

There are far better compilations of Bach's music that are performed by world-class musicians who infuse their performances with energy, passion, and tremendous artistry. Two such particularly praiseworthy albums are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Bach-2CDs/dp/B000W0B1CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Bach (2CDs)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-x-Bach/dp/B00P3CEUXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 x Bach</a>, both of which are highly enjoyable and very affordable.

46965,6754,1306,"Lately Ive had a great deal of success in finding large, outstanding compilations of classical music at the unbelievably low price of 99 cents. I recently acquired The Bach Guild's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box/dp/B013THM8PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Symphonies Box</a>&nbsp;from Amazon.com, and I liked it so much I decided to add another one of the Big Box albums to my digital music collection. This time I chose the Big Mozart Box. It turned out to be an inspired choice.

Big Mozart Box features nearly 14 hours of instrumental music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all for only 99 cents. This superlative MP3 album contains an extraordinarily impressive array of music from a variety of sub-genres within the oeuvre of Mozarts music. Mozart is known to have composed over 600 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his short lifetime. Over 40 of his instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Mozart Box. They include divertimenti, serenades, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, and others. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Mozarts incredibly inventive musical genius.

These are all superb performances from the mid-20th century. They feature various world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, and solo instrumentalists, all of whom demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in every performance. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Mozart infused into his music. Although these are mostly older stereophonic recordings (a few of them are monaural), the audio quality of the entire album is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.

Of all the Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I think Big Mozart Box is clearly the best. I listen to it constantly, and I am always highly entertained by it.

46988,6754,3026,"Lately Ive been having a great deal of success in finding large compilations of classical music at unbelievably low prices. Ive been reading some uniformly glowing reviews of the Big Box albums from The Bach Guild, so I decided to purchase one to see if its as good as reviewers say it is.

My first choice was the Big Haydn Symphonies Box, featuring over nine hours of Franz Joseph Haydns symphonies, for only 99 cents. This MP3 album contains a quite impressive array of music from the composer known as the father of the modern symphony. Haydn composed 104 symphonies during his long lifetime, and 24 of them appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Symphonies Box. They range from his earlier light-hearted works, through his more impassioned Sturm und Drang middle symphonies, and on to his most famous later Paris and London symphonic masterpieces.

These are all very fine performances from the 1950s through the 1970s. They feature various world-class orchestras and conductors who seem to mostly hail from eastern Europe. These ensembles may not have been as renowned as many of their more famous western counterparts, but their artistry and musicianship are undeniably every bit as good. They consistently do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama of Haydns great symphonic masterworks.

There are two unfortunate technical flaws in Big Haydn Symphonies Box that prevent me from awarding this otherwise outstanding album my full 5-star rating. There is a short but noticeable high-pitched tone at the 1:19 mark of track 13. Although its not particularly bothersome, the albums engineers should have noticed and removed it. Also, the final movement of Symphony No. 90 is incorrect. Although the tracks metadata correctly lists it as Finale: Allegro Assai, the music is actually a duplicate of the first movement of Symphony No. 91. Again, the albums engineers should have discovered and eliminated this error.

Despite these minor flaws, Big Haydn Symphonies Box is an excellent MP3 album that I enjoy listening to on a regular basis.

Musically, she is one of the greatest divas in the world, that has shown that true beauty is solely from the voice within. She showcased a amazing bravado at the heart of the matter. But overall, she died at a very young age. But if there is one thing that I have known about Whitney, is that unlike other divas of today, her voice really reached from the deepest inner soul, something that I still adore today, much more than today's divas like Rihanna or Beyonce' Knowles that are products, not people. It also is the 25th anniversary of The Bodyguard soundtrack, the biggest selling soundtrack in the world, that absolutely defined a era of the music, the 1990's. I absolutely adore all of the songs Whitney Houston performed on the soundtrack, and Run To You is absolutely no exception. The song is absolutely beautiful & soulful from Whitney's vocals, each time I hear the song. It truly is astonishing & beautiful. It really is that high of the top tier, as is the case with I Will Always Love You & any other ballad Whitney had recorded over the years. It truly is a lovely opus that is worth any listener's ear that really strikes the essence of beauty. This is one Whitney Houston song I sincerely recommend listening to.

47131,6754,2791,"My great luck in finding large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices continued earlier this week when I acquired The Bach Guild's Big Haydn Box from Amazon.com for only 99 cents. This is the fourth of The Bach Guilds Big Box albums that I have added to my digital music collection, and I think I made another inspired choice.

Big Haydn Box (not to be confused with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Symphonies-Box/dp/B013THM8PA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Symphonies Box</a>, which I have already reviewed), features over 14 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns wonderful music. It is an extraordinarily impressive array from a variety of sub-genres within Haydns oeuvre. Haydn is known to have composed over 500 works across a large spectrum of sub-genres during his lifetime. By my count, 40 of his vocal and instrumental works appear in their entirety in Big Haydn Box. They include divertimenti, symphonies, string quartets, piano sonatas, overtures, fantasies, concertos for a variety of solo instruments, masses, and an oratorio. Each clearly shows the depth and breadth of Haydns incredibly inventive musical genius.

These recordings from the mid-20th century feature various lesser-known but world-class orchestras, conductors, chamber ensembles, choirs, and solo instrumentalists and vocalists who hail mostly from eastern Europe. All of them demonstrate the highest degree of artistry and musicianship in each of their performances. They do a wonderful job of conveying the full emotional power and drama that Haydn infused into his music. I have now listened to well over half of this album and I think the audio quality of these mostly older stereophonic recordings is clean, crisp, and well-balanced.

Of the four Big Box albums I have acquired thus far, I rank Big Haydn Box right alongside&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>&nbsp;as one of the best in my digital music library.

And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time,
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line. - Jimmy Webb

Five MEMORABLE Stars. The immortal golden hit song, Wichita Lineman was written by the legendary composer Jimmy Webb and sung by Grammy-winning singer Glen Campbell. It is one of his biggest hits amid an awesome string of hits that crossed over genres to a wide audience of fans. It is a ballad about a hardworking, pole climbing technician keeping the lines up and working for the customers. The other musicians on the recording included Campbell, session orchestra arranger Al De Lory on piano; Al Casey, James Burton, and Carol Kaye on guitars; with Don Bailey on bass, Jim Gordon on drums and a string section.

In the performance, Campbell uses his acclaimed distinctive voice, vocal sincerity and role-projection ability, as well as his guitar musicianship. The excellent arrangement of the strings is by pianist De Lory. Built upon a loping beat and backed primarily by guitars and ethereal strings with reeds and a piccolo imitating morse code. In the song, the linemans focus shifts between technicalities and problems of his job, amid his intruding thoughts about a woman that he wants and needs. Actually, Webb wrote the song inspired by driving alongside miles and miles of lines and telephone poles and seeing one solitary lineman technician in the middle of nowhere working on top of a pole, all by himself. Webb was reportedly also inspired by a failed romance. This is yet another great Glen Campbell performance that paints an indelible musical scene. My Highest Recommendation. Five FABULOUS Stars.

While Buffalo Springfield wasn't around very long during their brief stint together they made some great music including ""For What It's Worth"",their most well known song. It has that classic folk-rock sound that was at its height during the mid-60s. Thought provoking lyrics that are in many ways still relevant today 50+ years later.

47226,6798,5038,"Released in 2016, XI is Metal Church's eleventh album (naturally), marking the return of second frontman Mike Howe after 23 years absence. XI is their fourth album with Howe, which means both Howe and Munroe are tied with four studio albums each. Original singer David Wayne did three, but since he released his own METAL CHURCH album in 2001 and it was originally slated to BE a Metal Church album (until Vanderhoof changed his mind), he arguably did four as well.

To be expected, XI sounds like the four previous Ronny Munroe albums, except with Howe singing. Whether you prefer Munroe or Howe is a matter of personal taste. I like 'em both but don't love 'em; neither possesses Wayne's special appeal IMHO, e.g. his moving falsetto. However, if backed up against a wall concerning Munroe and Howe, I'd probably pick Munroe because he's closer to Wayne's style. That said, Howe's certainly stalwart & passionate and can really nail a song, like ""Fake Healer.""

So what about XI? It's a solid Metal Church album that will grow on you, like the five previous Metal Church releases. While it doesn't contain anything of the caliber of ""Watch the Children Pray,"" ""Fake Healer"" or ""Beyond the Black,"" it nevertheless has a few tracks that stand out, like the melancholic-but-compelling ""No Tomorrow"" and the driving ""Killing Your time,"" both of which were advance releases. The kinetic/proggy opener ""Reset"" was also released in advance as a video a week before the album's debut.

The punchy closing song ""Suffer Fools"" is one of the best while the mysterious & groovin' ""Needle & Suture"" is one of my favorites. Most of the songs are embellished with eerie, atmospheric parts with some whole tracks having that vibe, like ""Sky Falls In"" and ""It Waits."" There are also some interesting experimental ditties or parts, like ""Shadow."" Howe sounds like he never left.

47310,6754,4777,"In my quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Box/dp/B00CMAM8QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Box</a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.

I recently added Bigger Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the second of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including a comprehensive offering of his piano sonatas, his only violin concerto, his complete Diabelli variations and piano concertos, four of his nine symphonies, as well as dances, songs, rondos, bagatelles, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.

Although I think Bigger Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I am slightly less enamored of it. This is mainly due to two reasons:

1. There are no string quartets or piano trios on ""Bigger Beethoven Box."" Many of Beethovens greatest chamber music masterpieces belong to these two sub-genres, and I think the fact that  none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.

2. The albums engineering is not quite as good as it is on other Big Box albums  especially Big Mozart Box and Big Haydn Box. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.

Despite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience.

47416,6754,351,"Last week I found another phenomenal classical music bargain at Amazon.com: Haydn: Complete String Quartets on the VoxBox label. Featuring the Dekany Quartet and the Fine Arts Quartet, this splendid MP3 album contains nearly 24 hours of Franz Joseph Haydns string quartets, all brilliantly performed by the two ensembles mentioned above.

This MP3 VoxMegaBox Edition contains all of the string quartets in Haydns oeuvre, including some that are credited to him that he may not have composed. The works are placed in opus number order, from earliest to latest, so listeners can hear the progression of Haydns musical thinking and development over his many decades of composing in this genre.

The Dekany Quartet plays just over half of the 70-plus works that appear on this album, and the Fine Arts Quartet plays the remainder. The musicianship of these two ensembles is exquisite throughout. They consistently engage their instruments in those finely balanced musical conversations that make well-played string quartets such a joyful listening experience for me. Their interpretations are flawless, showing every bit of the emotion and intellect that Haydn wrote into each one of his chamber music masterworks. There are some subtle differences between the two ensembles in tone, texture, and color, but overall, I find it difficult to tell them apart.

The audio quality on Haydn: Complete String Quartets is crisp, clean, and precise. My ears can easily detect each of the four lines playing in every string quartet. On rare occasions, the first violin sounds a trifle over-bright, but this in no way detracts from my overall listening pleasure.

When Haydn: Complete String Quartets first came out at Amazon.com in 2015, it apparently sold for $2.99  an extraordinary bargain. Now, even at over three times that price ($9.49), I think it remains one of the best classical music values to be found anywhere. Its low price, combined with its exquisite performances and exceptional audio quality, makes it a must-have in every digital classical music library.

Anyways, great, rock album. Big fan of Matt Helders, the drummer from the amazing Arctic Monkeys, and although I'm not a fan of Josh Homme's Queens of the Stone Age Band, his instrument playing and production on this album is very admirable. The best way I can describe it is if you took the Berlin era sound (albums ""The Idiot""/""Lust for Life"") and the singing/lyrics of ""American Caesar"". Don't get me wrong- this is not a rehash using popular albums a framework for success. The album is very modern. In a few years after the novelty has worn off, I suspect I'll still consider a few of these songs ( ""Gardenia"", ""Sunday"") top-pop!",return form pop well bounc around form probabl doesnt care anyon say foray french crooner wasnt exactli tast anyway great rock album big fan matt helder drummer amaz arctic monkey although im fan josh homm queen stone age band instrument play product album admir best way describ took berlin era sound album idiotlust life singinglyr american caesar dont get wrong rehash use popular album framework success album modern year novelti worn suspect ill still consid song gardenia sunday toppop,1503360000,5

48083,72,865,"This Is one of Howard Jones top hits from the 80's. Things Can Only Get Better to me is about life in general, I think they wore this gem out back in the day.

I learned a couple of things about this duo who scraped together different styles as they were developing their own harmonic sounds. This record is pretty much an acoustic fare with their voices and guitars and their original works like Sparrow and The Sound of Silence and He Was My Brother stand head and shoulders above their covering of others songs (yes, even above Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin). The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more.

48154,6754,3460,"In my continuing quest to find large, outstanding compilations of classical music at bargain prices, I have been very successful, unearthing several Big Box MP3 albums from The Bach Guild for 99 cents. They include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Big-Box-Bach-Orchestral-Music/dp/B00KS0ASOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Big Box :: Bach Orchestral Music</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Handel-Oratorio-Box/dp/B00KICWEN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Handel Oratorio Box</a>, and others. So far, I have found each of them a delightful listening experience.

I recently added Big Beethoven Box to my digital library. This is the first of two Big Box albums featuring the works of Ludwig van Beethoven (the other being&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bigger-Beethoven-Box/dp/B01BHELQD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bigger Beethoven Box</a>, which I have previously reviewed), and it is very good. It contains a wide selection of Beethovens compositions, including piano sonatas, cello sonatas, string quartets, three of his nine symphonies, incidental music for The Creatures of Prometheus and Egmont, as well as piano variations, minuets, sonatinas, overtures, rondos, and other works. All are performed with a high degree of artistry by a variety of world-class, but lesser known musicians.

Although I think Big Beethoven Box it is very good, and certainly upholds the high standards of the other Big Box sets I own, I do have two minor reservations about it:

1. There are no piano trios on ""Big Beethoven Box."" Some of my favorite Beethoven chamber music masterpieces  especially his Archduke and Ghost trios  belong to this sub-genre, and I think the fact that none of them are included makes this a less comprehensive and well-rounded album.

2. The albums engineering does not quite rise to the level of the best Big Box albums  especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Mozart-Box/dp/B00B5Q7M90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Mozart Box</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Haydn-Box/dp/B00CMAM8QA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Haydn Box</a>. On most tracks, the sound is bright, clear, and well-balanced, but on a few others, the audio quality seems murky to my ears, and individual instruments are sometimes difficult for me to hear.  There are also a few technical glitches to the album that require manual editing of individual tracks metadata. (See reviewer Upstate Listeners excellent review for tips on how to fix these problems.)

Despite my concerns about Bigger Beethoven Box, I still think it is a very good sampler of Ludwig van Beethovens music. With first-rate performances by world-class musicians, its (for the most part) excellent audio quality, and its low price of 99 cents, it makes for an overall highly rewarding listening experience.

It's not just a good song, but a powerful anthem toward being the best you can be and following your dreams.  And while that may seem like a saccharine message in our day and age, it's still a meaningful one, and one we need to remember.
