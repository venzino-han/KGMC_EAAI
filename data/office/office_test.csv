The only thing that could possibly have been better is if a drone dropped it off at my window with an order of some Amazon Fresh items.

One thing some people might forget to do is to recycle the used toner.  All you have to do is go to the Brother website and go into your account and just printout a free return label and drop it off at the post office.

33502,6557,2912,"Summary: Definitely worth buying. I have used the black jetstream a few years. Bought the 4 pack to get more colors only to find 2 of them 4 are black, one is blue and one is red. I own dozens of fine point drawing pens like Pigma Microns and only a few rollerball pens.

Pros: Jetsreams are the smoothest flowing compared to Pentel EnerGel-X 07 (2nd smoothest), Pilot FriXion Ball Slim .38 (erasable), and Pilot HI-TEC-C .25. Colors are bright except the Pentel EnerGel has a more vibrant cobalt-like blue under the pastel model. Caps fit tightly, almost too tight. No issues about falling off cap unless not properly secured. Smudges only slightly if using left hand. No worse than the Pigma Micron 01 which is not bad for a large tip 1.0 pen. Can clearly identify it by feel in the bottom of a bag/purse because of the raised model name.

Cons: Still has seams from the mold that are not cleanly removed like the pen I bought several years ago. Looks a little cheap because of it. (See pics). Bumps used to hold cap could cause fatigue for those holding the pen higher above the tip. Blue and black pens have the same black barrels since only the caps show the color. Both inks look black in the see-thru windows. Can easily put the caps on the wrong pen. Only the red ink is obvious.

It takes a regular refillable ink converter, included, unlike the mini converter used by the Kaweco, which you must purchase separately and which holds less ink.  However the nib itself, at least on the pen I received, is severely scratchy, collecting bits of scratched off paper that must be cleaned off every few minutes, nothing at all like the excellent silky smooth nib on the Kaweco pen.  Granted, the German-made Kaweco sells for four times what this sells for, but the nib is the most important component on a fountain pen, and also the most likely to have problems and to reflect production flaws.  If you don't care about a severely scratchy nib this pen is great.  But if you do care about the nib, this pen is problematic.  Just know what you're getting.

It feels amazing, it's nice and heavy, feels like the quality item that it is, and has never let me down. You do need to be a bit careful with it (so it may not be ideal for kids), as it's possible to bend the metal shroud around the tip of the emerging lead if you drop it on a hard surface tip-first. This pencil is my favorite writing instrument, and it's what I use for my daily planning, goal-setting, note-taking, and other things. I would suggest a separate eraser. The one on the pencil (under the cap) works great, but it's small, and while replacements can be found, they're not super cheap:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Staedtler-Mechanical-Pencil-Eraser-Refill-for-Drafting-Pencils-925-92R/dp/B006CQSOG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Staedtler Mechanical Pencil Eraser Refill for Drafting Pencils 925 (92R)</a>.

34082,6837,3476,"I have two different Sofia + Sam Laptop Desks and I will compare both in this review... The USB one vs. All Purpose Lapdesk
1) I far prefer the All Purpose Desk. It has a larger surface area for working and distributes the weight on your legs more evenly. It is also not as high as the USB one, which I prefer. There is also less of a slanted surface. It does not come with a usb lamp.
2) The USB one is about 2/3 the size of the All Purpose Desk and far more slanted. It is heavier and feels more weighty on my legs. The USB light is a handy feature to have, but I never use it because the light doesn't shine very well or disburse the light well enough to really make use of it. I always use my overhead or table lamps instead.
3) All in all, both have equal wrist pad height and gel, but the All Purpose version is significantly longer than the USB version, which is beneficial for those doing computer work all day or with carpal tunnel complaints.
At night, in bed, my husband and I stack the USB version on top of the All Purpose version for perfect viewing height of the laptop. Add in a sound bar and you have a cozy night ahead of you.

34243,4780,1003,"I'm a mid-level colorist who is finally sick of zentangled and whimsical images and wanted to try my hand at realism. As that can't be achieved with gel pens, I bought both Premiers and Verithins. I advise any other colorists to do the same.

Premiers are very soft and are great for filling in space. They are as smooth as butter and glide over good paper in most books. But they do not remain sharp for more than a few seconds and that makes them bad for fine lines and edging and such. I found myself constantly sharpening them in order to do edges all the while thinking how much of each pencil was going into the sharpener rather than my coloring book. They come sharpened and I have had no problem sharpening them with a Faber Castell sharpener. I have had no lead breaking at all.

That's when I realized my mistake and went and got the Verithins. They are very hard and you can get them super sharp and they stay that way for quite some time so are great for edges and the tiniest spaces. The colors in the sets are not the same but that turned out to be an advantage as it adds a level of shading or shadows. The Verithins were not sharpened when they came in, one had a split on it. I used a Faber Castell sharpener and had a problem with only one pencil's lead breaking but a resharpening went fine.

Between the two types I am a happy camper and am teaching myself how to shade, blend and do gradents and can see my work getting better.",1526688000,4,im midlevel colorist final sick zentangl whimsic imag want tri hand realism cant achiev gel pen bought premier verithin advis colorist premier soft great fill space smooth butter glide good paper book remain sharp second make bad fine line edg found constantli sharpen order edg think much pencil go sharpen rather color book come sharpen problem sharpen faber castel sharpen lead break that realiz mistak went got verithin hard get super sharp stay way quit time great edg tiniest space color set turn advantag add level shade shadow verithin sharpen came one split use faber castel sharpen problem one pencil lead break resharpen went fine two type happi camper teach shade blend gradent see work get better

I had the opportunity to compare between few pens: (will cover 6 pens here)
======================
among other pens, I managed to try, see photos for a better comparison
======================
in short

Pen1- CROSS Bailey Medalist Rollerball Pen with Gold-Plated Appointments incl. Premium Gift Box
looks very very nice
feels premium in the had, and has some weight (37g)
packaging is ok for a gift but nothing special regarding the box look or feel.
it glides very smoothly when writing, and it has the right amount of ink coming out.
my preferred pen

Pen2- CROSS Century II Medalist Fountain with 23CT Gold Medium Nib incl. Premium Gift Box
very beautiful design especially the Fountain tip
very detailed oriented design
CROSS Fountain pens are very good for lots of writing, it has just the right amount of ink flowing, but if you use it for singing then don't go too fast as the line will start breaking (a solution for that is to press a bit harder on the paper)
lightweight compared to the others (22g)   not bad by any means

Pen3-  PARKER IM Fountain Pen, Light Blue Grey, Medium Nib with Blue Ink Refill (1931655)
looks very nice
lightweight compared to the others (24g)
I would go with the fine Nib rather than this medium Nib
I noticed that PARKER Fountain pens spill more ink while writing than other brands, thus you have to write fast or the paper will start absorbing the ink, which is not ideal for a lot of writing, though its very nice for signing documents, as the line will not start fading when you draw line very quickly. also, that makes the pen not suitable for glossy papers.
very smooth writing with it.

Pen4-  Parker Sonnet Medium Nib Stainless Steel Gold Finish Trim Gift Boxed Fountain Pen
love the design
the weight is in the middle (25g) compared to the others
very lovely box, one of the best
again: I noticed that PARKER Fountain pens spill more ink while writing than other brands, thus you have to write fast or the paper will start absorbing the ink, which is not ideal for a lot of writing, though its very nice for signing documents, as the line will not start fading when you draw line very quickly. also, that makes the pen not suitable for glossy papers.
I would go with the fine Nib rather than this medium Nib

Pen5- Waterman Expert Stainless Steel, Ballpoint Pen with Medium Blue refill (S0952100)
this pen is different than the ones before as its a dry-pen, similar to regular Pic pens.
looks very very nice
feels premium in the had, and has some weight (34g)
writes smoothly
would have been one of the best pens out there except I had issues with it spilling, which made a mark on my shirt few times and it ruined it

Pen6- Parker Stainless Steel with Chrome Colour Trim, Ballpoint Pen with Medium Black refill (S0809240)
looks nice
very slim
medium to lightweight (27g)
-  just a regular pen, thus ok for writing (you are getting it for the looks).

==============
between the pens here I would pick:
Pen1, then both Pen2 and Pen5
==============
Note:
All pens have been bought (by me and my family) nothing was sponsored or gifted by any retailer
I like all of the designs, thats why we got them :)
- Always read the details about the pen in the description by the seller (as they may change)
most Fountain pens include refills (and sometimes even extras)
I prefer pens with caps to eliminate spilling problem that may happen or accidental strokes.
And sorry for the video, first time and was difficult writing while the paper is away from me.

34574,559,2688,"Although the Envelopes were great in an envelope way, they are not printer friendly.  I have run hundreds of other envelopes, card stock, letter, ETC through my Color LaserJet printer and I just got done having to not only watch, but assist in feeding my first 100 envelopes into the printer.  Even doing this it still failed to pull the envelope from the manual feed tray into the printer occasionally causing me a minute or two for the printer to run through the paper jam cycle.

My best guess is the Self Sealing strip was too thick and constantly the feed roller would not grab the envelope tightly enough to pull it through.  If it got past there and hit the internal pulling rollers, it was OK, but that feeding roller would not regularly pull the envelope into the printer.  They were not packaged tightly, kind of loosely wrapped.  I don't know if they could be packaged tightly instead of loosely to keep them flat and uncurved.  They were curved/bowed since the packaging was loose and they were stored upright allowing them to curve a bit and were obviously stored in warm/hot temperatures to keep that bend.  Once they fed through my hot Laser Printer, they were flat, straight, and it felt a little thinner.

I also had issue with the self-seal strip.  I just clipped my nails and the strip seems to be end to end with the protective covering.  This causes the need for nails or a sharp something to get up under the edge.  I will say the adhesive was great.  It never pulled away from the envelope itself, but the protective strip was so difficult to remove, a few envelopes have creased corners on the fold where my nail caught the strip and it wouldn't release easily pulling the entire envelope corner with it.

I'm going to go back to non-self adhesive envelopes for my needs since it seems that extra strip isn't compatible with my Laser Jet printer.",1527120000,2,although envelop great envelop way printer friendli run hundr envelop card stock letter etc color laserjet printer got done watch assist feed first 100 envelop printer even still fail pull envelop manual feed tray printer occasion caus minut two printer run paper jam cycl best guess self seal strip thick constantli feed roller would grab envelop tightli enough pull got past hit intern pull roller ok feed roller would regularli pull envelop printer packag tightli kind loo wrap dont know could packag tightli instead loo keep flat uncurv curvedbow sinc packag loo store upright allow curv bit obvious store warmhot temperatur keep bend fed hot laser printer flat straight felt littl thinner also issu selfseal strip clip nail strip seem end end protect cover caus need nail sharp someth get edg say adhes great never pull away envelop protect strip difficult remov envelop creas corner fold nail caught strip wouldnt releas

I had the opportunity to compare between few pens: (will cover 6 pens here)
======================
among other pens, I managed to try, see photos for a better comparison
======================
in short

Pen1- CROSS Bailey Medalist Rollerball Pen with Gold-Plated Appointments incl. Premium Gift Box
looks very very nice
feels premium in the had, and has some weight (37g)
packaging is ok for a gift but nothing special regarding the box look or feel.
it glides very smoothly when writing, and it has the right amount of ink coming out.
my preferred pen

Pen2- CROSS Century II Medalist Fountain with 23CT Gold Medium Nib incl. Premium Gift Box
very beautiful design especially the Fountain tip
very detailed oriented design
CROSS Fountain pens are very good for lots of writing, it has just the right amount of ink flowing, but if you use it for singing then don't go too fast as the line will start breaking (a solution for that is to press a bit harder on the paper)
lightweight compared to the others (22g)   not bad by any means

Pen3-  PARKER IM Fountain Pen, Light Blue Grey, Medium Nib with Blue Ink Refill (1931655)
looks very nice
lightweight compared to the others (24g)
I would go with the fine Nib rather than this medium Nib
I noticed that PARKER Fountain pens spill more ink while writing than other brands, thus you have to write fast or the paper will start absorbing the ink, which is not ideal for a lot of writing, though its very nice for signing documents, as the line will not start fading when you draw line very quickly. also, that makes the pen not suitable for glossy papers.
very smooth writing with it.

Pen4-  Parker Sonnet Medium Nib Stainless Steel Gold Finish Trim Gift Boxed Fountain Pen
love the design
the weight is in the middle (25g) compared to the others
very lovely box, one of the best
again: I noticed that PARKER Fountain pens spill more ink while writing than other brands, thus you have to write fast or the paper will start absorbing the ink, which is not ideal for a lot of writing, though its very nice for signing documents, as the line will not start fading when you draw line very quickly. also, that makes the pen not suitable for glossy papers.
I would go with the fine Nib rather than this medium Nib

Pen5- Waterman Expert Stainless Steel, Ballpoint Pen with Medium Blue refill (S0952100)
this pen is different than the ones before as its a dry-pen, similar to regular Pic pens.
looks very very nice
feels premium in the had, and has some weight (34g)
writes smoothly
would have been one of the best pens out there except I had issues with it spilling, which made a mark on my shirt few times and it ruined it

Pen6- Parker Stainless Steel with Chrome Colour Trim, Ballpoint Pen with Medium Black refill (S0809240)
looks nice
very slim
medium to lightweight (27g)
-  just a regular pen, thus ok for writing (you are getting it for the looks).

==============
between the pens here I would pick:
Pen1, then both Pen2 and Pen5
==============
Note:
All pens have been bought (by me and my family) nothing was sponsored or gifted by any retailer
I like all of the designs, thats why we got them :)
- Always read the details about the pen in the description by the seller (as they may change)
most Fountain pens include refills (and sometimes even extras)
I prefer pens with caps to eliminate spilling problem that may happen or accidental strokes.
And sorry for the video, first time and was difficult writing while the paper is away from me.

I include this here only because there are multiple sellers with this same product and I am not sure how the reviews work for specific products/sellers or if they lump them together.

I like these pens generally. Getting used to how they work takes a bit of practice. Different angles change how they write. I think for most calligraphy uses, the 2.4 is perfect. The 1.5 is a little thin and the normal thicker down stroke is not very thick. The 3.8 sometimes turns into a black blob if you aren't careful, though it may work well for larger writing.  That said, if you write really large or need to do something like a poster, the 6.0 will be perfect.

The biggest con on these pens is the cap. It screws on, which is good. However, once you remove it, there is no place to put it. The design of the barrel, though comfortable to write with,  doesn't allow you to put the cap on the end. So it just hangs around loose.

Now that it has arrived and Ive had a chance to ink it up and give it the ol test drive, I can honestly say it does not disappoint!

Opening the pen up were greeted with the Jinhao standard universal converter, which is no bad thing. The Fine nib is more of a fine-medium, which is perfect for me, and glides on my Rhodia N* 81 DOT pad with almost zero feedback, when using Pilot Iroshizuku Murasaki-Shikibu ink. There is some line variation available and this combination lays down just wet enough without becoming dry. It really is an absolute joy to put to paper.

The fit and finish of this pen is beyond what any reasonable person has any right to expect in its price point and the ceramic offers a heft I have yet to experience in a pen anywhere near this class. It is a little thick in my hands, with a steep step from the large-ish barrel to the small-medium section, but it is nicely balanced and I got more comfortable with it as I wrote. The cap snaps off more easily than my other Jinhaos and does post, but makes the pen far too heavy for long writing sessions and throws the balance way off.

Im going to leave this one inked up for a while and alternate between it and my Royal Blue (marble) Jinhao X750 to decide if it isn't too heavy or bulky to maybe take over daily duties. In all, very happy with this purchase and I plan to use it quite a bit for years to come.

Positives
1. Cardboard is thick and protects the book
2. Easy to use, just fold
3. Buy them when they are on sale.

Challenges
1. One box was damaged as they are delivered just in shrink wrap, they are not inside a package if any kind.
2. If you want to use for mailing, you will have to use tape on all sides to ensure that its sealed.
3. Didnt quite fit my book, I had a small gap. See photo. The smallest measurement inside when creased measures 6 5/8 x 9 11/16. My book measured 6 11/16  x 9 9/16 x 1 3/8.
4. I used the box, a tiny bit of tape but also decided to put it into a lightly padded 10.5 x 15 envelope to mail.

Overall my cost to ship a book:
.76 (box) + 1.02 (envelope) + $3.68 (media mail for over 2 lbs but under 3). The total weight was about 2.75 pounds and total costs for each book shipped was $5.46. I had to mail 30 of the same book.

35204,7510,4379,"Review; Wing Sung 3009 Piston-Filled Demonstrator.

The Wing Sung 3009 is my favorite piston-filled demonstrator fountain pen so far.

The 3009 I received came in a 4-pack of EF-nibbed models in a variety of colors. There is the clear model featured here, as well as versions with colored caps and piston knobs in fluorescent pink, purple and yellow. There is a 4-pack of F-nibbed models as well, which substitute a green model for the fully clear model. I opted for the EF pack specifically for the fully clear model. You could very likely swap either just the nib from a F-nibbed model if youd like. These are Lamy-style nibs, so you could always buy those instead for a wider variety of widths, and for a more robust nib. More on that in a bit.

As mentioned, this is a fully clear piston-filled demonstrator with a Lamy-style EF nib, totally clear section and feed which shows off the ink inside very well, and a totally clear piston assembly, minus the piston itself which is black. Unusually, this is the only pen of this type where I have seen the entire piston assembly behind the piston filled with fluid. The blind cap/piston knob is quite easy to use and features a click-lock at the very top of its range of motion to keep the piston from inadvertently getting bumped and twisting while writing or in your pocket, which would force ink out of the pen and would be disastrous. The clear twist-off cap does post securely, and on the body, not on the piston knob, but it makes the pen quite long and imbalanced. Thankfully 3009 is long enough to write with quite comfortably unposted.

The nib was the single best EF I have ever written with, at least at first. It was incredibly smooth on Rhodia DOT pad with Pilot Iroshizuku Murasaki Shikibu ink, with zero feedback. When testing line variation I was quite surprised with the difference, but then when I continued to write, the line was now more of a Fine-Medium. Yup, I sprung it. Probably my fault, but I feel like I wasn't even using much pressure at all. I was able to carefully put a little pressure in reverse writing position to put the nib back in place, but this proved too easy to do as well, the damage had been done. These are very soft nibs. You can see the wave in the nib in the last picture. Disappointing, maybe. But as I mentioned before, the rest of this pen is my definition of perfection in a piston-filled demonstrator and Lamy-style nibs are cheap and easy to replace and come in a variety of widths. I will buy a replacement nib and enjoy this pen immensely for years to come, Im sure.

Also of note, the piston knob on 3 of the 4 of the 3009s I received clicked nicely into place at the top of its range of motion, while 1 did lock but did not really click like the others. Of course, this was the fully transparent model I was planning to keep for myself. In trying to correct that, I did determine that these disassemble by gripping the metal ring just under the piston knob and twisting. I swapped the knob and cap with one from one of the fluorescent models and Voil!, my clear demonstrator now clicked satisfyingly.

So, there you have it. Probably way too much information on an inexpensive fountain pen that you all should try. 

Highly recommended. 4.5 Stars.",1528329600,5,review wing sung 3009 pistonfil demonstr wing sung 3009 favorit pistonfil demonstr fountain pen far 3009 receiv came 4pack efnib model varieti color clear model featur well version color cap piston knob fluoresc pink purpl yellow 4pack fnib model well substitut green model fulli clear model opt ef pack specif fulli clear model could like swap either nib fnib model youd like lamystyl nib could alway buy instead wider varieti width robust nib bit mention fulli clear pistonfil demonstr lamystyl ef nib total clear section feed show ink insid well total clear piston assembl minu piston black unusu pen type seen entir piston assembl behind piston fill fluid blind cappiston knob quit easi use featur clicklock top rang motion keep piston inadvert get bump twist write pocket would forc ink pen would disastr clear twistoff cap post secur bodi piston knob make pen quit long imbalanc thank 3009 long enough write quit comfort unpost nib singl best ef ever written least first

I personally love to use it for loose sketching, and for spotting blacks when sketching with an extra fine point fountain pen; you can cover a large are with ink very rapidly with this pen.

It could also be interesting for lettering, maybe even regular handwriting, but I haven't done much writing at all with in and that's not really what I picked it up for.

The advantages of this pen are fairly obvious, you can get a very thick line at a low angle and a thinner line at a high angle. It doesn't behave exactly like a brush or flexible nib, i.e. it's not pressure that affects the line width but pen angle, but it can be used for a similar result. You can also flip it over a write with the back side of the nib, essentially just utilizing the very tip, and get fairly clean and even fine lines.

For me this pen in not very useful when doing clean drawing or writing, although it could be carefully used to do so, my experience and practice with this pen has not yet developed the dexterity for me to be confident to use it in anything tighter than sketchbook work.",1528329600,4,cool pen well worth cost your even slightli interest better made might expect 10 pen open lot possibl line variat happi accid free energet qualiti mark make person love use loo sketch spot black sketch extra fine point fountain pen cover larg ink rapidli pen could also interest letter mayb even regular handwrit havent done much write that realli pick advantag pen fairli obviou get thick line low angl thinner line high angl doesnt behav exactli like brush flexibl nib ie pressur affect line width pen angl use similar result also flip write back side nib essenti util tip get fairli clean even fine line pen use clean draw write although could care use experi practic pen yet develop dexter confid use anyth tighter sketchbook work

35305,3244,2603,"Here are my impressions installing and using the MFC-J895DW as a wireless printer with the provided start up ink cartridges and with application software installed on a Windows 7 laptop and a windows 10 laptop.

- Installed smoothly:  Installed as a wireless printer over a home network on both laptops.  USB and wired Ethernet is also provided.
- Great display:  The printer control/status display is easy to read and use with its high resolution and accurate touch screen.  A picture is attached of the screen.
- During installation the display provides each step.
- Easy Ink Install:  The ink cartridges are easy to installed, slide and click, color coded and easy to match to the color code on the printer.
- Long install time:  You have a choice to install setup and application software from a provided CD or to download.  During the install, which took about 30 minutes, the system actually used a combination of CD and internet download.
- Sets up network for you:  The printer searches for a network access point to connect to.  In my case I have 3 different wireless access points but the installation software was not smart enough to list all and only gave one choice.  Other access points can be selected but with more effort and technical details required.
- Power Saver:  The printer goes to sleep after a short period but wakes up quickly when accessed.
- Prints fast.  Rated for 10-12 pages per minute I was impressed with the speed for a normal resolution text page.
- Nice scan page feeder:  It has a scan page feeder and with the paper is inserted correctly ADF is displayed on the front screen.
- 2 side printing:  What a great feature and very easy to setup.
- Good print quality:  The print quality and the scan quality is very good.  The attached picture shows a side by side print of a 9.1M resolution photo printed on regular paper and then copied and printed.  There is virtually no difference in quality between the 2 results.
- For comparison, I also printed the same picture on a 10 year old Brother MFC465CN.  The attached picture shows a side by side comparison where the 465 printout is muddy and lower resolution.
- Easy access to rear.  Past printers have been touchy to get access to the rear for clear paper jams.  But this printer rear section removed very easily.
- The NFC works as I was able to print a picture from my phone after installing the Brother app.
- On the downside:  Ive always chosen Brother printers due to good after market much less expensive ink cartridges.  The cartridges used for this printer are fairly new but hopefully the aftermarket will catch up.

Conclusion:
The Brother MFC-J895DW is easy to install and super convenient to use wirelessly.  Its prints fast, holds a lot of paper and has good print quality.  On the downside a search revealed no aftermarket ink cartridges yet so for now to keep it fed one must purchase much more expensive Brother Cartridges .",1528502400,5,impress instal use mfcj895dw wireless printer provid start ink cartridg applic softwar instal window 7 laptop window 10 laptop instal smoothli instal wireless printer home network laptop usb wire ethernet also provid great display printer controlstatu display easi read use high resolut accur touch screen pictur attach screen instal display provid step easi ink instal ink cartridg easi instal slide click color code easi match color code printer long instal time choic instal setup applic softwar provid cd download instal took 30 minut system actual use combin cd internet download set network printer search network access point connect case 3 differ wireless access point instal softwar smart enough list gave one choic access point select effort technic detail requir power saver printer goe sleep short period wake quickli access print fast rate 1012 page per minut impress speed normal resolut text page nice scan page feeder scan page feeder paper insert correctli adf display front screen 2 side print great featur easi setup good print qualiti print qualiti scan qualiti good attach pictur

The instructions are pictures only, yes, but it's easy to match up which parts are what (they're listed A-G and labeled on the diagram).

The whole thing took about 3 minutes for me to assemble with just an electric screwdriver. Might take 10-15 if you have a manual, because getting the 3-in-1 screw into the wood with a manual screwdriver can be a pain.

The Good:
- Installed smoothly:  Installed as a wireless printer over a home network on both Windows 7 and 10 laptops.  The only other interface provided is USB.  A huge disappointment that wired Ethernet is not also provided.
- During installation the display provides each step to get going.
- Easy Ink Install:  The ink cartridges are easy to install, slide and click, color coded and easy to match to the color code on the printer.
- Long install time:  You have a choice to install setup and application software from a provided CD or to download.  During the install, which took about 30 minutes, the system actually used a combination of CD and internet download.
- Sets up network for you:  The printer searches for a network access point to connect to.  In my case I have 3 different wireless access points but the installation software was not smart enough to list all and only gave one choice.  Other access points can be selected but with more effort and technical details required.
- Power Saver:  The printer goes to sleep after a short period but wakes up quickly when accessed.
- Prints fast in B/W, not so much in color..  Rated for 12 pages per minute in B/W but only 6 in color.  I was impressed with the text speed for a normal resolution text page.
- Nice scan page feeder:  It has a scan page feeder and with the paper is inserted correctly ADF is displayed on the front screen.  Even when asleep the printer will wake up when a page is inserted to be scanned.
- 2 side printing:  What a great feature and very easy to setup.
- Good print quality:  The print quality and the scan quality is very good.  The attached picture shows a side by side print of a 6 MB resolution photo printed on regular paper and then copied and printed.  The printed is on the left and the scanned is on the right.  There is only a small difference discernible by eye in the quality between the 2 prints.
- For comparison, I also printed the same picture on a 10 year old Brother MFC465CN.  The attached picture shows a side by side comparison where the 465 printout on the right is muddy and lower resolution.
- Easy access to rear.  Past Brother printers have been touchy to get access to the rear for clear paper jams.  But this printer rear section removed very easily.

The Bad:
- Mediocre front panel display quality and awkward user input:  The printer control/status display small but readable and it is not touch screen.  The changes are very awkward to implement using the keypad arrows to move the cursor on the display or select numerical entries.  A throwback user interface to 10 years ago.  See picture attached.
- No wired Ethernet interface:  A port for wired Ethernet is not provided.  This can be very useful just for the utility of the printer but also to troubleshoot issues.  It makes no sense to me not to provide the most common interface in the world.
- Expensive ink Cartridges.  The one site that listed  a LC3011BK for $20 stated it was unavailable.  If thats the cost then a set of cartridges cost almost as much as the printer.  The cartridges used for this printer must be new and hopefully the aftermarket will catch up.

Conclusion:
The Brother MFC-J491DW is easy to install and convenient to use wirelessly.  Its prints black and white fast at 12ppm, holds a lot of paper and has good print quality.  However the user interface on the front panel is awkward to use and it has no wired Ethernet interface.

Both pens suffer from horrible cap inserts that make posting hit or miss, which is a major peeve with me. Everything else is average and tolerable.

But then I got to using it and, while I was unimpressed with the appearance (simple, matte black) it was the kind of understated product I do prefer. It wouldn't qualify as ""elegant"", but it is more attractive than I expected.

As to the use of the pen; the more I use it, the more pleased I am. It came with both a plate press cartridge (refillable via ink bottle; the thing people who don't use fountain pens picture) and a replaceable ink cartridge. Being that it's still primarily for practice I use the cartridges for the sake of simplicity, and have not had the opportunity to test the plate press. When I do, I'll update this review.

The lines have been smooth and easy, the nib is sturdy and doesn't catch, and the weight of the pen is on the heavy side, but easy to use for hours at a time.

Regarding the ink, I ordered a pack of Pilot/Namiki IC-100 cartridges, and it took me several dozen pages to exhaust the first of them. The ink does not dry in or on the nib in such a way as to cause any difficulty, and I've only had to clean the tip of dried ink once, when I left the pen sitting for several days without use. Of course those who use fountain pens will know this is a no-no, but if this is your first such pen then try to make sure you get the ink flowing (write!) every couple of days at the least. That said, clean-up was simple and took less than 5 minutes. Pilot includes clean-up instructions in the box.

I'm not an expert calligrapher or fountain pen enthusiast. I bought this product because, simply, it was recommended by Amazon with the penmanship guide I was purchasing the same day, and I have been increasingly pleased with that decision every day since.",1528675200,5,get older tremor hand begun get wors bought pen along set penmanship book relearn write well much expens fountain pen alreadi one specif keep desk home got use unimpress appear simpl matt black kind underst product prefer wouldnt qualifi eleg attract expect use pen use plea came plate press cartridg refil via ink bottl thing peopl dont use fountain pen pictur replac ink cartridg still primarili practic use cartridg sake simplic opportun test plate press ill updat review line smooth easi nib sturdi doesnt catch weight pen heavi side easi use hour time regard ink order pack pilotnamiki ic100 cartridg took sever dozen page exhaust first ink dri nib way caus difficulti ive clean tip dri ink left pen sit sever day without use cours use fountain pen know nono first pen tri make sure get

Aside from common quality issues, there is always the challenge of finding a cushion that properly fits one's own tush - that's as much a matter of its size and contours as it is firmness.  This cushion seems to be as well made as any others I've had.  The gel does add firmness.  My glutes are thin (with age) which makes many cushions too firm for me even though they work fine for others.  I have become accustomed to this one, and the gel is preventing it from depressing too much under my 160 lb weight so my coccyx remains protected.  I tried the version of this cushion without the gel, and it flattened such that there was pressure on my tailbone, so it had to go back.  Additionally, the contours work with the size/shape of my hips/thighs.  Some cushions are a flat wedge, which for me works a little while on more flat surfaces, but this cushion's contours (along with the gel) make it much more comfortable for long sitting periods and on various surfaces.

This case is made of a nice, soft but durable-feeling PU Leather that even smells nice! It seems plenty flexible for getting pens in and out, but Id also trust just tossing it in a bag or in the trunk of a car and expect my pens to still be in great shape. (Obviously don't leave inked fountain pens in a hot car).

The zipper pull is metal (both of my cases have gold tone) but the zipper teeth are plastic, meaning you don't scratch your pens while sliding them in and out. The elastic straps inside are strong enough to keep your pens from rubbing on each other, but flexible enough to fit even large diameter pens such as my Jinhao 950 Ceramic model! I bought this model of case specifically for the dual straps for each pen. There is a nice center divider and the entire interior is lined in a soft microfiber.

This is a nice, affordable, portable storage solution for your fountain pens. Its easily nice enough to carry your fanciest writing instruments, while being affordable enough for my collection of Jinhaos. I have 11 pens in one of my cases now, and although they do fill it up nicely, it is still easy to open and zip shut to get pens in and out.

It works well with graphite, less well with charcoal. Works on anything normally erasable.

PRO TIP: if you generally use the side for erasing, where possible, you can achieve and maintain a finer tip, much narrower than the 2.3mm width of the eraser.

The white eraser is soft enough to not damage the paper and the barrel fits closely, to help the tip remain fairly rigidly in place, allowing for great control.

I only purchased this to use occasionally, like to print annual tax information, travel reservations, visa applications, medical, and financial records etc, so it won't be used daily.

My unit arrived with the ink installed (full cartridges), already set up and ready to use.  All I had to do is wirelessly connect it to my wifi.

I declined instant ink since it will sit 75% of time. They do have a free instant ink now for 15 pages per month.  But, I'll pass for now.

I tested every feature and the only one I'm unable to use right now is the scan to computer.  My computer is in storage and I haven't used it in months since now I only use a smartphone and tablet.  All the other features worked and meshed just find.  I really like the fact that the printer has it's own email address so you can print from a device that doesn't have a direct connection to the printer via synching or app installation.

The body feels study and refillable, and I expect it to last quite some time; I've been using the same one for almost two years now.",1528934400,5,favorit era use much like pencil draw white ad highlight etc era unwant pencil mark easili leav line want avoid smudg pen line havent fulli dri work well graphit le well charcoal work anyth normal era pro tip gener use side era possibl achiev maintain finer tip much narrow 23mm width era white era soft enough damag paper barrel fit close help tip remain fairli rigidli place allow great control bodi feel studi refil expect last quit time ive use one almost two year

35739,7510,1489,"Review: Jinhao 601.

The 601 is another of Jinhaos brass-constructed fountain pens with a painted finish. This one differs from the ubiquitous X750 and X450 by being decidedly less thick and weighty, though it still has enough heft to avoid feeling as inexpensive as it is.

The snap cap reveals a textured metal grip section which feels good in the hand to some users but that is not a universal opinion. That same textured section also seems to capture a lot of ink while inking this pen. Interestingly, the section appears to be threaded where it meets the body but these are in fact just rings which are stacked as a design element, not threads. The cap posts securely and doesnt make the pen too heavy but does make it unbalanced for my taste.

As usual, this Jinhao comes with their quality standard international converter and no cartridges, so I inked it up with my usual Pilot Iroshizuku Murasaki-Shikibu and hit the Rhodia *80 DOT pad running.

The nib is Jinhaos standard silver #5 with their nice ornamentation, though this one came in Fine and as usual, I much prefer their Medium. The writing experience is fairly smooth, I would classify the feedback as moderate, but not scratchy. There was an issue with slow starts on this one, however. There is some line variation available, though reverse writing yielded the thinnest, scratchiest, most unusable line Ive achieved yet in a fountain pen.

The ergonomics of the pen are comfortable, if just on this side of thin and short. Thankfully it is not too light as this occasionally reads as cheap, particularly for an all-metal pen. The 601 is a bit shorter in length than some of their other models, but it fits in my medium hands unposted.

In the end, I didn't end up spending a lot of time writing with the Jinhao 601, mostly due to my preference for Medium nibs over this Fine nib. In the coming weeks I plan to order a pack of 2-tone Jinhao #5 Medium nibs to put on my Jinhaos which came with Fine nibs. When that happens I will give these another shot and update the reviews. I really enjoyed the rest of this pen, as I have all of my Jinhaos thus far. My rating is based on that, given the nib is personal preference and is easily corrected.

Highly recommended. 4.5 Stars.

35798,1229,4306,"This is a pretty nifty tool for a variety of applications, most of which relate to education and science. For me, I have a book of sewing patterns, and I used to have to work with a grid and then draw another on newspaper or something else to then make these into paper patterns. So glad that's over now. With this, I can project the page onto a wall, where I use painter's tape to secure the paper there, and then draw directly. For proper scale, just make sure the surface has a ruler, and the page in question has a little scale thing showing what a unit there amounts to on your wall. Example: 1/16 of an inch equals an inch. Draw a little 1/16 inch square on the page and have a little 1 inch square on the wall, and make sure it lines up correctly for the right proportion. There are other ways, but that's what worked for me. It worked fine with a projector I got on Vine a while back--no fuss!
I'm also excited at the possibility of doing some reviews or tutorials using this, since the record feature is pretty easy to use, and you can get a detailed, up-close look at items.

36020,4889,20,"I have had one or more Neat scanner for years. You must baby them and expect absolutely NO support. They contract out all of their support to out of US companies who could care less about the quality of support they try to provide. On the other hand, if you like beating your head against a wall, this product is for you! When I originally purchased my $450 scanner there was no subscription service. The money trolls in Neat figured out how to make millions by removing support and upgrades for their local PC software and go to a subscription base. If you have had files saved on your hard drive they offer a migration or Sync service when signing up for their monthly subscription service.  Problem is, it does not work completely. You will be left wondering what documents did and did not Sync. Neat has to be one of the greatest failures of how to launch a product and fail. You could write a book on their total failure to support one of the nicest and productive products in the world. I am an IT Mgr of over 35 years and began the revolution of scanning and electronically filing documents for one of the largest Corps in the world.

But I didn't want a keyboard tray; I still want my keyboard at desk level, not below. I just wanted something that would bridge the corner of my desk. Unfortunately everything that's actually made for that purpose is SUPER EXPENSIVE. So I thought I'd just get a lap desk instead and deal with it that way. (If I have to use a lowered keyboard, I at least wanted it in my lap.) But little did I know, I was able to use this lap desk as a corner piece for my desk!

First, the padding on the bottom comes off. It's held on with several strips of velcro. So I took off the padding, then ripped off the velcro, and pulled out the staples. Now it's perfectly flat on the bottom. I put it flat on my desk, with the handle (wider) side facing me, and the narrower side pointing towards my monitor. And this works GREAT! I can use the handle to move the tray around, when I want to adjust where my keyboard sits. I can pull it closer, move it away, rotate, etc. I can also move my keyboard to one side and fit my mouse on the board if I want to, too. I have a small tea towel at the bottom as padding for my wrists.

This one will fax and do color copies, in addition to two sided copies.  I really wanted a flat bed copier.  I probably use that more than the printer itself.  Fortunately this one does.

The pictures I am hanging vary in size and include 4x6, 5x7, and 8x10s.  They are not in frames or anything like that, just the plain prints. The drywall is painted and slightly textured.

I was a bit hesitant to purchase after reading the negative reviews on here, but decided to try them myself.  These hangups appealed to me for several reasons:

1. I did not want to do anything permanent to my wall space or cause damage to the walls, no nails, holes, etc.
2. I wanted the flexibility to change out and rearrange pictures as needed.
3. Ease of use.

So far I have not had trouble with pictures falling off the wall.  I followed the directions included in the package, making sure to rub/press the sticker firmly so that it sticks to the wall.  The magnets that come in the set are very strong.  I even have a ceiling fan on high in the space - I was concerned that it may affect the pictures, but it has not.

After printing, copying, and scanning, using both the Bluetooth and wired USB connections, I have to say this is a mighty good printer.  The only improvement I would like to see is a deeper paper tray.  This tray holds around half a ream.  If the tray held a full ream (package of paper) then I wouldn't have half a ream laying around.  But that's in a perfect world.  In the real world this is a solid printer.  It's reliable.  I have no grumbles.

These printers excel at being stingy with ink.  The cartridges are long lasting, particularly if you get the XXL size.

Why is this my FOURTH Brother printer?  Because I literally wore two out, got a third, and now I have two work locations so I'm adding the fourth printer there.

And while I was at it, why not buy the brightly colored poly ones?  So I spent a bit more than I wanted to, only to discover that these folders have some really stupid design flaws.
First, the plastic is incredibly flimsy but rigid, which means it breaks sooooooo easily.  Just my initial filing caused them to crack and break, so there's no way they'll hold up over time.  But even more annoying is the way they designed the tops.
The hanging part slides in and out for some reason, which is fine, but there's a sealed bit inside that area on the ends that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to insert the tabs.  These are 5th cut tabs that you should be able to line up end to end in the folders -- 5 across.  But the end slots are blocked by that sealed area inside, meaning the tabs can't possibly go in the way they should.  Did Smead not even test out their own design?  Seriously, the first tab I tried to insert wouldn't go in because of this blockage, and every other folder in 4 different packs was exactly the same way.  I had to insert a pocket knife in each end of each folder to break that seal, just so I could insert the tabs.

I need a handcart that lets me (71 years old with bad arthritis) move my very expensive and very heavy (35 lb+) sewing machine upstairs and out to the car when I take it in for servicing.  This UpCart looked like just the ticket.  But the reviews which mentioned that hinge-affair at the corner of the upright and the ""platform"" part of the cart which effectively prevents you from placing even a moderate sized box securely on the cart---were all correct.  A box the size of a case of printer paper must be put on end in order to go securely on the cart.  Anything wider than that will have only 6.5"" of platform to sit on, and even with a bungee cord securing it, it's not much of a support.  I would have to put my sewing machine on its end to carry it at all.  Not going to do that and jeopardize a sophisticated and finely adjusted piece of machinery.  My husband tested the cart out with a printer paper box filled with some lightweight fleece fabric and brought it up the 13 steps from our basement.  He said it was ridiculously difficult to get up over each step, even with the three rotating wheels.  If my big strong husband has trouble with it, I know for a fact it doesn't work well.

I can pop them in and out, slide them to the side, no fuss. My slot-rails are 68"" (based on what I had in the scrap bin) so I can insert one board or both.

36562,6707,2029,"Let me start by saying that upon opening the box, one of the pens obviously had ""bled out"" inside it's wrapper. It was all crispy & dried, so it happened awhile ago. The wrappers must be excellently sealed, because none of the paint leaked out all over the other pens. I was kind of disappointed, because I use silver a lot, & the set is not cheap. Besides that:
 The pens are incredible. The colors are what I love most. They are all bright, & once they dry completely, they hold their color.
  Some of the reviews for these & other paint pens had me a little worried. I've had several paint pens over the years & they are not like any other medium. I've had my share of splats, puddles & shredded tips, which can be awful if you ruin a project, or have to toss an expensive pen. You can't use them like other pens & markers. With a little patience, you can avoid a mess & keep your investment for awhile.
  The most important thing is the priming. After shaking the closed marker a few times so you hear the mixers inside, take off the lid holding the tip up. The point is dry the 1st time, but after that, sometimes he shaking will fill the tip. If you pull the lid off over your clothes, or with he point down, you may end up with paint everywhere. Next you need to prime the pen. It says to push the point up & down several times. I've seen people whack it over & over. Don't. Push it down gently & hold it a few seconds. Check if you see the paint moving into the point. Push & hold again until you have a flow going. Keep a stack of old newspapers nearby & always check the flow before touching it onto your project. Shake gently every so often while using. As soon as you finish with it, put the cap on right away.  You can't really use several pens at the same time since each one needs to be primed before use & capped when it's not. Shouldn't be a problem if you do a bit of planning first.
  These are excellent quality pens. When I need more & I save up a bit, I'd definitely choose this brand again.",1532304000,5,let start say upon open box one pen obvious bled insid wrapper crispi dri happen awhil ago wrapper must excel seal none paint leak pen kind disappoint use silver lot set cheap besid pen incred color love bright dri complet hold color review paint pen littl worri ive sever paint pen year like medium ive share splat puddl shred tip aw ruin project toss expens pen cant use like pen marker littl patienc avoid mess keep invest awhil import thing prime shake close marker time hear mixer insid take lid hold tip point dri 1st time sometim shake fill tip pull lid cloth point may end paint everywher next need prime pen say push point sever time ive seen peopl whack dont push gentli hold second check see paint move point push hold flow go keep stack old newspap nearbi alway check flow touch

36623,6125,3540,"First, let me say the pencils color nicely, smooth (except the lightest yellow which was hard) and easy to lay down the color.  The watercolor effects with brush and water are lovely, and the included brushes were better than expected. The selection of colors is great.

However the lack of color numbers or names on each pencil turned out to be a HUGE inconvenience.  The colors of the barrels mostly do not match the actual color of the leads so in order to figure out which pencil was the color I wanted I had to attach numbers to each pencil.  Sounds easy, but regular tape did not stick, and I ended up wrapping the ends of each pencil in white medical tape and writing numbers on each pencil with a sharpie, and then making a numbered/colored guide to show which numbered pencil was which color.

So, while I like the way the pencils perform, I hate having to number them.  And the tape looks tacky.  I will NOT buy this brand again. I will make double sure that when I replace these pencils I buy a brand that numbers/names each pencil.

The pencils come in a nice metal case that I had my husband take apart (detach the lid from the bottom) so I could use them like trays.

On the positive, this is a friendly design, easier to use and comes with molds and bodies for various insects and bees to make. I think the wall I face is hand eye and fine motor coordination. I also want to say that the instructions that came with it are less than illuminating.

Although the idea of this is appealing, I was still unsuccessful in duplicating the beautifully done examples on the box. The molds do work but my outcomes were a lot more like twisted filament jammed into molds. It is very possible this craft is not for me. I am pretty certain at this point that I lack the finesse to make it in the high flying 3Doodler world.

36790,3289,4423,"I am very happy with the C-Line Reusable Poly Envelopes. They are not like some plastic sleeve holders I've had in the past, ones that are thin and crack easily. The C-Line variety is made from a substantial plastic that's like magic. It's smooth and durable, yet it retains a lightweight profile that makes them easy to manage and store. The sides are reinforced making it seem impenetrable to wear and tear.

My wife absconded with several of the envelopes to use for her music studies. She needed a way to organize and protect the pages and bindings from being compromised during transport to her piano lessons. They are the perfect size for accommodating varied thicknesses and they do an excellent job providing added protection to any book or document.

The velcro attachment is a modern update on the traditional hook and loop style. It's fun to use and does a good job staying in place. Not only is this a highly functional, versatile product, it comes in sumptuous colors that enhance the organizational value. My wife organized her music books by color, making it an easy to retrieve accessory that's attractive sitting on her piano or shelf. As a designer, I appreciate the aesthetics of this sleek, modern looking envelope that feels good in the hand.

I highly recommend the C-Line Reusable Poly Envelope. The product page video provides good additional info and comports with my positive experience using them. In fact, I will probably be ordering these again in the near future. It's a good value for a sturdy office supply that looks good too!

- Quiet operation
- Powerful motor
- Large capacity bin
- Doesnt jam easily

The Bad:
- Tried 14 sheets of paper (listed maximum) and it wouldnt shred (did 12 just fine though)
- Comes with 1 bag liner BUT you don't have to use with the liner. The liner only makes clean up easier.

The Bottom Line:
This is a fantastic shredder for home or small office use. Its powerful and quiet. You can use the machine with either a liner or without. It comes with 1 liner so youd have to buy more if youd want more. It has a large capacity container so you can shred a lot. The reason for taking off 1 Star was the listed maximum is 14 pages but I tried 14 pages and it basically said there was too much paper. It did 12 sheets just fine though. Overall I would still recommend this shredder for its quiet operation and shredding performance.

37057,7510,4396,"Review: Wing Sung 3001 Fountain Pen!

At first glance, the Wing Sung 3001 seems like your everyday, typical, run of the mill fountain pen. And in some ways, it is. But is that such a bad thing?

I ordered the multicolor 5-pack which came with a clear demonstrator and translucent models in smoke, blue, a peachy orange and green. Each came with gold trim, gold tone EF nibs and standard international converters. I of course chose to ink up and review the translucent blue demonstrator model, so the remainder of this review will be based on that pen.

The 3001 is a very light but comfortable pen. It is of a nice medium length which should fit in most hands whether posted or not. It is also of a medium diameter which again should fit most people comfortably.

This pen is a cigar-style, with a small flat finial on the cap. Below that is the gold band for the gold clip, which is springy enough and not too stiff. The clip has WINGS stamped on it. Below the clip, in lieu of a cap band there is a gold painted double band with the Chinese characters for Wing Sung and the numbers 3001 printed in the lower band.

The cap unscrews with one full rotation, revealing a beautiful gold tone nib and the grip section, with a gold band separating the section from the barrel (this is a loose piece, take care not to lose it when inking or cleaning this pen). The nib has some beautiful border filigree, the Wing Sung propeller logo, the Wing Sung script and EF. The grip section has plenty of length to be comfortable for most writers and is of a nice medium diameter as well.

Writing with this pen, I found the nib to write more like a Fine than an Extra Fine, which is not a bad thing. The nib was fairly smooth and only offered minimal scratch and only on horizontal strokes in both directions. Minimal line variation is possible and reverse writing does produce a very fine line but is accompanied by significant scratchiness.

In all, this is a great value for money and would be a good way to introduce others to the hobby, or to just add to your collection.

37183,7634,903,"I'm very happy with this padfolio and definitely recommend.  I was in search for a padfolio that was simple and contemporary.  This product's aesthetics are better in person; clean lines and well constructed.  The notch on the card holders is smart.  I did have a stitch issue on the original purchase, however, I contacted the seller (they actually followed up before I contacted them), referenced the issue, and they sent a replacement right away.  They were very accommodating which is refreshing these days.
