29877,2917,85,"As someone who enjoys adult coloring (I've been at it since around 1992 or so), I tend to ""collect"" pens and colored pencils.  I have several different Sharpie sets, both fine point, and ultra-fine point.

This set contains some new colors (check the photos on the product page that show the new colors).  This is the ""fine point"" version, best suited for images with larger sections to color rather than some of the more popular highly detailed images that really do need that ultra-fine point.  I've used these for more detailed work, but I have to be REALLY careful and apply with a light hand.

As with all Sharpie pens, these are alcohol-based, meaning they will likely bleed through most coloring book pages.  But as they're permanent markers, they work on plastic really nicely -- like for marking plastic wine glasses/etc. at parties.

If you're looking for another set of Sharpies to replace an existing older set, this might be a good choice due to the new colors.  Quality is as expected from Sharpie.",1523491200,4,someon enjoy adult color ive sinc around 1992 tend collect pen color pencil sever differ sharpi set fine point ultrafin point set contain new color check photo product page show new color fine point version best suit imag larger section color rather popular highli detail imag realli need ultrafin point ive use detail work realli care appli light hand sharpi pen alcoholbas mean like bleed color book page theyr perman marker work plastic realli nice like mark plastic wine glassesetc parti your look anoth set sharpi replac exist older set might good choic due new color qualiti expect sharpi

There are a few issues: they do bleed through thinner papers, so unfortunately they aren't good for writing a lot on paper (class notes, letters, etc.). They tend to dry out fairly quickly. And finally, because the Sharpie permanent is a solvent ink, sometimes it *will* dissolve the surface under the pen tip (especially anything with a coating or paint or gesso) and while you can write with the pen on the surface for a while, the pen will get gunked up and be useless after that use.",1523491200,5,love sharpi write anyth wonder around hous craft everyth issu bleed thinner paper unfortun arent good write lot paper class note letter etc tend dri fairli quickli final sharpi perman solvent ink sometim dissolv surfac pen tip especi anyth coat paint gesso write pen surfac pen get gunk useless use

29898,1583,831,"Smooth paper but quality is nowhere close as Apica's. Binding (if I'm correct) is glue bound then taped.

My set arrived a bit banged up in the corner but that's not really the product's fault. Not that big of a deal; it's not the holy grail. Fixed it by clamping a binder clip and bending it the opposite way to flatten it out more.

I usually use gel pens or fountain pens to write notes and these do not take them well at all. They feather and ghost through the paper extremely and I used Pentel's Ener-gel, Waterman Tender Purple, and Noodler's Antietam and Bulletproof Black on them to test.

The ghosting is so bad you can still see it through 2 sheets for Ener-gel. Bulletproof Black was ""ok"" but only because it was a very washed out black compared to the true velvety saturated ener-gel. Because of this I switched to pencil, and even THAT still ghosted through, although obviously not as much as the others. You can see examples of ghosting through other people's product photos and see for yourself if you can handle it.

-1 star because seems like only pencil and very light colored inks would ""work"" on this paper.
-1 star because everything ghosts.

I do really like the dot feature. It's one of the main reasons I purchased this.

Would recommend if:
- you don't mind heavy ghosting/bleeding on your notes OR
- only plan to or mainly using pencil
- as a ""graphing"" book for chemistry or math as the lines and dots are very useful.

Great concept but really wish paper was thicker; would've concealed the ghosting a bit more.",1523577600,3,smooth paper qualiti nowher close apica bind im correct glue bound tape set arriv bit bang corner that realli product fault big deal holi grail fix clamp binder clip bend opposit way flatten usual use gel pen fountain pen write note take well feather ghost paper extrem use pentel energel waterman tender purpl noodler antietam bulletproof black test ghost bad still see 2 sheet energel bulletproof black ok wash black compar true velveti satur energel switch pencil even still ghost although obvious much other see exampl ghost peopl product photo see handl 1 star seem like pencil light color ink would work paper 1 star everyth ghost realli like dot featur one main reason purchas would recommend dont mind heavi ghostingbleed note plan mainli use pencil graph book chemistri math line dot use great concept realli wish paper thicker wouldv conceal ghost bit

29949,6161,734,"So I work in IT and when printer manufacturers stopped shipping .50cent USB Type A-to-B cables in their Networkable printers I laughed but somewhat understood since it makes more sense to network the printer if it's capable. However, this printer has no networking capability. This printer is also designed for simplicity hence that it advertises one button and ease of use. This would then cater to the less tech savvy people who just want a printer they can set up themselves. Do you think those people are going assume that the printer, when taken out of the box, is completely unusable unless you buy an extra part somewhere else? I cannot fathom for the life of me why HP does not include a .50cent USB cable given that it's literally a requirement for the printer to function out of the box. I still gave the printer 4 stars because with the cable it is a functioning printer for very cheap. They'll make the money back on the ink of course and how greedy of a company can you be where you don't include a usb cable...unbelievable.

30168,6255,3642,"Adore these!! But you have to know they're called ""souffl"" for a reason!! When you write, the ink is pretty much invisible on black paper. The color then ""rises"" very slowly, like a souffl puffing up, and within a minute (maybe a little longer....) it is fully visible!

The colors are very pastel, even paler than the colors of the pen caps in this picture of the product, and oh so sweet and delicate. I wouldn't imagine using these on anything other than colored paper because I can't imagine they'll show up on white paper. I write in my black paper journal a lot, so I haven't wanted waste ink on an experiment I am pretty darn positive will fail.

I hope any bad review is mitigated by this review since you need to know what you're getting into before you purchase these! The description provided by Sakura really fails on this product, unfortunately.

The only down side I would note is that there's a flip side to the ""cuteness"" of the souffl-like ink drying: when I write in my journal, when I reach the bottom of the page, I blow in the ink to encourage it to dry quicker. It's a little annoying to sit there and hold my thoughts, BUT, it also gives me a chance to really select the right words. So it's kind of a benefit and a detriment....

But I love love love these overall!! It looks really terrific on black paper, and I can also imagine them on colors like amethyst, fuchsia, ocean blue..... Any bold, jewel tone, or dark paper I assume it will look terrific on.

30193,6874,3990,"Bought this scale on 2/17/2017. It took several tries to get it to connect to our wifi. After that, for months, the transmissions were inconsistent. Sometimes, the sync would work right away but often, it would fail at first, and then catch up later in the same day. There were times it didn't sync properly for up to three days, but then would miraculously catch up again even on the older data.  Finally, after all those months of inconsistency, the Aria started to more consistently behave as advertised. We almost forgot about how poor it had been. Sorry to say, that didn't last. About a month ago, it stopped connecting to our wifi at all.  We tried everything we knew or could find on the web. We finally called Fitbit Aria support. ""Oh,"" the support person said, ""Comcast has changed the protocol; that's the problem."" He told me to call Comcast and tell them what protocol was needed for the Aria. I called. Comcast complied with the specified protocol change, but the Aria still wouldn't connect. Again, we called Aria support and spent nearly two hours on the phone with a woman who tried hard but really didn't know what to do to solve the problem. After the call, the Aria didn't sync, but then it synced properly the next morning.  We thought it was fixed. No. That was the last time it synced. It's been three weeks and three days now of not connecting to our wifi. I see it ""spins"" its little heart out but with no success. We're fed up. We have ordered a competitor's scale that promises to work with our Fitbit Charge 2's. We'll see. With all the complaints about the Aria online, it appears that Fitbit is selling a scale they know will not consistently work properly. That's a bit of arrogance, isn't it?!!

There is a lot of side taking about which one is better. It seems you are generally going to strongly prefer one over the other. So I ended up getting both because I couldn't decide. For me they both have great things going for them and they both have things I think could be improved. I don't think I have a conscious preference. I enjoy using both. I got a pretty good deal on these but they were still more expensive. Worth every penny I paid though time will tell. I will update if I have any complaints.

If you are anything like me I was stuck between these and the Rotring 600s because I wanted something that was going to last forever, feel good in hand and yes... look sharp. There is a lot of side taking about which one is better. It seems you are generally going to strongly prefer one over the other. So I ended up getting both because I couldn't decide.

31042,1814,84,"I love colored Sharpies for the same reasons as most people:  They are wonderful to color with, have a huge assortment of colors, the ultra fine tips are especially nice for small details and writing in greeting cards, journaling, making little signs and so on.  They will bleed through paper is my only gripe but I have learned to use them on surfaces where  that won't happen or if it does it won't hurt anything. So when I want to use my Sharpies for a coloring project, I simply copy the illustration onto a heavier card stock paper then the bleed through doesn't hurt anything on the reverse side.

31119,1784,2065,"This is a do-it-yourself kit.  You should have some experience with hand tools and with building furniture kits.
It's a bit tricky to put together so don't try to do it on the floor.  Build it on a bench or table.  Use some of the cardboard carton to protect the cart and the surface you're working on.  Tools needed, the included instructions notwithstanding:  #2 Phillips screwdriver, electric screwdriver with #2 Phillips bit, rubber mallet (a piece of soft wood and a metal hammer should work fine). accurate small square, wood glue (for loose dowels).
Optional:  I used small sheet metal screws to attach the back panel.  #4 x 1/2"" is about right.  You may require a #1 Phillips bit/screwdriver for the small screws.  Driving nails through MDF is no fun, so drill pilot holes for the screws if you use them.  A 7/64"" or #32 drill bit is about right for a #4 screw.  Drill just the MDF, not the cabinet wood.  Keep checking with that square.
Some screw holes in the cabinet are pre-drilled but not all.  Do not try to assemble this without an electric screwdriver of some sort.  If you can set the torque, set it for a low value and finish driving the screw by hand.  Be careful as the wood is soft.
The cabinet goes together pretty easily.  There are directions, but look at the drawings and the parts and you may see an easier way to assemble it.
Check it continually with a good square. Some of the dowels are undersized.  Don't bother sending for more;  just use a little Elmer's wood worker's glue for the loose ones.
The drawers are another matter.  There are no pilot holes for the screws.  You have to hold the parts carefully in position and then drive in one screw in each corner.  Use the drawer bottom to hold the front and two sides fairly square.  Keep checking with the square.  Use your fingers to make sure the parts are flush before driving a screw.
The screws do go in easily, but make sure they are right the first time as getting a screw to go in right next to a hole that's a little off is pretty difficult.
Once all five parts of the drawer are assembled, check again for squareness and then put in the remaining screws.
The ends of the parts and drawer bottoms are quite square, so once the screws are tightened, the drawer comes out pretty well.
The drawer slides work pretty well but there are no drawer stops so use caution when pulling out a loaded drawer.
The included casters are a waste time on carpet although they work OK on a hard floor.  Instead, look for an inexpensive set of non-marring (grey) casters at least 2"" in diameter.  Get plate casters, not stem casters.  Amazon is a good source.  Mount with four small Phillips or square drive screws. You might want to source the screws locally so that the heads won't pull through the holes in the caster plate but also won't interfere with the swivelling on the caster.
Good luck.

Unlike the blue or orange body 4-color pens that are made in France, these pens are made in Japan, so you know the quality, look, finish and parts have quality and lasting value. I tried the stylus on my iPhone and the rubber stylus tip at times fell flat and I wish the rubber tip was a bit sturdier or firmer. Other than that, the pen body itself is a bit larger than the orange or blue body 4-colored pens, and I found that the surface has a non-slip/not-smooth surface, so you are able to grip the pen easier and for longer time.

I purchased this because I was in the midst of a massive project when the first one began to give me problems.  (I believe that I had printed more than 5,000 copies with it over 6 years.) When this one arrived, I set aside a day to install it, get it working, inked up and attached to wi-fi.  Well, I accomplished that in less than an hour and got back to my project.  In the ensuing month, I printed in excess of 5,000 copies with nary a problem!  Using both black/white and color copying, I produced 22 binders of outstanding quality that has met with great acceptance.  I used card stock, white and colored bond, and label printing.

In short, it works very well on round pencils, but abysmally on pencils that have six sides, such as the Palomino Blackwings or the Papermate Mirado classics.

On the former, a fine smooth point is easily acquired, on the latter, the point is lead comes out jagged, as if it has been hacked rather than sharpened.  Truly unusable for some pencils.

Strange that it should be so, since the wood on all pencils is sharpened to a cylinder, but I'm writing it as I experience it, and will now order new sharpness for my ""good"" Palomino pencils.

(By the way, there is a special Palomino Blackwing sharpener, but that too had its problems.  It leaves a ledge.  So now I'm stumped about how to find a good sharpener.

31698,4036,333,I always need more manila file folders so was excited to get these.  They are just alright in my opinion.  These folders are made from a very light and thin stock material and are not very durable. If you plan on using the fasteners your papers will indeed stay in place.  The description of these folders shows them holding a lot of pages and I find the cardboard they are made of so thin that they would tear under such volume.  Also I like my folders to be multi-functional.  I only sometimes need fasteners and want them to also be ready to just hold regular pages and not need to worry about them falling out.  There is nothing within to keep pages in place other than the fasteners and after about 20 pages the lightness of the material fails to keep papers intact.  So I think if you use the fasteners and want to use these for no more than 50 pages or so you should be fine.  But for bulkier use or just as mere folders I recommend something sturdier.,1524700800,3,alway need manila file folder excit get alright opinion folder made light thin stock materi durabl plan use fasten paper inde stay place descript folder show hold lot page find cardboard made thin would tear volum also like folder multifunct sometim need fasten want also readi hold regular page need worri fall noth within keep page place fasten 20 page light materi fail keep paper intact think use fasten want use 50 page fine bulkier use mere folder recommend someth sturdier

32243,5509,107,I like this heavyweight paper and the fact that it's bright.

That's both a waste of paper and ink!  Now I put less in  my printer at one time and I  make sure to fan the paper out to avoid sticking.

32283,5789,3154,"This is a very high-quality, bright white (92), 20-lb paper that works terrifically with laserjet printers. Paper has really become expensive these days (remember when you could get a ream for a dollar?) and there's probably no turning back on that, but this set provides a good cost per page while offering a very good quality paper. The packing, too, is fantastic: each ream is wrapped in a plastic seal wrap, very neatly done, and then the three reams come in a custom fitted box exactly sized to the paper. So, you can keep that box to hold the other reams until you are read to use them, or, because of the great wrapping job of each ream, you can simply put those reams on the bookshelf, like a book, until needed (that's the approach I do).

It's hard to give a high rating when paper is so expensive these days, but trying to be as objective as possible, from the various options I have looked at, and the factors I've examined (whiteness, thickness, paper quality, wrapping, cost), this is one of the best I've come across, and it is now my defacto standard for home printing on my laser printer. Five Stars.

Note:
With the cost of paper, make sure that when you buy your next printer it prints duplex (i.e., both sides). It will cut your paper cost in half, and cuts waste and weight in half, too. Many inexpensive laser printers now offer duplexing, so make sure you check before you purchase another laser printer.",1525132800,5,highqual bright white 92 20lb paper work terrif laserjet printer paper realli becom expens day rememb could get ream dollar there probabl turn back set provid good cost per page offer good qualiti paper pack fantast ream wrap plastic seal wrap neatli done three ream come custom fit box exactli size paper keep box hold ream read use great wrap job ream simpli put ream bookshelf like book need that approach hard give high rate paper expens day tri object possibl variou option look factor ive examin white thick paper qualiti wrap cost one best ive come across defacto standard home print laser printer five star note cost paper make sure buy next printer print duplex ie side cut paper cost half cut wast weight half mani inexpens laser printer offer duplex make sure check purchas anoth laser printer

32949,4808,223,"I distinctly remember the yellow marker being lemon instead of banana, but ok.  The Mr. Sketch Scented Markers are the best smelling art/writing utensil out there.  Through my own childhood and prior experience as a camp counselor, I have yet to find a set of markers that actually smell really good and like the scent they are supposed to be.  The smell is not overwhelming, but rather pleasant.  There is no odorous marker smell like with Sharpies.  The colors are super vibrant.  12 markers are in the pack, which include the rainbow, i.e. Roy G. Biv.  Additionally, there two types of blue, pink, and green.  Also one brown and one black.

My son made me a picture of his Optimus Prime Transformer and it was the most colorful and cutest thing I've ever saw.  AND the paper smells good long after the ink dries.  For six bucks, you can't go wrong with this add-on item to introduce to your arts & crafts box.  One Caveat:  Beware when getting it your hands.  You'll have marker on your hand for at least the day.  These are not washable like Crayola, so make sure your child and you are wearing clothes that it's ok to get marked and messed up.  The ink also will come through paper, so make sure you have something underneath or you are coloring on a surface that you don't care about.

I have tried numerous pencil sharpeners, methods to sharpen them from the reviews I've read even watched a few youtube videos showing best way to sharpen them to no avail.

33008,4974,2582,"Please keep in mind that this is an extremely inexpensive fountain pen and not a high-end ""writing instrument."" That said, I really enjoy using this pen!

It's large enough to feel good in my (often sore) hand without being too bulky, and the smooth barrel gives me a good grip without feeling like it's either glued itself to my hand or is going to slip out from between my fingers.  Writing is nearly effortless, and the ink (I'm using black Parker Quink) flows freely without blotches or droplets regardless of whether I'm using the pen for 20 minutes at a time or make a couple of quick scribbles 48 hours apart.  Every now and then I wish it made a slightly finer line, but (even on Kraft paper) I've had no problems with bleedthrough or ""catching"" on the paper surface.  Even though it's listed as green marble in color, you need pretty strong light at just the right angle to clearly see the color -- but it's a handsome pen in any case, and I'm a lot more interested in how it writes than how brightly the barrel is colored! I've only filled it three times to date, but so far the supplied adapter has worked smoothly and holds enough ink for me to comfortably write multiple pages of (sloppy!) text.

The only negatives that come to mind are that the balance isn't quite right when the cap is ""posted"" on the back end of the barrel (it makes the pen noticeably tail-heavy, at least for my medium-sized hand) and my previously mentioned occasional wish for a finer line... neither of which is in any way a show-stopper.

 I bought this pen partly because of pleasant memories of using fountain pens years ago, and it's definitely brought back the joy of near-frictionless writing.",1525651200,5,plea keep mind extrem inexpens fountain pen highend write instrument said realli enjoy use pen larg enough feel good often sore hand without bulki smooth barrel give good grip without feel like either glu hand go slip finger write nearli effortless ink im use black parker quink flow freeli without blotch droplet regardless whether im use pen 20 minut time make coupl quick scribbl 48 hour apart everi wish made slightli finer line even kraft paper ive problem bleedthrough catch paper surfac even though list green marbl color need pretti strong light right angl clearli see color handsom pen case im lot interest write brightli barrel color ive fill three time date far suppli adapt work smoothli hold enough ink comfort write multipl page sloppi text neg come mind balanc isnt quit right cap post back end barrel make pen notic tailheavi least medium hand previous mention occasion wish finer line neither way showstopp bought pen partli pleasant memori use fountain pen year ago definit brought back joy

This phone is very substantial: solid in hand, heavy, just like the phones in the old days!

33117,5789,2926,"Gosh, these things are expensive. I hate every time I am required to order a new one. But for printing high-quality photos on Canon paper, these Canon inks can't be beaten. Color accuracy, operation, and the all-important ""end result"" makes these the item of choice whenever printing a high-quality image. I use mine on a Canon Pixma iX6820, and when I print in high-quality mode on Canon's best glossy or matte 13 x 19"" (A3+) papers, it still shocks me at just how good the results are. All inkjet prints will fade over time, particularly if you have the print in an area where sun or humidity are at play, but these genuine Canon inks will stand up over time more than off-brands. So, how do I handle the cost? I use third-party inks when printing handouts on plain paper for the office, but when printing photos, I stay with these Canon inks. In spite of the price, their superb, consistent performance make them a Five-Star item.

Note:
Please carefully note that this cartridge is the ""XL"" version of the 251 Y cartridge. They are both the exact same physical size and can be interchangeably used, but this one contains more ink than the standard 251 Y model. I don't know if this actually saves much on a per-page printing cost, but it does reduce the frequency with which you have to change cartridges.

But for printing high-quality photos on Canon paper, these Canon inks can't be beaten. Color accuracy, operation, and the all-important ""end result"" makes these the item of choice whenever printing a high-quality image. I use mine on a Canon Pixma iX6820, and when I print in high-quality mode on Canon's best glossy or matte 13 x 19"" (A3+) papers, it still shocks me at just how good the results are. All inkjet prints will fade over time, particularly if you have the print in an area where sun or humidity are at play, but these genuine Canon inks will stand up over time more than off-brands.

Noteand this is very importantthat this is the ""XL"" version of the cartridge. It is the same physical size as the CLI-251 C, but contains a higher quantity of ink than the standard cartridge. I try to purchase the ""XL"" versions whenever I can because of some increased (minor) economy, and the fact that the cartridge does not have to be exchanged quite so frequently.

33366,761,815,"After 9 months of use I can finally weigh in on this printer.  So far it's great.  After setting it up on my WiFi network and testing out the settings I was in business.  I run a small woodworking shop and etsy shop and was tired of print heads clogging and breaking down with the office all in one inkjet printer I had that stopped working.  With a laser printer you don't have the print head issue.  And toner lasts way longer than ink jet cartridges and are usually able to work fine with off brand toner.  So far after 9 months of printing invoices, envelopes, labels, receipts, business cards, coupons, product info cards, product labels, thank you cards, shipping labels, postage, and running 3 reams of paper through this thing I still am only down to 50% of the toner and with only a few jams and errors.

This will print 2 up shipping labels without them peeling apart and getting jammed in the machine.  It has pass through printing for the thicker card stock for product packaging and brochures.  It will do envelopes and mailer just fine.  It just works unlike every inkjet printer I've ever owned that give out after 2-3 years and are constantly cleaning the printing head.

So why 4 stars instead of 5?  2 things really.  The print quality is no where near what an inject printer will put out.  I mean I get good detail but the colors seem bland and there are times with the print looks fuzzy when I'm trying to print product labels in full color.  But it isn't bad.

The worst thing about this printer is it constantly falls asleep and you have to wake it up by pushing the pause button which then sometimes just pauses your print jobs.  Why does this happen.  I'm glad it saves energy but when I hit print on the computer I want it to wake up and do it's jobs.  I really think this is a software issue with Brother and could be fixed with an update.

I'm so glad I purchased this for my office.

33369,277,410,"I bought this set for a drawing class I was taking. It was nice to be exposed to these pencils, but I'm not sure I will use them very much and they were quite expensive. They are less waxy than regular colored pencils, and less chalky than pastel/chalk pencils, so I guess you could say they are kind of in the middle of both types. I was disappointed in the quality of the white drawing pencil. I wanted a white area that had good contrast to the black area next to it; with the drawing pencil the white just didn't stand out. I ended up using a white colored pencil over the drawing pencil and that gave me the contrast I was looking for. As a pencil they are very easy to use, the tips can be sharpened to a fine point, and can draw a fine line. They are easier to hold than the short rectangular sticks such as Conte crayons. The pencils come in a collection of muted colors which the label says would be perfect for landscapes and pictures of animals. I would have to add a few colored pencils with brighter colors but that is just my preference.",1525910400,4,bought set draw class take nice expo pencil im sure use much quit expens le waxi regular color pencil le chalki pastelchalk pencil guess could say kind middl type disappoint qualiti white draw pencil want white area good contrast black area next draw pencil white didnt stand end use white color pencil draw pencil gave contrast look pencil easi use tip sharpen fine point draw fine line easier hold short rectangular stick cont crayon pencil come collect mute color label say would perfect landscap pictur anim would add color pencil brighter color prefer

33387,5789,2617,"Gosh, these things are expensive. As I said in another review, I hate every time I am required to order a new one. But for printing high-quality photos on Canon paper, these Canon inks can't be beaten. Color accuracy, operation, and the all-important ""end result"" makes these the item of choice whenever printing a high-quality image, and the ""BK"" color is as important as the primary ink colors. I use mine on a Canon Pixma iX6820, a printer that uses two black cartridges, including this one, and when I print in high-quality mode on Canon's best glossy or matte 13 x 19"" (A3+) papers, it still shocks me at just how good the results are. All inkjet prints will fade over time, particularly if you have the print in an area where sun or humidity are at play, but these genuine Canon inks will stand up over time more than off-brands.

Noteand this is very importantthat this is the ""XL"" version of the cartridge. It is the same physical size as the CLI-251 BK, but contains a higher quantity of ink than the standard cartridge. I try to purchase the ""XL"" versions whenever I can because of some increased (minor) economy, and the fact that the cartridge does not have to be exchanged quite so frequently.

So, how do I handle the cost? I use third-party inks when printing handouts on plain paper for the office, but when printing photos, I stay with these Canon inks. In spite of the price, their superb, consistent performance make them a Five-Star item.",1525910400,5,gosh thing expens said anoth review hate everi time requir order new one print highqual photo canon paper canon ink cant beaten color accuraci oper allimport end result make item choic whenev print highqual imag bk color import primari ink color use mine canon pixma ix6820 printer use two black cartridg includ one print highqual mode canon best glossi matt 13 x 19 a3 paper still shock good result inkjet print fade time particularli print area sun humid play genuin canon ink stand time offbrand noteand importantthat xl version cartridg physic size cli251 bk contain higher quantiti ink standard cartridg tri purchas xl version whenev increas minor economi fact cartridg exchang quit frequent handl cost use thirdparti ink print handout plain paper offic print photo stay canon ink spite price superb consist perform make fivestar item
