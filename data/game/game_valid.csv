You get full per key rgb (which I wish was a little brighter), which I do admit, wasn't as good as my corsair keyboard, but it is only 40 dollars. The switches are Greentech Blues, which are just Cherry MX clones, which feel and sound almost exactly like Cherry MX Blues. The compact size is a key point and doesn't effect typing.

47514,410,4068,"Lets be honest hardcore survival horror games are infrequent in this day and age more so if you don't care for any other type of horror games. Survival horror is a special term one that was elevated by the creator of resident evil and now this game. He's back and he brings back his tried and true staple of the genre. Remember this genre has its roots in 90s so the structure and the mechanics will throw most players off at first but those who know their way of a few classic games of the genre will know the methods but will also be tested because this very much a old meets new type of game. Bringing classic survival horror in a modern gaming market so expect to see some ubiquitous things like checkpoints,player upgrades,weapon upgrading and full on dlc expansions.
Story for this game will throw people off its not well told and requires attention to detail of environments and letters and documents just to get a hint of the characters,motives and past events. The game uses warping a lot and this i feel takes away from the overall attachment to each environment. As the settings and monsters are the real highlight. Due note that the game is brutally gore some of the way your character dies will shock you. And the difficulty has spikes expect to die a lot in your first playthrough but every new playthrough after at most you'll be annoyed as the becomes more enjoyable when you know how to tackle situations that were once difficult.

47517,7699,3902,"First impressions well the Aesthetics aren't really my taste but that doesn't bother me when I'm wearing them. Material is all plastic that said they don't feel like they going to break after a few drops. The comfort levels are great cushion is soft they are light weigh so I forget I'm even wearing them, headband isn't the best tho it big enough for even the largest of heads but the material just doesn't feel to great but you do get used to it, clamping force is comfortable too it doesn't feel like ur heads getting crushes but enough to stay on your head. Sound quality leans toward the high side, highs being great mids coming out flat and lows good enough to give a lil punch but can become muddy if volume is to loud, the sound stage is very good determining where sound was coming from was never difficult. One thing that I'm really let down on is the Mic, the volume is really low and can hear background noise and a hint of static, using a USB sound card can help with all of that but you have to set the gain to the max  (also helps with sound) that being said testing the Mic on Skype and discord calls and game lobbies sounded fine with anyone's complaints is the background noise.

47542,4625,4465,"This is a really cool Xbox One controller!

1) It IS wired, so if you are looking to stick with wireless this is not for you.  However, with the features of this controller, the battery would die extremely quickly anyway.  The wire is long enough where it reaches my couch, but not my usual ""comfort"" spot.  So I would have to sit a little closer to the TV that I would like on my 70"" 4K HDR TV (minus 1 star).

2) The LED feature is really neat!  The center of the controller and the handles light up.  They are separate and can be controlled by the buttons on the back (top button for center, bottom for handles, and middle for the 3 brightness levels).  The first phases through every color available, the second pulses to different colors, and the rest are just the stable colors.  A not so ""red"" red, orange, and shades of green, blue and purple.  You can sync both sections together with good timing or have the to your specific customization.  Or if LED is not for you, too distracting for you or your significant other, you can simply turn the lights off.  I myself think it's a cool feature to keep on!  At least my wife will have something interesting to look at while I play Assassin's Creed...

3)  This controller simply feels VERY comfortable.  The buttons work well and it feels just like the quality of the Microsoft brand controllers!  It does not feel like the cheaper MadCatz of my teenage years.  It rumbles just like an original controller, has the microphone input.  It does it all!

So simply put, this is a wired Xbox One controller that feels and works up to par with the original controller with cool LED light features for a little less cost.

47552,4871,3480,"Not only the best Resident Evil game but also one of the best videogames of all time.

My time with RE4 before this was with the PS2 version, the worst of all ports based on visuals.  On PS4 the game looks and plays great at a constant 60 fps.  Modern third person shooting games allow movement and shooting at the same time.  RE4 does not do that so it may take time to adjust.  The game is structured in such a way that it plays very well after getting used to this gameplay mechanic.

It is not as scary as other Resident Evil games but still has its scary moments from time to time.  Another positive aspect of RE4 is the wide variety of enemies and levels.  This keeps the game from getting repetitive.  And that is important because this game will easily last 20 hours for the main game alone.  That does not include the extras lake Ada's game.

Final question is which versions of RE4 are worth it?  All of them of course!  In more detail:
Best: PS4, Xbox One, recent PC release (2014).  The consoles have slightly better textures but no anti-aliasing.
2nd: PS3, Xbox 360 run at 720p and 30 fps, still excellent
3rd: Wii runs at 480p and 30 fps.  Some people actually think this is the best port due to the wiimote shooting controls
Last: Gamecube, PS2, 2005 PC release.  Gamecube still looks great but excludes extras.  PS2 has the worst graphics of all ports and some slowdown.  The first PC port was botched, poor controls, graphics (although the graphics could be fixed with mods).

47573,5393,3924,"I recently purchased this game on the PSN as a digital download. Wow, this game is amazing!! The multiplayer is what most people are buying it for, and it's great. It's more robust and content filled than the original, and the controls are as good, or better than any FPS on the market. The frame rate is rock solid 60fps, and it helps because this game is crazy fast. One second your running on the side of a building, and flying through the air--the pilots are freakishly mobile. The next second your jumping in your Titan and wrecking the place, it's sooooo good. The single player campaign is, no joke, one of my favorite FPS campaigns, probably ever. It is incredible. It's got bits of Metroid prime, Bioshock, Mirrors Edge, and the film Pacific Rim, all wrapped in an amazing game and story that has you switching between on foot segments with a nice bit of platforming--it all works brilliantly--and sections in mechs where you take on bosses, and try different loadouts to perfect your character, it's really, really good.
For the ridiculously low price this game is selling for, everyone should buy it. You will easily get your money's worth.

47616,256,4455,"Like Saint's Row IV there's a lot of witty writing and banter between characters with a lot of references to pop and geek culture mixed with comic mischief

Instead of following one customized character. you can switch between dozens assembling a party of 3 to go on a mission at a time. I find this less personal as you're playing from a team perspective instead of a single character taking the lead. The narration, except for introduction of new character missions focus on the team instead of a single agent you are playing. The agent you select/switch off from the party of 3 gives off one liners at times given certain scenarios. There's barely any character development as you just get snippets of back story to go off of.

There's no open world to explore for the main story rather you go into a hub world to upgrade your stats/gear, and make purchases for your next mission. Each mission run from 5-15mins average depending on your skill level how much you upgrade your character. While playing through this game, I can't help but think this would go perfect on a handheld console like the Nintendo Switch due to its short mission structure.

There is an open world segment as you can explore the city of Seoul, but it's basically a territory gain mini-game where you have to take control legion bases scattered throughout the map. Unless you max out most of your characters it's almost impossible to take over all territories as once you take over a few, one that you captured already is regained by the enemy. Once you gain a territory, you can earn addition cash/exp through side quests within that territory

You unlock new characters through the main story or tackling side missions. Most new character you encounter have a better base stat and ability than your current party, so it encourages you to switch off, even though the newbie is of lower level.

All characters you encounter are unique in terms of personality (most be overly stereotypical), abilities, and play styles.
There's a lot of ways to upgrade your character stats though points from experience gained

There are 15 difficulty settings in the game each having different rewards upon completion. Depending on difficulty you set, you get different experience points and cash based on how fast you complete them. Thus you have to find a happy medium for advancement in this risk reward system

Graphics and style is very similar to Saints Row IV. Visuals are slightly better than SRIV, but not the best the PS4 can dish out. When there's a lot happening on screen, the frame rate may drop a bit (playing on the launch PS4). Menus have the iconic purple and white color scheme. Hand drawn cutscenes are a mixed bag and feels off at times due to the uneven lines in one scene and smooth line on the same character the next

Gameplay is your typical run-and-gun 3rd person shooter with a lot of random abilities mixed in like a special that makes a random AOE explosion around you, or one that de-buff enemy stats once they're in a certain range of you. Aiming is very generous in this game as you can land head shot fairly easily. You should be more focused on positioning than aiming due to it's fast paced nature. Most missions are basically the same and it get repetitive fast with the only motivation being to fully upgrade each character and listen in one their one liners

Story is your generic take over the world setup, but again the witty humor makes up for it.

Overall, if you want a variety of bit size missions instead of one epic tale in the tone of Saints Row IV, you should give this game a try",like saint row iv there lot witti write banter charact lot refer pop geek cultur mix comic mischief instead follow one custom charact switch dozen assembl parti 3 go mission time find le person your play team perspect instead singl charact take lead narrat except introduct new charact mission focu team instead singl agent play agent selectswitch parti 3 give one liner time given certain scenario there bare charact develop get snippet back stori go there open world explor main stori rather go hub world upgrad statsgear make purchas next mission mission run 515min averag depend skill level much upgrad charact play game cant help think would go perfect handheld consol like nintendo switch due short mission structur open world segment explor citi seoul basic territori gain minigam take control legion base scatter throughout map unless max charact almost imposs take territori take one captur alreadi regain enemi gain territori earn addit cashexp side quest within territori unlock new charact main stori tackl side mission new charact,1505520000,3

47716,4975,4320,"Every once and a while a game comes along that you realize once you play it, you've just played what will be considered a classic. Sometimes a game like this can make you mistakenly believe you actually enjoy a certain genre because it's just executed and done so well. For me those games are like a Zelda or a Final Fantasy. For the most part I can't stand those games as a series, but out them came classics that even I enjoy. Games like Zelda: A Link to the Past, and Final Fantasy X fit that description. Those are classics, but I've tried to play other games like them and I'm bored to death within minutes.

This game is an action/adventure RPG. I'm generally not a huge fan of this genre as a whole. Enough people I trust, though, said I should give this a shot. After purchasing and playing this game I tell you this game will stay in my collection until I die. The story is compelling. The acting is amazing. The gameplay is absolute perfection. Crafting is simple, easy, and actually makes sense! Saving is a breeze. Difficulty is hard enough. For those who demand a greater challenge, after beating the game you're given a new difficulty level to torture you with if you feel so inclined. I haven't cared about characters this much since playing games like Metal Gear Solid and the Mass Effect Trilogy.

If I had to gripe about this game it would be that it is so long, traveling the map can get cumbersome at times, and there are collectibles to get that really add no significant value to the game. There is a feature where you can fast travel around the map. Towards the end of the game I was doing this quite a bit. For me as a parent, I can't devote too much time to a game. So it took me quite a few months of off and on gameplay to beat this one. You can easily put around 60 to 70 hours into this game. That is more than enough. However, it was well worth it. That in itself is a testimate to how good this game really is. 10 hours give or take an hour is usually my breaking point. If I have to play any longer than that I usually move on to something else. This one, however, kept me engaged.

Side quests here, too, actually bring some depth to the story. I found myself actually wanting to finish these side quests. These also do quite a bit to help your character especially towards the end of the game.

I hate to say this, but even this game at the full price of $60, which it isn't anymore, is more than worth the asking price for this game. I always wait for things to go on sale or take advantage of the Prime pricing. I never pay $60 for a game. I only paid about 45 for this one, and it has been worth every penny. The creators of the Killzone series really outdid themselves here. Play this game. You more likely than not will not be disappointed.",everi game come along realiz play youv play consid classic sometim game like make mistakenli believ actual enjoy certain genr execut done well game like zelda final fantasi part cant stand game seri came classic even enjoy game like zelda link past final fantasi x fit descript classic ive tri play game like im bore death within minut game actionadventur rpg im gener huge fan genr whole enough peopl trust though said give shot purchas play game tell game stay collect die stori compel act amaz gameplay absolut perfect craft simpl easi actual make sen save breez difficulti hard enough demand greater challeng beat game your given new difficulti level tortur feel inclin havent care charact much sinc play game like metal gear solid mass effect trilog gripe game would long travel map get cumbersom time collect get realli add signific valu game featur fast travel around map toward end game,1505692800,5

The gameplay is also exceptional with good tight controls, interesting environments, a variety of weapons, double-jumps and wall-run maneuvers in the environment, and lots of features and options.  Very well-done game overall.
Also it doesn't take very long to respawn at the last checkpoint after I die.  Many games will take a long time loading the entire level or section, before you can resume playing after you die.  Not this one.  It's fast.
I'm now playing through a 2nd time in an attempt to get all the Pilot Helmets (collectibles) and I'm having nearly as much fun as I did the first time.

47791,5538,359,"I recalled hearing what a disaster GTA IV Online was and thanked myself for never going there, but rather creating my own Multi Theft Auto San Andreas, IV Multiplayer, and Five M servers that were 100% enjoyable all the time. I worked night and day on them for years, learning Lua, Squirrel, and JavaScript in the process of building them for the endless enjoyment tens of thousand of players who've visited them have shared in return for all my free labor over the past five years. Grand Theft Auto V, costing $250 million USD to make has sold 75 million units with a true cost of just under $4 per unit earning $4,750,000,000 in gross profit.

Grand Theft Auto Online has a couple of good things that sometimes work right, and can be down right amazing to play. Everything else about GTAO is otherwise broken.

The greatest and most easily fixable flaw in the GTAO experience is loading... Load times are 5-15 times as long as they should be, meaning what should take 15 seconds, can take 2-4 minutes, and that is if it hasn't crashed entirely. You will never know which is true. Until you've sat at a loading screen for 10 minutes only to conclude it is never going to load ever. Unlike the last screen you sat at for 9 minutes that did finally load. 50% of your time in GTAO will be thrown away waiting for things to load. It goes through a ridiculous amount of world loading even when it is not at all needed. I have built GTA V servers for GTA-MP, FiveMP, RageMP, and FiveM. It was shocking how horrible the load times of GTAO were. If GTAO were a single server on any of those systems, there would be no one using it. (7mb DSL, USA capable of loading 60GB a day)

The second worst part of the GTAO experience is the missions. I have written a dozen GTA missions on my various servers and wish it were a hundred missions because that is what writing a dozen good missions feels like. A mission must be written and rewritten and rerewritten, debugged, redebugged, and reredebugged. The GTA V single players missions all worked perfectly for me which is additionally why the online missions were so surprising. They were absolutely the worst GTA missions you have ever seen from any game. Worthy of a Vice City Redux perhaps. Go from point A to point B to shoot fish in a barrel. Made difficult only by the addition of team players who are always the worst players you've ever met. In addition to the missions being totally buggy. Vehicles that won't move being their most frequent flaw. I ran one mission over and over for 3 hours. It was maybe a 5 minute mission. Still haven't beaten it. Never died once.

The GTAO Youtube videos are all a poorly conceived tapestry of holywood lies. GTAO is a 500 million dollar ""sharkcard"" scam for profit. None of what they depict in the videos is available in GTAO the way they depict it. There is no community to speak of. There is no enjoyment to be had from it. There is nothing but misery, horror, and the worst socio-political indoctrination you have ever imagined from their ""unrated"" online content of the missions' dialog, the likes of which you couldn't find if you spent all day everyday on a drug binging biker hangout tour of the worst ghettos in the world during the post-apocalypse.

GTAO is the lowest common denominator theory in action, cashing in on a deader than dead franchise. If ever you enjoyed the miracle that was GTA III, the experience that was San Andreas or even the scatterbrained IV... run from this game and anything that follows at full speed. Grand Theft Auto is dead. Rockstar is dead. Take2 has taken enough. But don't believe my proclamation that they are a dead franchise since San Andreas and Red Dead. Buy it for yourself and see. It is the only way you will learn. You are a brainless cash machine and they have no daily limit.

Some minor criticisms:
- As others mentioned, the cord can be annoying attached to the headset. Speaking of which, there are a LOT of cords with this system.
- Don't expect the graphics to blow you away especially you've been using a PS4 Pro w/4k TV like myself (it's realistic enough but nowhere near the resolution or clarity of 4k gaming)

So as long as you don't forget to drop it in the cradle after finishing you will be good to go.

47841,4871,627,"Pros: great graphics, variety of gameplay, voice acting, amount of content
Cons: hard to follow story, gameplay seriously flawed, controls

First off it is easy to see why RE fans would not like this game.  Much of it plays like Gears of War or Call of Duty.  Those are fine games but if that is not what you want you would be unsatisfied.

Graphics are really good and framerate is great.  The voice acting is above video game standards.  There are multiple characters to play the game with, resulting in many hours of play.  I did not play it on previous consoles but apparently they added the dlc in this version, nice.

However, the game has lots of serious, serious flaws.
*can't pause game unless playing offline, and game selects online by default
*game does not pause when mixing healing items or switching weapons
*game controls are difficult to use and poorly explained.  Examples: qte circling actions with analog sticks are meant to be done with both sticks, not just one.  Tip: change the aiming icon to laser sight like in RE4 to make aiming easier (they should have enabled this by default).
*because the game storyline is told from multiple characters, it is really confusing.  I ended up finding a faq online tellilng me which order to play the chapters in order to make sense of the story.

Another example of flawed gameplay: on one level you are running down a train track and a train comes suddenly.  You are supposed to hit a few buttons as a qte event to avoid the train.  Thing is that I was not on the track at the time so the train should not have hit me.  Obviously the developers were forcing the qte event even though it did not make any sense given what was happening onscreen.

Another problem: zombies are bullet sponges.  Which is fine except that sometimes I found them not taking damage when shooting again after stunning them.  Or perhaps the animations were not there for multiple gunshots.  Either way it detracts from the game.

In the end this is a controversial game that some will love and others will hate.  As of Sept 2017 you can get it for a cheap price.  At discount probably worth a buy as long as you are aware of its many flaws.",pro great graphic varieti gameplay voic act amount content con hard follow stori gameplay serious flaw control first easi see fan would like game much play like gear war call duti fine game want would unsatisfi graphic realli good framer great voic act video game standard multipl charact play game result mani hour play play previou consol appar ad dlc version nice howev game lot seriou seriou flaw cant paus game unless play offlin game select onlin default game paus mix heal item switch weapon game control difficult use poorli explain exampl qte circl action analog stick meant done stick one tip chang aim icon laser sight like re4 make aim easier enabl default game storylin told multipl charact realli confus end find faq onlin tellilng order play chapter order make sen stori anoth exampl flaw gameplay one level run train track train come suddenli suppos hit button qte event avoid train thing track time train hit obvious develop forc qte event even though make,1505952000,3

47878,2534,1922,"First things first. If you're not very good at driving vehicles in video games, then don't even bother picking this one up because it's just going to frustrate you and probably give you a headache. Only get this game if you're a fan of the series, enjoy tough challenges and have tons of patience. I bought this game since I have already had the other 2 Driver games for the Playstation. It's the same concept as the previous titles, except this one adds the element of a 3rd person shooter, so in a way, it's sort of similar to that of a GTA game, though watered down some.

The graphics are pretty decent. Most if not every vehicle in this game handles differently, including acceleration, speed and steering. This is where some of the difficulty comes in, so make sure to go to the ""Take A Ride"" mode and get yourself familiar with all of the vehicles, because you're going to be using a lot of them throughout the entire game. The vehicles in this game range from sports cars, to big rigs, to boats and a lot others. The on foot controls are alright, though some of the buttons do seem like they have a split second delay on them. Just like the other 2 games, you play as the undercover cop Tanner, working for the bad guys to get info on whats going on. The entire game takes place in 3 different locations. Miami, Florida. Nice, France. And Istanbul, Turkey. Each location has their own set of vehicles, so you won't find the same vehicle in each location.

Most of the missions consists of driving from point A to point B. Other missions include tailgating and chases. And lastly are the on foot missions. The on foot missions are fairly easy. Most of them just require you to simply shoot your way to the end of the mission while others have you interact with buttons, cranes, etc. Though some of the on foot missions do have driving strung together on them, so it's almost like 2 missions inside 1 whole mission. If you die or fail at any point during most of these missions, you have to start from the very beginning of the mission, though some missions are actually nice enough to give you checkpoints so that you don't have to redo the whole thing over again just to get to the part where you died or failed.

The point A to point B and tailgate missions are fairly easy as well. Some of the point A to point B missions have a set time limit. The tailgate missions just consist of following enemy vehicles around the map until they get to their destination all while making sure to keep an eye on your detection meter. If you stray too far away, you'll lose sight of the vehicle and if you get too close, the enemy will become suspicious, both resulting in a failed mission. I personally find this to be kind of annoying since you have a radar in the corner of the screen that shows you where the enemy vehicle is, even if your kind of far away from them. Nonetheless, all of the enemy vehicles go somewhat slow during these missions and they all take the same route during every playthrough, so it's really not that hard to get past these segments.

The chase missions are the toughest missions in the entire game. Your objective in these missions is to chase down the enemy vehicle that is trying to escape, most of which usually always ends up in a shoot out at the end. Sometimes you will be required to shoot at the enemy vehicles while driving. What makes these missions tough is that you must keep up with the enemy vehicle throughout the entire chase mission. If you're too slow going around a turn or if you end up wrecking into an object that can stop you dead in your tracks, 9 times out of 10, the enemy will end up getting away, resulting in a failed mission. However, it is possible to catch up to the enemy vehicle if you happen to wreck or go too slow around a turn, but like I said, the chances of that happening are very slim. You can't really memorize the patterns either because for most of the chase missions, the enemy vehicle will always take a different route. The only mission that I've found where the enemy vehicle takes the same route during every playthrough was the very last chase mission in the game.

If you're really good at driving games, want a challenge or just like the Driver series, then pick this one up.",first thing first your good drive vehicl video game dont even bother pick one go frustrat probabl give headach get game your fan seri enjoy tough challeng ton patienc bought game sinc alreadi 2 driver game playstat concept previou titl except one add element 3rd person shooter way sort similar gta game though water graphic pretti decent everi vehicl game handl differ includ acceler speed steer difficulti come make sure go take ride mode get familiar vehicl your go use lot throughout entir game vehicl game rang sport car big rig boat lot other foot control alright though button seem like split second delay like 2 game play undercov cop tanner work bad guy get info what go entir game take place 3 differ locat miami florida nice franc istanbul turkey locat set vehicl wont find vehicl locat mission consist drive point point b mission includ tailgat chase lastli foot mission foot mission,1505952000,4
47879,2534,2876,"I bought this little gem many years ago at a local game store back when the PS2 was still in it's prime. It was one of the best purchases that I've ever made for my PS2. I'm not sure which version mine is. All I know is that it's the yellow disc that says ""Get More Game"" on it. I also have a Gameshark 2 version 3, but nothing can compare to the Codebreakers disc. The interface is easier to use, and all of the cheats for the games work, unlike with the Gameshark 2, the games tend to freeze a lot when I activate a cheat from it. It just really sucks that you have to manually put in the codes now instead of just downloading them on to your memory card from the Codebreakers servers since the servers shut down. Anyways, I'm the type of gamer that loves playing video games, but in a world where there are thousands upon thousands of games, I hate wasting a bunch of time on one level or one game that I'm unable to get past. I just want to enjoy the main story of the game while getting the most out of what the game has to offer and then move on to the next game. Too many games, not enough time to play them all. But, thanks to Codebreakers, this disc has helped me get through some of the tougher parts of some games as well as made a lot of games replayable for me because of the amount of things that you can do in a game when you have cheats activated. It literally becomes a whole different ball game. Explore restricted areas, become invincible, take down a whole army of enemies, unlock every unlockable in a game, and modify the game to your liking by swapping character skins and making the AI stand there as if nothing is happening.

47919,2529,3783,"two reasons why i choose two stars one is this isn't much of a celebration since this is a reboot and doesn't have any of original characters and gameplay formula also lara is too much of a cry baby it's what nintendo did to metroid when they changed and ruined samus my other reason is how over emotional they made lara compared to when core design originally made her to be as well as tomb raider games i grew up playing and for the fact that these reboots are having a higher rating than any of the originals is a insult and i forgot to mention  u cant explore the mansion/ croft minor  like  every other tr game b4 the reboot even tho they show lara in croft minor in the story mode
my thoughts ""Upon release, Rise of the Tomb Raider was critically acclaimed, with critics praising its graphics, gameplay, and characterization.'' not because of storytelling which is average. i ppl are just too focus on graphics and realism and not storytelling which all of the originals even that other reboot ""underworld"" when square enix took over from core design after their failures with angel of darkness and the creator of lara croft Toby Gard distances himself from tomb raider franchise once tr gain alot of popularity to the point that ppl wanted to change his creation without talking to him first but thats another story away

now as far as the story *SPOILERS
 ""it begins at full speed, with protagonist Lara Croft and Jonah, one of her companions from the last game, journeying into the frigid mountains of Siberia. Through some flashbacks  both in cutscene and playable form  we learn that Lara is on the trail of an artifact and a lost city, two myths that her father swore were real before a tragic death. As the adventure progresses, Lara finds herself up against Trinity, a shadowy organization looking for the same historical discoveries for more malevolent purposes. Lara ignores her and organises an expedition to Syria, hoping to uncover the tomb of the Prophet of Constantinople, a key figure in the legend of Kitezh. Although successful, the tomb is empty, and Lara is interrupted by Trinityan ancient order of knights that now exists as a paramilitary organization investigating the supernaturaland their leader Konstantin. As she flees, Lara discovers a symbol etched into the tomb that she links to a book on Russian religious history in her father's study. A Trinity assassin steals the book, prompting Lara and her friend Jonah to give chase in Siberia. When the two are separated after an avalanche, Lara is forced to go on alone.

Lara discovers that Trinity has taken over a Soviet-era mining installation as a base of operations in the search for Kitezh. She is caught attempting to retrieve the book and placed in a prison cell with Ana. Konstantin forces Lara to reveal what she knows by slowly strangling Ana in front of her, but Lara is unable to tell anything of use. Ana then reveals herself to be Konstantin's sister and Trinity's spy who has been manipulating her father. The two interrogate her as to the whereabouts of the ""Divine Source"", an artifact believed to grant immortality. Lara escapes, and in the process aids Jacob, a mysterious stranger who leads her through the mines into the valley beyond. Jacob is revealed to be the leader of the Remnant, the descendants of the followers of the Prophet of Constantinople. As Lara aids in their resistance against Trinity, she begins to learn more about the deathless Prophet and the lost city of Kitezh. After being branded a heretic and pursued by the Order of Trinity, the Prophet and his followers resettled in Russia, where they built Kitezh. However, spurred on by agents of Trinity, the Mongol Hordes led by Genghis Khan attacked the city, and the Prophet was forced to sacrifice it to protect the Divine Source. The Remnant escaped and settled in the area, vowing to defend the city's secret. Jacob warns her that although the Divine Source exists, it is not what she expects it to be. Konstantin's forces repeatedly attack the Remnant, believing them to be heretics and justifying the slaughter as God's will. However, Lara discovers that Ana is dying and has been manipulating her brother to find the Divine Source and save her.
Jacob and Lara decide that the only way to protect the Divine Source is to retrieve it before Trinity can. In order to do this, Lara recovers the Atlas, an artifact that serves as a map of Kitezh. She is reunited with Jonah, who has been spying on Trinity forces, and they locate the path into the city. However, Konstantin has been aware of Jonah's presence and let him go free in the hopes that he would lead them to Lara. Trinity then attacks and take Jonah and the Atlas. Lara goes after Trinity and tries to rescue Jonah, but before she can free him, Konstantin stabs him and escapes. Lara takes Jonah to Jacob, who miraculously heals Jonah. Jacob then admits that he is the deathless Prophet himself. With Trinity advancing on the glacier that rests over Kitezh, Lara is forced to enter the city through the Path of the Deathless where she encounters the Deathless Ones, the immortal guardians of the city. Following the journals of a Trinity agent embedded in the Mongolian forces, Lara realizes the truth of Jacob's warning: the Divine Source grants immortality to the person who beholds it at the cost of their sense of self, and the Deathless Ones are the hollow immortal inhabitants of Kitezh who no longer know anything else but defending the city. As Lara enters Kitezh, the Remnant rally to attack the Deathless Ones, giving her time to reach the heart of the city. She encounters Konstantin blocking the path and mortally wounds him; he dies in disbelief that he was not carrying out God's will, but Ana's. Before his death, he claims that Lara's father did not commit suicide, but was in fact murdered by Trinity. Lara is too late to stop Ana from retrieving the Divine Source, a large glowing crystal, but wrests it from her before Ana can use it. Lara then smashes the Divine Source, killing the Deathless Ones and taking away Jacob's immortality. However, he is happy that his death has finally come and thanks Lara for bringing his end as he peacefully disintegrates. In the aftermath, Jacob's daughter Sofia takes over the Remnant. Jonah recovers from his wounds and joins Lara in planning their next expedition, with Lara vowing to investigate more of the world's mysteries as well as thwart Trinity's plans. A post-credits scene shows Lara and Ana leaving Russia, two weeks before Lara returned to the manor. Lara confronts Ana about whether Ana killed her father. Ana denies it, despite admitting that Trinity gave her the order. Before she can reveal anything else, a sniper shot hits Ana, killing her instantly. The sniper asks his unseen superior about killing Lara, but is told to stand down for the time being.""

to me this doesn't feel like tomb raider anymore
with elements that make this game as a combined copy of uncharted with things such as crafting and upgrade system & Tedious resource gathering and over dramatic sequences  also online co-op/ mutiplayer is also average bcuz not only your character die way to fast and there's not health meter to me it lacks just like that 2013 reboot i really don't care for graphics as much as new gamers but i do look for advance gameplay and this game and that other reboot doesn't have that at all and all the reasons why i used to love lara and tom raider games in the first place The best parts of Rise of the Tomb Raider's optional content are the tombs themselves.  Some fans were bothered by how the 2013 reboot featured very few tombs, temples and other similar archaeological discoveries, and how it forced them into side areas. That latter issue hasn't changed, but there must be over a dozen of these optional tombs now., and the puzzles they task you with solving are wonderfully designed. with a lot of difficulty
 Rise of the Tomb Raider has also greatly expanded the crafting system from the previous game. Lara can now craft a number of different types of ammunition on the fly,(not unlimited like any of the originals) while choosing from bigger upgrades to her arsenal of weapons at base camps. The resource system feels a little loosely implemented
WRAP UP:
RISE OF THE TOMB RAIDER EXECUTES THE FRANCHISE FORMULA WITH CONFIDENCE sort of but
In many ways, could be viewed as a fairly modest sequel. It successfully builds off Crystal Dynamics' unnecessary reboot, but it does introduce massive changes spitting distance of the previous games including lara main weapon that was substituted with a bow instead of two pistols",two reason choos two star one isnt much celebr sinc reboot doesnt origin charact gameplay formula also lara much cri babi nintendo metroid chang ruin samu reason emot made lara compar core design origin made well tomb raider game grew play fact reboot higher rate origin insult forgot mention u cant explor mansion croft minor like everi tr game b4 reboot even tho show lara croft minor stori mode thought upon releas rise tomb raider critic acclaim critic prais graphic gameplay character storytel averag ppl focu graphic realism storytel origin even reboot underworld squar enix took core design failur angel dark creator lara croft tobi gard distanc tomb raider franchis tr gain alot popular point ppl want chang creation without talk first that anoth stori away far stori spoiler begin full speed protagonist lara croft jonah one companion last game journey frigid mountain siberia flashback cutscen playabl form learn lara trail artifact lost citi two myth father,1506038400,2

Assembly is a snap, as the blocks basically go together like building blocks. You can customize it, if you wish, although I think the standard end level design is what most people will go with.

* Better atmospheric lighting and more detailed shadows.

It fixes a lot of things about SMT IV that were turn-offs to long time fans of the series and is a sequel to the game, not a remix or re-imagining of SMT IV.

The music is top-notch, especially because Shoji Meguro isn't involved (finally!) and Persona veteran Kenichi Tsuchiya is amongst the composers. It's a different sound from the original Persona games, but it's still great and lacks all of the repetitive musical tropes and tired J-Pop appeal Meguro relies on too heavily in his later work. The voice acting is also superb, not a single character has a unexceptional delivery.

Battles are fast-paced which offsets the high encounter rate, though you can see enemies and outrun them when needed. The plot is interesting and has a lot of twists and turns, and the character development is pretty good. There's a lot of new faces in the game, but they are all unique and interesting. It's a moderately long game and you definitely will put some serious time into it.

The graphics are a mixed bag; the backgrounds and 3D chacter/demon models are very well made. The demon portraits were made by several different artists and one of them is absolutely terrible, so it's jarring to cycle through your demon roster and see very impressive illustrations and then some amateur ones. Some of the background objects like trees and bushes have a bizarrely low polygon count and look like something from an original Playstation game. On the whole it's all above average, however, just a few things stick out.

Like all modern Atlus games the translation is well done but rife with spelling and grammatical errors. For some reason both Atlus and Aksys Games steadfastly refuse to proof-read their work.

I'd highly recommend this game to any SMT fans, especially those of you enjoyed Strange Journey and Soul Hackers. It's fine return to form and shows that Atlus can still make good games for hardcore fans even if they also have to churn out garbage like Persona 3 and 4 for casual gamers to make money.",smt iv apocalyps fantast like earlier smt game like soul hacker youll feel right home one fix lot thing smt iv turnoff long time fan seri sequel game remix reimagin smt iv music topnotch especi shoji meguro isnt involv final persona veteran kenichi tsuchiya amongst compos differ sound origin persona game still great lack repetit music trope tire jpop appeal meguro reli heavili later work voic act also superb singl charact unexcept deliveri battl fastpac offset high encount rate though see enemi outrun need plot interest lot twist turn charact develop pretti good there lot new face game uniqu interest moder long game definit put seriou time graphic mix bag background 3d chacterdemon model well made demon portrait made sever differ artist one absolut terribl jar cycl demon roster see impress illustr amateur one background object like tree bush bizarr low polygon count look like someth origin playstat game whole averag howev thing stick like modern atlu game translat well done rife spell grammat error,1506124800,5

the microphone sounds passable; usable, but i wouldn't record or track any music with it or anything.

48041,2641,2004,"Finally played it many, many years after release.

I completely feel like both 13-2 and LR ruined the good memories of FF13 for me.

LR plays drastically different than the other two (new combat system, new gameplay).  It's got a time/day limit that I've been told is similar to Zelda Majora's Mask - I do not like games that have time limits. Overall gameplay is pretty good, they kinda forced a difficulty spike to encourage multiple replays.  Side quests are not optional.  Story is cheesy.

I didn't absolutely hate it, but I feel incredibly ambivalent toward this game.  I'm hard pressed to give any positives (not even music, at least 13-2 had really good music).  I didn't absolutely hate this game, but while it was okay when I played it, I left the game with an overall negative feeling/impression.

At the end of the day, I definitely feel like the sequels ruined the original for me.  Now that I'm done with these two, I plan to pretend they don't exist in the FF13 timeline lol.

If you liked FF13 a lot, I'd say skip the sequels so they don't ruin the original story and characters.

If you liked FF13 but specifically hated just the linearity - try 13-2 and/or LR

If you liked FF13 but specifically hated the paradigm shift combat system - try LR

i have never owned any form of x box so my chance to play any doa game has been limited to just doa2 on ps2
 but doa5 blows 2 away. its fun because now they have brought in new characters from ninja gaiden like rachel and moiji as well as virtua fighter characters pai, akira ,sarah and jacky bryant. the game play is very good.
i don't play online much but you have the option to do so. the story mode was ok
though instead of the old formula of picking one fighter and playing through to the end you are given a character for so many chapters
before you are switched to the next. my problem is that im often given a charter im not good with and forced to use them.
for example i love christie and use her a lot but then im made to play as rig or brad wong (oh i hate brad wong but thats just me not being good at drunken master style) i do think that this game does feel like real martial arts in that you have to train and practice to get truly good with your chosen character you also have a ton of unlockable costumes not includign paid dlc. the game also features tag modes such as normal tag tag survival and time attak tag as well as single equivalents and team battles where you pick 7 (i think) characters and just battle until only your team is left standing. its well worth picking up this game i don't really have any negatives to say about it.",could sworn wrote review alreadi well anyway never own form x box chanc play doa game limit doa2 ps2 doa5 blow 2 away fun brought new charact ninja gaiden like rachel moiji well virtua fighter charact pai akira sarah jacki bryant game play good dont play onlin much option stori mode ok though instead old formula pick one fighter play end given charact mani chapter switch next problem im often given charter im good forc use exampl love christi use lot im made play rig brad wong oh hate brad wong that good drunken master style think game feel like real martial art train practic get truli good chosen charact also ton unlock costum includign paid dlc game also featur tag mode normal tag tag surviv time attak tag well singl equival team battl pick 7 think charact battl team left stand well worth pick game dont realli neg say,1506384000,5

48064,8688,220,"Ok look, it's NOT as bad as the reviews make it seem like. Glitches and bugs? Yes there were plenty, but the update completely fixes it! Combat sucks? I don't see that at all. I actually thought it's a nice improvement with all the new moves, and they made the fight more realistic as well. And let's face it, that finishing stab is the coolest I've seen since Revelations. Storyline? I thought it's pretty engaging, especially with the adorable girlfriend (not trying to spoil anything), maybe still a little cliche (cuz it's always that revenge story), but that doesn't take away the fun. And let's face it, the graphics is just hands down amazing!! The amount of details, the scenery, the people and everything, is just amazing. Great job Ubisoft.

BUT of course it's not perfect. My problem with it, however, is the fact that LITERALLY EVERY MISSION IS THE SAME. Basically, every single mission is to ""infiltrate this place and kill that person."" It gets so boring after like 10 of those!!

But overall I thought it's a pretty decent game, and definitely lived up to the AC standard.

48069,1590,4402,"Prey is a reboot no one asked for, and it has nothing to do with the original 2006 game (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prey-Xbox-360/dp/B000C427NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prey - Xbox 360</a>). I really liked the Native American / alien abduction aspect of the original, but sadly, that's all done away with. The new Prey has many problems. It's basically BioShock in space, from the over-used art-deco visual motifs down to the way ""neuromods"" are injected into your body (skills/abilities).

The game map itself is very small, taking place entirely on a space station, which has about 12 sections. To get from one section to the next, you have to suffer a 1-2 minute load time. If you play this game from start to finish, you will literally waste several hours of your life on load screens. This is absolutely the worst aspect of the game, and possibly a limitation of the CryEngine. It really takes you out of the experience, and I dreaded having to go through a door. Compare this to Zero Dawn Horizon, which is free roam and open world, with no load times.

Most rooms and computer terminals are initially locked and you have to find the corresponding keycard or password in another part of the station to progress. So typical gameplay is, go to one section of the station, find the card/code then go back to the other part of the station. You will have to travel back and forth between sections many times. Some locks require hacking to open, which you can do once you've acquired the right hacking skill level. Hacking an item opens a timed maze mini-game. Get the cursor into the target and avoid the walls of the maze, which shock and slow you down. Some doors absolutely require the appropriate card to open and are not hackable.

The weapons are very limited, underpowered, and lame: shotgun, Gloo gun (shoots incapacitating foam), stun gun, pistol, wrench, etc. The game is set in 2032 which is not that far in the future, but really, some better, more original weapons would've been more fun. I ended up using the wrench most of the game because most of the weapons were useless. The pistol, for example, does a paltry 12 damage! 12!

Enemy design is also very limited. You'll see only about a dozen different kinds of aliens, which either float, scuttle, or are bipedal. There's not much variation. One aspect of the game I did enjoy was the materials recycler, but maybe that's because of my OCD. Put unwanted items in the bin and convert them to basic materials cubes, which can be fed into a Fabricator to make items/weapons/upgrades.

I finished the game, out of nothing more than pure stubbornness. I wish I hadn't. The ending is extremely unsatisfying. I won't spoil it for you, but it's really disappointing and made me feel even worse about wasting many hours on the game. It's a bit disingenuous to have spent so much time playing to find out that the ending is what it is, and that your actions have no consequence. If you rescue crew, there's no reward at the end. You are also lied to. One of the objectives in a side mission is to ""escape Talos I"". If you complete the step, the game immediately ends with a voiceover!

48105,3773,843,"Hands down one of the best RGB Keyboards ever.

My last true 16.8 Million color RGB keyboard was a Blackwidow Chroma 2014 with their clicky Kailh switches. They felt okay, but they were very loose and mushy. Not to mention the spacebar wire broke after 5 months of use. This Strafe has Cherry MX Brown switches and they feel and sound amazing. When it comes to switch quality, look no further than Corsair.

The design is slightly different than the Corsair K70. This keyboard is made of strong plastic, which does NOT pick up finger prints! (thank god.) The cable is not braided, the switches are not exposed like the K70. For example, the K70's design is more similar to the Blackwidow X While the Strafe has a similar design to the regular Blackwidow Chroma with a white back-plate. Oh, and there is no volume wheel, but you can change the volume using FN + F5, F6 Or F7, so you still have volume control. The overall design is very nice. You also have a USB Pass through as well, which is nice. The RGB Version comes with a wrist rest, which is nice considering how the original strafe does not include one. However, I don't find it as comfortable as the one that comes with the K70 Lux non-rgb. But I won't let a wrist rest affect my final verdict.

Finally, the lighting. The lighting on this keyboard is beautiful. This keyboard has a white back-plate which makes the colors look brighter and more vibrant. Each key is individually backlit so you can change the color each key without it affecting others. On the sides of the keyboard you have the light strips, but from as far as I know they only stay white, it would be nice if could change the color of them like on the K95 Platinum.

Finally, the software. CUE Has gotten easier to use over the years. It's pretty easy to use now if you don't have ""advanced mode"" turned on in the software. Once you know how to use the software is when you realize how powerful this keyboard can be.

So, would I recommend it? YES!

I'd say the extras are worth the price. As for the game itself, which I didn't factor into my stars, I'm a huge Mega Man fan and I'd consider this game average for that realm. It's not Mega Man 2 or 3, but it's not X7 either (imo one of the worst). If you're looking for something better in the retro platforming genre, Mighty Gunvolt Burst is a much better game(and a great game period), and as I've heard stated many times, what Mighty No. 9 should have been.

Of course, it is not like the old school games, Resident Evil 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 but I like the fact that Capcom makes different styles of Resident Evil games because I'm a big fan of the Franchise. Resident Evil 5 is more action packed than scary but I still get to shoot and kill zombies and mutated monsters. And I like having my partner with me too. She can hold stuff and we can swap and give things to one another. When I finish this one, I'm gonna get Resident Evil 6, because I didn't get a chance to play Resident Evil 5 or 6 on the consoles, (XBOX 360 and PlayStation 3) before the present consoles. So, it's new to me. And the graphics are really good but I find the tone of color odd.

To the movies. They never made a Resident Evil movie that's like the old school Resident Evil games 0-4, which would be pretty cool. But with Resident 5, they may have finally made a video game that's similar to the movies. RE 5's story may be different from the movies but it is action-packed just like the movies. I happen to like the movies too. So maybe... That is why I like RE5 and I can see why it is compared to ""Dead Rising 2.""

I have had the Logitech G29, which I would consider as a children's toy, then moved to the Thrustmaster T300 which broke after a year.  Then bought another T300 before getting this one.  This is a step up from the T300.  I do hope Thrustmaster is not giving up on their new direct drive wheel because that is the future of sim racing.

I thought maybe I got a bad set so I als replaced it with an OEM set... Bad idea. This ones right grip warped as well in Aug. Which now I decided to replace with the set by Scuf. *crosses fingers*. Other than that this controller is nice though. The trigger stops, extra paddles, and button customization in settings are awesome.

 So if your ready to spend 150+ on the controller plus 25 for replacement grips plus another 5-10 for bumpers. More power to you. Just remember this controller is not Elite.

It takes you through all of the major arcs up through Dressrosa (which has an improvised ending because the arc was not complete by the time this game was finished; for reference, there is no gear 4th in this game). You plow through the story putting down hundreds of enemies per stage with unique abilities and character strategies. When you finish story mode (which you will likely never tire of reliving), there is an exhaustive challenge mode where you take on dozens of various stages. The biggest drag of this game is that characters have to have ""level breaks"" to get past level 50. Definitely buy this game if you are a One Piece fan.

I've seen the numerous videos supporting the Steam Controller. How it can be more accurate than a traditional X Box pad. For me personally, the discomfort was just too great. The track pad was just never accurate for me, no matter how much i tweaked it, the fact that i have to center my thumbs constantly on a flat pad made it hell for FPS, and for the much advertised Point and Click games that it works with? It....does work. But i always found myself reaching for a mouse.

Other reviews have said this the best. The Steam controller is an enabler. It makes games like RTS's that are impossible on the gamepad possible. Whether or not you WANT that feature, at the cost of comfort, is up to you.

The story is pretty short though, but it's fairly interesting. There are several difficulty levels to play this game on, so if it seems too easy--you can easily turn up the challenge. Enemy A.I. is pretty predictable, and you can deal with enemies fairly well when you have cover.

The online community for this game is absolutely positively DEAD. If you're expecting to play any online content whatsoever, forget about it. I've literally waited for hours in a lobby hoping players would join me, and it never happened. There's no interest in this game by players it seems, so be warned--especially if you're going for the online trophies; You'll need a friend to help boost you.

Overall this is a good game, and I'm glad that I played it. However, there's just no replayability in this title after you finish it. It took me about 6 hours to complete the single player campaign, and I spend about another 12 more hours on/off trying to find a person to play with online--which is futile at this point.

If you save and quit, you restart the game, but tell the little dog you need help with something first. It will give you a option to change the date and time.

Second instinct is to go to the door and I forgot to get the keys.  Try to investigate around the area and he saw me and again, I die.  Notice the keys were right near him on the hook, grab the keys and proceed forward but, he noticed I was gone, look for me, cut my leg and lord and behold, I survive.  However, while is a medic room, the bizarre killer wanted to kill me with high intensity and he was blocking my next exit.  I decided to hide in the lockers for awhile, he came around the lockers, turn on the chainsaw and kill me.  I try to pass him quickly but he saw me and kill me.  I sneak around him, pick up a clue and before I can walk forward, I turn around, he was there and kill me.  I sneak past him again, went through the door to the next room that was full of sharp, chainsaw-like machines on the left and right side of the wall that will kill me instantly with a cut leg, move forward, he found me, turn on the room's mechanics to activate the chainsaw walls, barely escape, was in a room of blood and more corpses, found the stairs where the end of the hallway, lead an elevator and walking towards it, he found me again and I was sprinting with a cut leg and I made it but I thought I was about to die again because he was chainsawing the bars again (and the bars look rusted) but luckily, the elevator started going down.

A little while into the game you do unlock a fast travel option - don't fret!  But there is a lot of running around at first.  It's nice because you get to learn the basics.  But you can also run into massively overpowered foes so be careful!

The story is just amazing - very interesting, original, unique - the kind of story that leaves you pondering existence.  I guess that's why so many folks call this an existential game!

You can adjust the difficulty, so there is a super easy mode for non-gamers (like my wife) and advanced difficulty for those who enjoy punishment.  Oh and the game has 27 endings.  Folks recommend playing through at least 3.  Keep watching through credits.  No spoilers. ;)

I guess this game sold much better than Squeenix predicted, so we'll be seeing more titles from this franchise soon.  And I recommend downloading the soundtrack from Amazon for $20 - it's gorgeous.",actual bought wife she hook havent much time play combin amaz blend 3rd person action rpg shooter semi open world explor littl game unlock fast travel option dont fret lot run around first nice get learn basic also run massiv overpow foe care stori amaz interest origin uniqu kind stori leav ponder exist guess that mani folk call existenti game adjust difficulti super easi mode nongam like wife advanc difficulti enjoy punish oh game 27 end folk recommend play least 3 keep watch credit spoiler guess game sold much better squeenix predict well see titl franchis soon recommend download soundtrack amazon 20 gorgeou,1506729600,5

Automatically I liked it better than Phantom Hourglass because even though you returned to the same tower repeatedly, it didn't feel like you were backtracking.  Controlling Zelda in the metal suit was cool and added depth to the puzzles.  But everything is fine, like controls, story, graphics, all great.  But it feels like something is missing.  Maybe I just hated the traveling via train and it discouraged me from exploring around.  I didn't find a single heart piece, but I found an endless amount of treasure that I didn't use for anything, apparently it grants you train parts.  When I reached dungeons (which felt like an eternity), I absolutely loved them.  Great puzzles, great bosses, some of the graphics really blew my mind.  But it felt like I didn't care about doing anything else, which is a staple of Zelda games.

48330,720,4076,"The game is fun to play and the character interactions are hilarious and feels mostly natural.  The story itself sat in the planning for way to long.  Even after having consumed the anime (free on YouTube), the movie Kingsglaive, and all other reference and source material out there, the story itself feels like a tale told so often that you skip details you think the audience already knows.  This breaks the flow of the narrative in a jarring way.  Some parts of the story move fast and amp up your drive to eat up every bit there is, but then it skips ahead, or changes the flow in a way that pulls you out of the mood to keep pressing forward.  Other times there are explanations that just lack clarity.
SE is aware of these flaws and have promised to (eventually) add free content that plugs in the holes.  New scenes, more dialogue, etc.

There are also mini-events that you need to DL, most of which are free, that give you mini-games and all to play. Most recently an Assassins Creed tie-in that rewards some neat looking outfits.  Unfortunately i don't think the new mechanics are pulled into the main game so it ends up just feeling like a show-and-tell & ""look what we can do with this engine"" from SE.  Some of these items are just shoehorned into the world without any (in-game) lore that links them and makes them feel like an authentic piece of the world.  What ever explanation is there is back-filled in the event itself.

The mechanics are fun but easily exploitable.  Just running around doing the side-quests you can over level to the point of breaking your character.

There are games that are hard but to the point where they are challenging that want you to keep going and learn from your mistakes. This game does not do that for me. Its just as I said earlier. Its just unfair and relentless in its brutal difficulty. After giving this game and others like it hours upon hours of my time I've come to realize that every time I play this game I am not having fun. Its a grind. Its painful. Yeah I'll admit I have way more fun with games like Madden and Call of Duty. I can relax and enjoy those games. With Dark Souls III I just can't find any enjoyment here. Its pretty to look at. However, I find the controls sluggish, enemies way over powered, and an absolute chore to play.

""Keeps Console Cool
By positioning your PS4 vertically, the stand allows for better air circulation, which helps keep the console cool. A cooler console in turn promotes optimal performance and longer life.""

For one thing, the big fan inside pushes the hot air inside out the BACK of the console, not the left side (which becomes the top when it's vertical). And hot air rises (grade school science), so any air that manages to go up instead of out the back would rise to the hard drive in the left side (now the top) and make the HD hotter while it's running.

The ONLY reason you put a console vertical (which you really don't want to do.... most PS2's that had disc drive problems were cause it was vertical, drives/cd's can wobble when not horizontal and the drives were CONSTANTLY being used for games or movies. It's better these days cause you barely use the actual disc, but still....) is if you barely have space and need the room on your entertainment center...

However, this game is only similar to Diablo in the fact that it's an ARPG, and it's displayed at a 45-degree isometric view. While this game isn't bad by any means, it's still fun to play. Character creation is lackluster, and truth be told it really doesn't need one--but I guess this game sets itself apart from others because of it. This game is more fun played with other people, and while online play is a mixed bag of skilled/non-skilled players... the single player aspect of the title felt really dull to me.

48382,1125,208,"THE LAST OF US is the game that largely destroyed computer gaming for me. Prior to it I was content with the silly little plots that most games tried to use as an excuse for all of the gaming experience. But there is a distinction here: most games have stories but are not really about the story. In DIABLO, you play in order to level up and fight huge gobs of demons and zealots. In most games, you get through the story to get to the game; in THE LAST OF US, you play the game in order to get to the story. But there is more to it than that. The game play helps create the bond that Joel and Ellie feel for one another. The last chapter in Pittsburgh creates in Joel the sense that he can't allow himself to reconnect fully with another human being. There is a very small but telling moment. Joel and Ellie reach his brother Tommy. When they are alone, Tommy tells Joel he had returned to Joel's house in Austen, Texas, where the game begins; there he found a photo of Joel and Sara from 20 years previous, when the fungal outbreak began. Playing Joel you can hold the photo as long as you want, but the only action in the game is to return the photo, saying ""I'm good."" A couple of minutes later, Joel proposes leaving Ellie with Tommy and any other former Fireflies. Joel knows he is on the precipice. If he goes any further with Ellie, she will emotionally function as a replacement for the daughter he had lost. And sure enough, before leaving Jackson Hole, Joel has acknowledged that there was a bond between Ellie and him, one that was impossible to ignore. Joel has essentially become Ellie's father. And the flipside is equally important. In the suburbs of Pittsburgh a boy asks Ellis what she is really afraid of and after a mild attempt to evade his question she answers, ""Ending up alone."" So the old man who never thought he would be a father again is bonded with a girl who above all else wants someone to whom she is bonded.

Most people misread the end of the game, thinking that Joel becomes a monster. But allowing to Ellie was both emotionally and morally intolerable. It was a complete nonoption. And many assume that Ellie knew she was about to die. But her conversation with Joel belies that reading. Immediately after defeating the last group of infected - and I'm surprised so many run around in circles to elude them. You can choke out about six, use the bow on three or four others, then a thrown glass bottle to attract the others to a spot, a couple of Molotov cocktails on the mob and clean up on what is left with the flame thrower. Not even on Grounded mode have I avoided killing all of them. Any way, after dealing with all the infected in the underpass to the hospital, Ellie comments that after they are done with the Fireflies, he can teach her to swim. She was scared of possible medical procedures in Salt Lake City - this is a girl, after all, who has confessed that she was really scared of needles. As tough as she is, her fear of doctors and hospitals is set at a very low level. She was steeled to get through whatever was needed at the hospital, though clearly she did not think it would involve decapitation. She was thinking in terms of giving blood. Once Joel knew what the Fireflies intended to do, just leaving Ellie behind would have meant for him to revert to the monster he had been. It wasn't Joel who was the monster, but Marlene, who was violating her pledge to Ellie's mother to take care of her. Most who condemn Joel neglect to point out that Marlene wasn't giving Ellie any say in the matter. And one of the questions raised by the encounters Ellie and Joel have with the remnants of humanity is whether they deserve to be saved. The tragedy of the story is the lie that Joel tells to keep Ellie from learning that the woman she had thought her mother's closest friend was trying to murder her on the off chance that decapitating her would save the rest of humanity. Of course, Ellie knows at the end of the game that Joel has lied to her. She is uncertain about what the lie is and why he is telling it, but she knows that he hasn't been truthful. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, in the essay on lying - written while being interrogated in prison by the Nazis and included in the volume known by the title ETHICS - argued that being honest sometimes involved avoided stating what was factually correct, something especially true when one is trying to avoid revealing to interrogators that one is part of a conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler. One could - and I in fact do - argue that being honest to Ellie meant lying to her about Marlene's intention to cut her head off so that she could remove her brain. I have been amazed that so many people have been outraged at Joel's lie to Ellie, when to me it seems clear that Joel preferred Ellie being angry at him rather than knowing that the woman who had been most concerned with her upbringing (even though she maintained some distance, putting Ellie in military school rather than raising her directly) had intended to murder her.

There are too few games like this one, games with dense content and ""round"" characters (in the sense described by E. M. Forster, in contrast to ""flat"" characters. I love games. I very much disagree with those who feel that the key to great storytelling is open ended games. Without a degree of structure, you don't really have much of a narrative. A game like Fallout 4 may force you to make some tough decisions, making you take some hard stances in the course of things, but there is no significant narrative. The Uncharted games have been reasonably interesting, though I didn't think that the characters were anywhere nearly as interesting until Uncharted 4. I have not been that impressed by the Mass Effect games as narrative, though I did enjoy them (though like a lot of others I had problems with the ending of ME3). What sets this one apart from other games is how it excels at not just at plot, but character development. Even Naughty Dog's other ongoing title, UNCHARTED, cannot even remotely compare with the kind of change we see in Joel and Ellie. At its core, TLOU is not a game about fighting zombies and humans in a post-apocalyptic America. it is about whether a 50 year old man who has been emotionally shut down for 20 can learn to love someone who is essentially his foster daughter like the daughter he lost earlier, and if a 14 year old girl will find a surrogate parent that she has always yearned for. And as I said, with all of that great character development - actually, because of that great character development - the ending possesses a degree of emotional complexity unheard of in video games.

I'll stop there, though I could go on to talk about the splendid game play and game design. A lot of people don't grasp the point of some of the game's simpler moments. A simplistic puzzle that involves carrying a ladder around some obstacles is lambasted by some as a subpar puzzle. But the point of the puzzle is to slow down the pace of the game without stopping it. In fact, the game design, just like the character development, is smart an sophisticated, even five years after its release. It may not look a cutting edge visually as it did in 2013, but lit represented a massive leap forward in showing how a game could tell a story. And now TLOU Pt. 2 is under development. Few details are available, but we know that Ellie and Joel are back, though Ellie will be more front and center. Some are speculating that Joel dies early in the game, but that seems unlikely to me. they would be anxious to give away a plot point that gargantuan in a teaser. Huge plot twists will be saved for the game itself. When will it appear? Anyone's guess. I personally thought when the announcement video appeared that it was so heavily stylized that it was impossible to tell anything about the contents of the actual game, though that didn't keep a host of people from dissecting every little detail of the teaser as if it were Holy Scripture. To me we know for certainly only a few things for certain about the game, many of them confirmed by writer, director, and producer Neil Druckman: Joel and Ellie are back; the first game was about love, but the second game is about hate; Ellie is 19 years old in the second game; a major character in the second game is played by and mocapped by Shannon Woodward of the TV comedy RAISING HOPE and robot TV SF drama WESTWORLD; Druckman's long time partner Bruce Staley is taking an extended vacation after having spent over a decade killing himself making some of the greatest games in the history of video gaming; and superstar composer Gustavo Santaolalla is returning to do what will surely be another amazing score. There may be a few more details from interviewed here and there, but the truth is that we don't know a heck of a whole lot. My personal theory is that the game will be released late next year or early in 2019. Many regard Naughty Dog to be the world's finest making of videogames and I agree. Here is hoping that they keep the major touch alive for at least one more stellar game.",last u game larg destroy comput game prior content silli littl plot game tri use excus game experi distinct game stori realli stori diablo play order level fight huge gob demon zealot game get stori get game last u play game order get stori game play help creat bond joel elli feel one anoth last chapter pittsburgh creat joel sen cant allow reconnect fulli anoth human small tell moment joel elli reach brother tommi alon tommi tell joel return joel hous austen texa game begin found photo joel sara 20 year previou fungal outbreak began play joel hold photo long want action game return photo say im good coupl minut later joel propos leav elli tommi former firefli joel know precipic goe elli emot function replac daughter lost sure enough leav jackson hole joel acknowledg bond elli one imposs ignor joel essenti becom,1507075200,5

When a big bad Publisher does them wrong
But, small shady developers get a pass at screwing them

I've been playing video games very long (My first home console wasn't the PS2 and I actually went to arcades and put quarters in Arcade cabinets to play games
Mafia III is simply phenomenal in every sense of the word
Is it perfect? no but, it's minor short comings can be over looked
When i first learned of the setting I didn't think I'd like it But, then when more info came out
I was all in
One thing I'm calling out 2K Games on is the stupid apology the game has before you can even sign in
I understand we live in a phony outrage society
But, you want to show a portrait of a real time you can't apology for language and images
Them doing this just bothers me
You never see any type of warning or apology on the nighty news!

One other negative towards Mafia III would be the interface it's so confusing
going into settings is a massive pain everything is split up into 4 different section
you can either chose lethal take down, or a non kill take downs (You can only switch that in the settings which will drive anyone mad
It interrupts the flow! I could be wrong on this
The interface is so blah and outdated.... If you play it you'll know what I'm talking about its very hard to try and explain
(I would've gave the game a solid 10/10 if the interface wasn't so confusing it takes a chunk out of the enjoyment level

Story: Is the major selling point
It does was Call of Duty: Black Ops should have done
It tells a smart story during one of the modern eras most darkest times
Between the racial tension, and anti-war
It's 1968 and you are in the south and you are a man of color
I don't want to ruin the story for anyone it's really smart and enjoyable with slick twist and turns
The prologue settings up ""how"" to play is long and super enjoyable
Maybe one of the best prologues I've ever played to a game

Graphics: Are a mixed bag (All the cut scenes look fantastic the facial animation/capture is on par with L.A. Noire
the game itself runs very smooth I've put a good 40+ hrs into it the game itself crashed on me one time
There's a lot of saves spots that will help trust me
For a open world game it's solid (No open world game to date has been flawless don't be fooled Even if you have a $15,000 high end gaming PC it's not going to be flawless so much going on screen there are minor bugs, in all these games even the Golden child GTA5
Could this game run on the previous generation hardware????
I doubt it.... it would've crashed or flat out killed any XBox 360 or PS3

Controls: after maybe 20minutes tops you'll be good to go everything becomes second nature
The driving at first is a bit hinky (It's not Sim style driving it reminds me of Sega's Crazy Taxi)
Different vehicles handle differently.... But, you can chose Sim style driving if that's your thing
If you drive a 18 Wheeler you have to use some logic unless you drop the back end, the sea crafts handle ok (more or less mimicking Sleeping Dogs) Breaking into building is balanced and easy
using weapons is easy, the hand to hand combat is ""there"" it's not terrible but, it's not perfect it's above average

Audio/Licensed music: The audio is really good DTS 5.1
the games score fits, every voice over cast members fits in this world
(There's all types of smart written dialogue even by the back ground characters
the radio stations are awesome with great 1960's music from R&B, Country, and Rock & Roll
almost all the licensed music is gold

Game play: It's a open world set in 1968 Louisiana
The world itself is crazy huge (made up of a factory district, middle class, down town, slums, swamps, then more of a higher society
Depending on where you are you'll be talked to differently depending on where you are
In the High Class area of the city the people talk down to you, cops watch you more and will also say crazy racist remarks to you
some buildings/stores have signs that say whites only (If you walk in there the owner will walk at you very fast and try and kick you out and threaten to call the police!
The AI of the Police is a mixed bag sometimes they are a bit thick and easy to outsmart
But, if you get to many of them on you they will shoot you up like Bonnie and Clyde
The AI of the enemy gangs on the other hand are very relentless and smart if you encounter them the wrong way
You can play the game two ways run and gun
or be smart and go in stealth
Stealth is the smart way until you get a idea of patterns and how different AI think
The Stealth is streamlined and easy to pick up it's like Manhunt or the first couple of Assassin's Creed games
I'm not a fan of pure stealth games this isn't one of those
The gun play is balanced not arcade but, it's not completely stiff
The open world itself is very much a live with a day/night cycle and a weather cycle
Plenty of items to Collected for all those people out there with OCD
You collect Playboy Magazines, Auto Magazines, Pin-up Art, Propaganda Posters, Classic vinyl records, and religious paintings
you can also come across these green cylinders
Once you have enough and you get to a point in the main story campaign you can plant wire taps (A Easter egg aiming at Watergate)
Which gives you icons where the collectables are

I've put at least 35hrs into the game I've barely scratched the surface
Check out all the images I've posted

If you love American History/the underdog open world games like Just Cause, Mafia II, Mad Max, Saints Row, Sunset Overdrive you'll love this game
It's one of the best games of the Year I've played 9.5/10

48474,256,1712,"First i would like to say, if you're an audiophile and want high quality sound when listing to entertainment outside of gaming (movies, music, etc) then i recommend getting a separate headset for that. Not to say that the Astro A40TR is bad, it is above average (way better than stock headphones/ear buds you get with your smart phone for example), but it's not necessarily the best all around headset for entertainment even if you adjust the presets. But for gaming it's one of the best out there.

Mic Quality. Very clear sound. Communication is very good, you're able to hear individual words well. It's not going to make a natural sound like when you're talking face-to-face with someone. It's more like a crystal clear radio voice with no raspy interference or static, which you need if you're in a competitive team setting

Picking up footsteps (Mainly for first person shooter games). Works very well, the drivers in the headset is dedicated to it, seeing use in other forms of entertainment is okay. This is basically what you're getting the headset for in my opinion as it's the main focus as being a tournament ready device. In general, the headset picks exaggerated footsteps sounds very well, which is perfect for gameplay (which is more enhanced if you hook up an Amp)

For dynamic range of sound, from my experience it depends on the game, and sound team of devs that built the game. If you want to be competitive for any game while using any headset, i recommend going to the sound options of the game and turn off music volume completely and max out sound effects/in-game sound. This will improve your game sense and may rank you up in the game because of it.

Comfort. One of the best headsets for long term use. Best I've tried is the Honstek G6 Wired PC Gaming Headset; fit your head very well and super soft even after extended use, but the sound quality is not good on it. Back on topic, ear bud padding is excellent, does not clamp your head with excessive pressure. You are able to adjust the vertical length of both sides for a custom fit. Love how the cups rotate, and able to hang below your neck and lay on your chest. Most headphones I've tried have a tight clasp squeezing, if not trying to choke you making you take the headset off completely and put it off to the side when taking breaks. With these they can just hang on you without any discomfort.

Visual design. It's all black with hint of gold. Would love if the spiral wire on the sides were of different color to make the headset pop-out more like the Astro A50 I own. Looks very good for home/office use. For displaying in public, you may get some odd looks, especially with the mic attachment. With the A40TR you are able to switch face-plates if you want a more custom look

In-line controls. Very ergonomic, you are able to distinguish every button/slider without looking at it. Very natural, don't even have to build up a habit. You can also lift up the mic on the headset to mute yourself, which I tend to gravitate towards since I built a habit with the A50s.

Overall, very solid gaming headset. If you can afford it, I'd get another headset for other forms of entertainment as this headset does a decent job, but not the best out there. Having a variety of headsets also helps you get more focused in a competitive setting when your head feels the difference in pressure making you more in-tune with the game (maybe that's just me). If you have any questions, put in the the comments and i'll try my best to answer to best of my ability.

When putting it back together don't screw it in too tightly. Explains why some users are having no issues too. Deducted one star as the battery compartment does affect the comfort of your grip.

48589,648,4332,"Prior to Nier: Automata, I wasn't too familiar with the Nier franchise. I think I read about Nier: Automata somewhere, and it piqued my interest, so I decided to give it a go. Its only fair for me to admit I only finished the first playthrough (Route A, I believe its called). However, I spent 30 hours on the game, and Im thinking Ive gathered enough intel to give it a fair shake. Ok, here are eight things that jumped out at me during my 30 hours.

[1] Its a Platinum game; so of course the combat was top notch. Part of the reason why it took me 30 hours to complete a short campaign is because I often ran around looking for random enemies to fight! Now, THATs the mark of a game that has great combat! Each swing of my chosen weapon (a spear) felt smooth and realistic. Top that off with the ability to shoot lasers (A companion called a Pod), and I was a happy customer. I feel the need to point out that if you play the 2nd campaign (9S's campaign) he's not great at melee combat (from what I hear), so you'll need to rely on his hacking ability to take down enemies. I had very little experience with the hacking feature because it was only needed once, during 2B's playhthrough (I didn't care for it too much).

[2] I just mentioned the Pod was a companion in battle, but thats not your only teammate. Ive always enjoyed games that give you an A.I. partner, so I was thrilled that 9S joined 2B for most of the first playthrough. In my opinion, he was more than just a tag-along partner because he often killed enemies by himself. I liked that I could customize his tendencies; meaning I could decide how aggressive I wanted him to be in combat.

[3] I wasn't too fond of the game save system. Maybe its just me, but Ive grown accustomed to games autosaving, which usually means I had one less thing to worry about, while playing. Granted, Nier autosaved after certain events, but outside of that, the onus is on YOU to make sure to save your progress; or you may not like your respawn point, if you happen to die.

[4] Starting off, I wasn't too impressed by the enemies because they all felt similar (all robots, for what its worth). As I progressed, I felt there was a bit more variety, but still not great. The boss battles were  weird Im not saying thats a bad thing, by the way. For example; I was only able to inflict damage on one of the bosses by using counter attacks. The bastard blocked everything else

[5] Im going to touch on the most interesting aspect of the game. Going in, I was a little afraid of the various 2D and overhead shooter sequences of the game because I wasn't sure how that would all work. Believe it or not, it worked pretty darn well and it kept things interesting. Heres an example of how it played out. You might start off a boss battle in 3D, and before you know it, the screen flips to an overhead view, where youll need to start shooting in order to survive.

[6] I don't normally talk about video game music (because I don't care), but Nier: Automatas soundtrack was phenomenal! This is probably the best soundtrack since Rayman Legends (for me, at least). They did a great job of setting the stage with some of the musical choices. If it was an intense battle, the music reflected that. If it was a softer moment, the music did a great job of reflecting that as well. I often found myself humming along.

[7] The sidemissions are one of the main reasons why I couldn't give the game 5 stars. I love sidemissions, and they play an important role, with any game. Too many of the sidemissions in Nier were Go and find this type of missions, and those are annoying. Also, there were a couple of sidemissions that I just could not find (a terrible map didn't help). After visiting YouTube, I discovered that I had to progress further in the story, in order to unlock some of the sidequests. Heres my question: Why in the hell was I allowed to accept a sidequest that technically was not available? How does that make sense?? I left quite a few sidemissions unfinished, and thats something I rarely do.

[8] This last point is pretty important. If you're the type of gamer who cares about the story (I do not); youll need to know this game requires multiple playthroughs in order to get the full story. The 1st playthrough is from 2Bs perspective, while the 2nd playthrough is from 9Ss. As for the 3rd playthrough, I don't want to spoil anything, but if you MUST know who the character is, just look on the front of the box, lol. Again, I only played through the 1st campaign, so I cant speak to any of the details of the other playthroughs.

Sidemissions not withstanding; I enjoyed my Nier: Automata experience. I sincerely believe its the type of game that can be as long (or as short) as you want it to be. If you're like me and couldn't care less about the story, I think the first playthrough will satisfy you enough. Kudos to the developers for successfully mixing and matching different genres within the same game. If you're looking for something different, with excellent combat, then I highly recommend this game.

The story was good and kept me hooked. I was skeptical about the controls being difficult because of trying to hack everything, but it was just the opposite - pretty simple. It took me about 22-23 hours to complete with some side quests here and there. I thought the cars and driving was good. Nice assortment of weapons and explosives to use. Some missions I found my self playing very stealthy, and others I went guns blazing, so good game for any play style. The only negative I can say is that I found it very easy to make money.

48665,8850,4320,"This game was definitely hyped up and these reviews of perfect 10's are completely incorrect. The game itself, like most people have mentioned, plays out like far cry/tomb raider/ whatever else open world game. HZD does not really differentiate itself from others, instead using recycled open world gameplay formula.
  I honestly believe people are just saying it's perfect cause the graphics and the fact it looks like a how a game made in 2017 should be. The graphics are really great with HDR and 4k, assuming you have the ps4 pro and hdr tv. The lighting looks fantastic and the detail is quit amazing. I really don't see any flaws with the graphics at all to be honest.
  Just because the graphics are great doesn't make it the best however. The open world itself is big enough, however, it's just so empty. Besides the map pointing out where any ""hidden"" collectable may be, there is absolutely no reason to explore. It's too bad considering how good the environment looks. Many times you will want to wonder off thinking theres something there only to find nothing at all, maybe just some dino robots. There is no sense of reward for exploration, just nice looking scenery.
  The combat was decent; not terrible and not thrilling. You're given many options of combat, however, arrows are really the only thing you may need. Theres traps, tripwires, ropecaster (good for flying things) but arrows were the only thing i really even needed. Theres many differnt types of those too but I only needed the ""damage"" arrows"". Once i discovered that you can freeze them with ice arrows, the damage arrows make it much pretty easy to take down the most intimidating robots. So ice/damage was all i needed. Even the armor had 3 classes: common, rare, very rare. I only needed one type of armor to survive, that being the last of each tier. Stealth wasn't needed very often, maybe for sneak attack, but you could easily go up to humans or some robots and start slashing away with your spear.
  The story was also just decent i found. You really are left wondering until kind of towards the end. Until then, you're just assuming it's an apolyctic world in which it's back to the ""Stone Age/ Tribe"" setting but with robotic dinosaurs? theres a war going on the first half so i find it didn't catch my attention at all until you explore the ""metal world"" or the old labs of humanity. There you find out what really happens and the story begins to pull you in. However, at the end (no spoilers), it gets pretty confusing and unbelievable. There are some nice twists though (especially the ending) and it does pull you in for a little while.
  The missions are not very fun though. The main missions are typical go here, kill that, learn piece of story. Nothing great. The side missions are just plain terrible. There's no reason to even follow the story of them as it's not exciting. You usually use your sense thing to follow a trial and look for someone or kill something. That is it. No reason to care just go here and come back. I really can't think of a single mission that was cool or rememberable. That's about it for missions.
  Lastly are the characters. Aloy is a decent character and nicely voiced by whomever. The other tribes can have nice voice acting but you really have little to care for these characters. The main characters in the story itself are pretty bland and really have no reason to care for most of them. You will meet a few who tie in the story altogether but serve little purpose to really care for them. You see them for a little while on screen and get introduced to another and tie in at the end. Not too much back story to really care and could care who lives or die in these tribes. The side missions, again, are even worse. There is no reason to give a shit about them or whatever they want. Looking for someone, piece of equipment, no reason at all to care. In fact, the real shame is the lifeless towns and the people who inhabit it. Theres a merchant, maybe a boring side quest or two, and that's it. Nothing else. People walk around and there's no interaction so may as well all be ghost towns. That really pulls away from the immersion. The holograms you see of the human world in the past, however, is pretty interesting towards the ends.
  All in all, i would give the game a 7/10. It was entertaining, but once you're done, you're done. You are left with a feeling of ""OK, that was entertaining on to the next thing."" maybe 60 hours to get the platinum trophy, which would be 100% completion. It was mostly enjoyable while it lasted but was ready for it to end towards the end. In time, people will look back and not care too much i think. It will be remembered for a great looking PS exclusive title one day and that's about it. HZD is basically a knock off of Far Cry with robot dinosaurs so if you're looking for something different, this is not it.

It is very important to know the difficult has been decreased. It's not easy, except maybe in the very beginning to get a feel for it, but it will challenge it. In fact, it has additional bonus rounds and bosses that you can face after you beat the primary campaign. Many of the bosses are from other Final Fantasy games as a way to give respect and homage. I really love this game, but there is a simple story and the 4 characters you choose of 6 different classes have no names and referred only as the Heroes of Light. The music has also been updated and is amazing, adventurous, and beautiful! (as are most FF games). It's important to know this was the first game in the series, but also what the company Square Enix thought would be their last! They did put a lot of heart and soul in this game, but also were cautious to not got overboard in case it didn't get well received! If you've never played Final Fantasy, try some of the later games, but this isn't for some gamer interested in stunning visuals and blast your ass action. This is a JRPG adventure game.

The graphics have improved like the versions for FF1 and FF2, the music has been updated and sounds so amazing and beautiful! It really fits well where each track is placed and helps tell the story and bring out the characters and themes. The characters are far more fleshed out and interesting and have great and unique personalities. There are traditional arcs as well as new ones thought up by Square Enix. The gameplay is different than it's earlier games as it has an ATB gauge, which once filled gives each of the characters a turn. There isn't a pause or delay like in FF1-3, so it's important to know what you are doing or you can die or get badly damaged. It is also the first and only FF game to have as many as 5 characters at a time, but it isn't all throughout the game. At first it is 2, but the average is 3 as characters come in and out of your control due to the events of the story, which enriches and brings a challenge to the game. This is not an easy game, especially if you don't know what you are doing, but once you get the hang of it it's great fun as well as challenging.

3.  I encountered a incredibly frustrating glitch during a mission that I spent a lot of time on only to have to start over from the beginning due to not being able to hear the instructions over the noise of a sandstorm.  Which brings me to my next point.
4.  Instructions and tutorials are VERY lacking.  I can't tell you how many times I've had to Google how to do something properly or what something in the mother base menu meant.  The game is terrible at explaining some things.

I've been playing FPSs since Wolfenstein 3D back in 1992. I'm kind of jaded when it comes to FPSs because very rarely does a company add anything to them that catches my attention.

Somehow Blizzard did it. They made a FPS that I think is an absolute blast to play!

The game is extremely polished. The art and graphics are top notch. But that's not what keeps me coming back. What keeps me coming back are the diversity in the characters (their abilities) and how simple the controls are.

I really like how the flow of a game will change based on what characters are used (you can choose a new character each time you die). The game always feels fresh and fun. Blizzard is also constantly updating it and adding new content. Right now (October) there is special Halloween content (game modes and skins).

I actually bought a second Xbox so I could play this game with my son--that's how good it is.

48775,256,735,"Best built in mic on any gaming headset I've tried. Mic sound coming from it sounds very natural like studio mics when testing it out with friends, and listening to it post recording. Sounds more like you're talking to someone in person rather than with someone off a radio for instance, which is good for run on sentences and lengthy commands/commentary compared to few word notification to your teammates to tell them where the enemies/objectives are

Sound coming from the headset itself are great in terms of multimedia (movies, music, TV,shows, etc), but for picking up in-game sound like footsteps and trying to deciphering distance of objects and in-game enemies are not that good.

With that said, this headset is excellent if you're a streamer (playing games on easy/normal mode) as you do not need an additional external mic setup as the one built into the headset is quite sufficient especially if you're going to talk for extended amounts of time. For in-game use, it's good for casual play or if you have poor sound depth perception to begin with and/or like to issue out commands/provide support on your team rather than being on top of the leaderboard in a match.

Tips for improving your game in terms of sound for ANY headset:
I recommend going to the sound options of the game and turn off music volume completely and max out sound effects/in-game sound.
Then go to training mode with a friend, have him/her walk around your character to judge step distance (some games varies, also may be character/hero/object dependent). Then blind fold yourself, and do a test to judge direction it's coming from.
This will improve your game sense and may rank you up in the game because of it.

Headset is very comfortable and able to wear for long hours without any discomfort. This generally depends on your head size/shape, but from myself and two friends who tried it, this is definitely the case

Controls on this headset is very minimal. There's a scroll wheel volume dial on the side which gets a bit of getting used to. Not as practical as a scroll wheel that you slide/flick with your finger for instance. I'd say best to have it on default volume all the time or if you have an amp attachment to your headset use the volume control on that instead. There's no software customization, so you have to rely on the hardware itself

Overall I'd say this headset is good for entertainment purposes i.e. streaming online or like to talk a lot in-game due to the excellent micophone. The headset sound itself is not exactly built for gaming in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, it sound excellent as a stand alone headphone across all media, but it doesn't pick up exaggerated footsteps and sound depth perception like other gaming headsets do. It seems like Sennheiser initially made a high quality sounding headset and said, 'hey let's make a gaming headset without sacrificing overall quality sound across all other media'  best way they did this (or at least my theory) is to make a excellent mic that stands out for communication purposes",best built mic game headset ive tri mic sound come sound natur like studio mic test friend listen post record sound like your talk someon person rather someon radio instanc good run sentenc lengthi commandscommentari compar word notif teammat tell enemiesobject sound come headset great term multimedia movi music tvshow etc pick ingam sound like footstep tri deciph distanc object ingam enemi good said headset excel your streamer play game easynorm mode need addit extern mic setup one built headset quit suffici especi your go talk extend amount time ingam use good casual play poor sound depth percept begin andor like issu commandsprovid support team rather top leaderboard match tip improv game term sound headset recommend go sound option game turn music volum complet max sound effectsingam sound go train mode friend himher walk around charact judg step distanc game vari also may characterheroobject depend blind fold test judg direct come improv game sen may rank game headset comfort abl wear,1507852800,4

48796,1265,3912,"Ok here is my review for this headset. I haven't actually used it much yet but I'm writing this review before I forget. I may add to this one after I used it for a while. Ok 2 stars because when I installed the software for the headset it pretty much crashed my system. For some reason I could not connect to the internet. Then the laptop froze and I ended up performing a System Restore. I wasn't sure if that was it because I was installing a few other programs and drivers. So the second time I installed the headset driver last and every time I installed something I restarted and checked to see if I could still get on the internet sure enough as soon as I did the headset driver no internet. long story short I ended up installing the drivers from MSI website even then it still doesn't work that well, system crashes sometimes at startup but I just restart and its fine, just annoying. I have a MSI laptop and expect things that are the same brand to work together seamlessly so 2 stars for that. we will see in a few weeks if I get tired of rebooting I'll send it back. The MSI mouse and software works just fine.
Review part 2: I've had the headset for a while now and I'm not going to say it's garbage, but the software is. there is hardly no adjustments to the volume just mic volume and speaker volume. So no problem I have Nahimic right (that's the awesome hardware that comes with the MSI Titan Laptop). But guess what... The headphone software disables it WOW... so the only adjustment to sound is a Bass button on the cord. My Sony headphones that are for music and not gaming but has a mic so I can talk works with Nahimic and they cost $18. So they sound ok I'm going to keep them only because the dragon on the sides light up and looks real cool. but I feel kind of stupid spending this much money on gaming headphones that don't do anything extra and are actually worst that what I had before but that's why we right reviews right, so the next person knows that he/she is getting. So in conclusion defiantly buy this if you like the dragon to light up to match your rig and do nothing special. Otherwise save your money and get ""anything"" else.",ok review headset havent actual use much yet im write review forget may add one use ok 2 star instal softwar headset pretti much crash system reason could connect internet laptop froze end perform system restor wasnt sure instal program driver second time instal headset driver last everi time instal someth restart check see could still get internet sure enough soon headset driver internet long stori short end instal driver msi websit even still doesnt work well system crash sometim startup restart fine annoy msi laptop expect thing brand work togeth seamlessli 2 star see week get tire reboot ill send back msi mous softwar work fine review part 2 ive headset im go say garbag softwar hardli adjust volum mic volum speaker volum problem nahim right that awesom hardwar come msi titan laptop guess headphon softwar disabl wow adjust sound bass button cord soni headphon music,1507939200,2

48800,2280,351,"This review is for the PS4 version.

I am pretty late to the game with AC games.  Recently, I played for the first time and completed the Ezio Collection and although there were some things I found that I didn't like about the games, I was hooked.  So, when some of the other AC games went on sale, I grabbed them, including Syndicate.

As with the other AC games, there is lots to do with the main missions, side missions and collecting stuff.  As it is with the collecting things, it does get a bit repetitive and probably the least favorite part of the game.  My least favorite of these are collecting the helix glitches which are hard to see, hard to find and a pain to collect at times with the requirement to exactly put the grapple hook in a certain area to be able to grab the glitch, in addition to looking like the fast travel icons on the map.  The find the killer side missions are fun though and something different to do in the game.  The boxing matches are fun although I found a bit glitchy as at times, the fighters get stuck on the outside of the ring.  There are the horse races which are ok but nothing particularly special.

The London landscape is detailed and well done with really good graphics.  The basic gameplay is pretty much the same as the previous games as I have played which makes it feel familiar and easy to start playing but at the same time, it feels the same as the other games with only a few new additions.

I am not big fan of multiplayer so the lack of a MP option is not a big deal for me.

With the Ezio collection, I felt that the gameplay controls were a bit awkward especially for jumping and climbing.  Syndicate seems to be much smoother in that respect, especially with the climbing that feels smooth and easy to do, although there are times that the character does something different than I expected or wanted it to do.  The one awkward thing to me is how they do the leap of faith jumps that take 3 buttons.  I really would have preferred this to be a bit more simplified.

There are lots of places to see and things to do and I really like exploring the varies areas around the city.  There are more places that you can go inside, such as the pubs and such although outside of mission specific things to do or collecting, there isn't much to do.  It would have been nice is there is more opportunity to interact with the environment and various citizens of the city.  It is cool to be able to play as either the brother or sister characters, although the abilities page is pretty much the same and there doesnt seem to be a lot of diversity in what they can do.

Although I have enjoyed playing the game, I do have a few grips though.  There are times when there are glitchy camera views that make it hard to see and do things, such as a massive tree blocking your view in the middle of a fight.  There are long loading times in various parts of the game, especially when you have to restart a mission.  Sometimes, when you need to push a button to do certain things, the game gets a bit finicky as to the specific area you need to stand to do so.  Normally that isn't a problem but when you are on a timed mission, such as the stop the train mission, this can be a bit of a pain.  The grapple gun is a cool addition to gameplay but sometimes is a pain to use as it only allows certain areas of a roof to grapple to.  I am also not a fan of the trend to pay with microtransactions to get extra stuff concept but luckily you can avoid that and still build your character without paying extra to do so.

I can see where people can be frustrated with the sameness of the series but for me, since I have only played the Ezio Collection, I am enjoying the game even with some of its flaws.

Of course, when this game first came out, I was extremely excited. The ads were very interesting, and the idea of the open-world was cool. Unfortunately, when I played this game for a few days worth of time, I felt disappointed and there were a few glaring problems for me: Awful dialogue, the cars sometimes feel as if you're driving on ice, the god-awful comic book-esque cutscenes, and a (mostly) bland soundtrack. However, I liked the (albeit very few) new cars, the drift mode in this game with the opponent cars drifting with you, the beautiful visuals, and the short load times.

also the debut to a new character name kurtis is bad only bcuz the new weapon that u see only in cutscenes he cant use during gameplay and  there's certain levels where enemies was supposed to attack but never does ,sprint button is pretty much useless, limited inventory, way too many variety of health items but not enough of everything else

warning #Spoiler: Angel of Darkness follows on from events in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider Chronicles, where Lara Croft was presumed dead. An unspecified time later, Lara arrives in Paris at the request of her former mentor, Werner Von Croy, who mentions that he has been tasked by a man named Eckardt to track medieval icons known as the Obscura Paintings. The city, and Von Croy, are gripped with fear over a serial killer the press have dubbed the ""Monstrum"". The Monstrum steals body parts and leaves distinctive signs made with the victims blood in its wake. During a confrontation with Von Croy at his apartment, a flurry of activity occurs and Lara is knocked unconscious. When she wakes, she discovers Von Croy dead, apparently having been murdered by the Monstrum, and Lara becomes the prime suspect. Fleeing his demise & running away from the cops, Lara tracks down Von Croy's friend Margot Carvier in her apartment building who agrees to give Lara Von Croy's old notebook, which he had left with her for safekeeping. Carvier reveals to Lara how Von Croy had been contracted by Eckhardt to track the Obscura Paintings while adding details on how he had been fearful doing the job. The next day, a local Parisian prostitute reveals to Lara that Carvier has also been murdered by the Monstrum. Shortly before his death, Von Croy had been in contact with a well-known French businessman and secret underworld figure Louis Bouchard. Lara must track down Bouchard through the almost-deserted backstreets of Paris, discovering from locals that Bouchard went into hiding after the death of several of his associates by the Monstrum. When she does locate him, Bouchard reveals Von Croy had contacted him for assistance in breaking into an archaeological dig beneath the Muse du Louvre. Lara gains access to the Louvre through its storm drains, and is able to uncover more information connecting the archaeological dig to the Obscura Paintings. The paintings, which originally depicted demonic imagery, concern the Nephilim, a hybrid creature descended from angels and humans, which once lived in Anatolia. A single dormant Nephilim now remains, the Cubiculum Nephili or ""Sleeper"". The five Obscura Paintings, when connected, form a talisman called the Sanglyph that can be used to revive the Sleeper. To prevent this, an ancient society of warrior Christian monks called the Lux Veritatis was formed and they successfully stopped Eckhardt and his order known as the Cabal by trapping him using three daggers known as Periapt Shards, which can destroy any immortal being. The Lux Veritatis leader known as Brother Obscura seized the paintings, and painted religious imagery over the evil ones and hid them, one of which is in a guarded vault beneath the Louvre. The society also created copies of the paintings known as Obscura Engravings, all of which has an encoded map that leads to the locations of the original paintings.
Lara must descend into the Lux Veritatis stronghold beneath the Louvre to retrieve it. While attempting to escape from the Louvre with the painting, Lara is disarmed by Kurtis Trent, the last living member of the Lux Veritatis, who wields a magical Chirugai blade. Kurtis steals the painting, but both he and Lara are knocked unconscious before they can flee. Upon regaining consciousness, Lara is met by Bouchard, who informs her of a Monstrum killing in Prague, the victim being Mathias Vasiley, an art dealer and historian whom Von Croy exchanged information of the Obscura Engravings. Bouchard then betrays Lara, attempting to have her killed, but Lara survives and makes her way to the Czech Republic. In an upper-class town square in Prague, Lara meets a Czech journalist named Thomas Luddick, who fills her in on Eckhardt, revealed to be an immortal black alchemist who leads a mysterious local organization called the Cabal, and whom Luddick believes is the Monstrum. Lara also encounters a captive Bouchard near the crime scene, who reveals Eckhardt's full plan for reviving the Nephilim. Soon after, Lara rediscovers Bouchard dead. With Luddick's assistance, Lara infiltrates the Cabal's headquarters, the Strahov, and in the process accidentally frees the Proto-Nephilim, the Cabal's unsuccessful attempt to breed a new Nephilim species. Meanwhile, Lara witnesses Eckhardt murder Luddick. She again encounters Kurtis, who locks her in a compartment while he kills the Proto-Nephilim using two Periapt Shards. After an exchange of information, Lara and Kurtis team up to stop Eckhardt assembling the Sanglyph, with Lara retrieving the final Obscura Painting buried deep beneath the Strahov. However, Lara must surrender this painting to save Kurtis, after he is captured by Eckhardt. Kurtis gives Lara his Periapt shards, but she will need a third lost shard to defeat Eckhardt, which Eckhardt has hidden in his laboratory. While Lara flees to track this shard down, Kurtis attempts to hold off an attack from Boaz, the horribly mutated remains of a fallen Cabal member. Kurtis succeeds in killing her, but is severely wounded in the process. After retrieving the final Periapt shard, Lara discovers Eckardt in the midst of attempting to revive the Sleeper, using the Sanglyph and body parts stolen from the Monstrum's victims. She is able to stab him with two shards, but before she can deliver the final blow, she is interrupted by Eckhardt's right-hand man, Karel. Karel kills Eckhardt with the final shard, revealing that he is a Nephilim himself, and had used Eckhardt to ensure the survival of his species. He had also manipulated Lara, in the guise of Bouchard, Luddick and Kurtis, to retrieve the Obscura Paintings. He offers Lara immortality if she will help him complete the task, but Lara experiences a flashback to Von Croys murder, and sees that Karel, in Eckhardt's form, was the Monstrum. She refuses, retrieves the Sanglyph from Eckhardt's body, and plants it on the Sleeper, overloading it with energy and causing it to explode

48901,8874,63,"My frist impression with the PS4 as when this bundle came out was outstanding. I'm sure most games weren't using the console's specs to its max when it first came out so, early games were not so bad at all. I know some games felt like they were upscaled to run well but, Sony has brought their exclusive games to a hard role for the studios to keep up. Overall great console but, my only gripe is that it doesn't play Blurays like the XBOX One can. Sometimes the controller has issues connecting if you have multiple PS4's in your home or if you bring your controller to friends homes to play with and it is an issue majority of the times.

Highlights:

- Great New generation
- Quality of game graphics is amazing
- Sony Services are good as usual
- Can swap hard drives
- White colored console

48903,6786,4479,"After multiple delays, South Park is back and it continues the same shenanigans where it left off. Now right off the bat, the reason I gave this game five stars is because it handles being a sequel even better than it did when it was the first of the franchise. What I mean is that the first game had to prove to you that the game was as good as the show, had a unique combat system and worked over a 10-20 hour story. This game takes everything that's been established and takes it up a notch. The story is full of parodies but does a hilarious job of making fun of the Captain America: Civil War superhero divide and weaves a pretty fun story. I'm close to 8 hours in and I just feel like there is more of everything. Looting different parts of the home just makes you want to look at everything that comes up, pooping mini games are always strangely entertaining and lets be honest, we are here for the writing. Matt and Trey never let something hit the shelves or screens unless it's exactly what they wanted and I feel that polish here. Plus getting a copy of the original game is never bad if you know someone that never played the first or if you want to go back and get some achievements. I feel like they are tipping their hat to us when they give us the original for free. Now a heads up for those that don't watch much South Park but want to get in on all the fun (that was me years ago), there are a lot of poop and fart jokes. They are going to take it way too far but just keep laughing. Turn the analytical part of your mind down while you're playing and it's even better.

+The story is set up great and uses the original as a great stepping stone
+The writing is awesome and I expected nothing less
+Character creation is still there but the upgrades, items and so on, make the game feel deeper and richer
+Combat system is back and even more creative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not a negative but just a heads up for all the ""dumb"" poop and fart jokes

Overall, be confident that South Park: The Fractured But Whole is a great sequel to a stand out game. A lot of us would never have thought that they could make such a great adaptation from TV to Game, but here we are with an even better sequel. Every time the game ended up getting delayed we knew that Matt and Trey didn't think that it was ready and were going to keep working harder and harder on it. Now that it's out, think of it as them saying that we believe it's ready. It's a hilarious game and if you liked the combat in the first one, be stoked that it has only been improved.",multipl delay south park back continu shenanigan left right bat reason gave game five star handl sequel even better first franchis mean first game prove game good show uniqu combat system work 1020 hour stori game take everyth that establish take notch stori full parodi hilari job make fun captain america civil war superhero divid weav pretti fun stori im close 8 hour feel like everyth loot differ part home make want look everyth come poop mini game alway strang entertain let honest write matt trey never let someth hit shelv screen unless exactli want feel polish plu get copi origin game never bad know someon never play first want go back get achiev feel like tip hat u give u origin free head dont watch much south park want get fun year ago lot poop fart joke go take way far keep laugh turn analyt part,1508198400,5

48911,2753,4480,"If this title is representative of the direction Polyphony is going in, this is probably the last Gran Turismo title I'll ever buy.  As of this writing the little warning ""Online Connectivity Required for Most Features"" does not show up on the product images (indicating that they added it last-minute), so before you go lambasting me for crying about having to be online to use most (and I emphasize ""most"") of the games single-player features, keep in mind I wasn't warned about this ahead of time.  I didn't realize how truly crippled Gran Turismo Sport was until I put the game in and a notice flashed up saying that progress couldn't be saved without being connected to the Internet and that the only mode available is ""Arcade"" mode.  I thought ""that sucks, I really liked the campaign mode, but oh well, I can probably live with this"" - that was until I realized that most of ""Arcade"" mode is locked behind the player's campaign level which is impossible to increase without going online.  I can see the images for 30 courses but I'll only ever be able to play 5 of them.  So basically I get about 30 to 45 minutes of quality gameplay and then nothing.  What little there is of the game is gorgeous, but even that is deeply flawed.  The VR mode actually has fewer features than the Drive Club teaser included with the PSVR Demo Disc - for example it's not possible to adjust the view height, steering wheel position and head position.  There appears to be an option to do it, but it's grayed out and doesn't do anything when selected.  I would have been disappointed if this waste of software had cost me $20, but at three times that I'm utterly disgusted.  This barely rates as a demo.

For the record, I have perfectly functional Internet service and plenty of bandwidth.  My reason for not participating in DLC or patches has more to do with being a collector and refusing to give a pass to lazy studios and publishers who want to ship a broken, incomplete product because they have the option of patching it later.  Unlike with PC gaming, that DLC and those patches and fixes are locked behind a proprietary network inside a closed system - in 10 years when Sony abandons PS4 support those patches won't be available, and what's on that plastic disc is all we'll have.  Some people are okay with that, I'm not.  It's shameful and Polyphony needs to be ashamed of what they've done here.  It is either sloppy or sinister to require people to connect to the Internet for permission to use software they've purchased, and neither possibility is acceptable.",titl repres direct polyphoni go probabl last gran turismo titl ill ever buy write littl warn onlin connect requir featur show product imag indic ad lastminut go lambast cri onlin use emphas game singleplay featur keep mind wasnt warn ahead time didnt realiz truli crippl gran turismo sport put game notic flash say progress couldnt save without connect internet mode avail arcad mode thought suck realli like campaign mode oh well probabl live realiz arcad mode lock behind player campaign level imposs increas without go onlin see imag 30 cours ill ever abl play 5 basic get 30 45 minut qualiti gameplay noth littl game gorgeou even deepli flaw vr mode actual fewer featur drive club teaser includ psvr demo disc exampl possibl adjust view height steer wheel posit head posit appear option gray doesnt anyth select would disappoint wast softwar cost 20 three time im utterli disgust bare rate,1508198400,1

After several years, the anxiously awaited Gran Turismo has finally been released for current gen systems on the PlayStation 4. I've been a fan of this franchise since the original release on the PS1 days back in '97. With each development release, the game has continued to grow & improve in my opinion. Gran Turimso Sport finally brings amazing racing simulation, and stunning graphics to the current generation for the 20th Anniversary of the franchise. However, there are some major changes that may not sit well with veterans of the game. The game seems to take a slight step backwards, and doesn't seem very revolutionary this time around. The ""Sport"" in Gran Turismo Sport is positioned as an e-Sport it seems. There's also a significant lack of cars and tracks, compared to other title offerings on the market like Project Cars 2 & Forza Motorsport 7.

Gran Turismo Sport looks & plays absolutely incredible on the PlayStation 4 Pro, on a Curved 4K UHD TV with HDR enabled! Polyphony Digital has recreated every car in fantastic intricate & exquisite detail, both inside and out. I could literally spend hours just looking at every single car, examining each one and soaking in the gorgeous eye candy. Although there are some other excellent titles released for racing on the current gen platform, Gran Turismo is the gold standard when it comes to visuals in this genre. The tracks and scenery are given extreme detail treatment as well, with lighting, shadows, glare, smoke, and particle effects making everything seem genuinely real (of course). GTS shines when compared to the likes of Project Cars 2 (for example).

One of my favorite things that I absolutely positively love about GT Sport (and Gran Turismo in general), is that it teaches me how to drive. It thoroughly explains, and shows in tutorial videos what needs to be done to successfully complete it's driver's school training course. This has not only helped me drive and race better in the game, but it's given me in-depth understanding & insight into the physics of driving in the real world. To me this is one of the most attractive features of this game, and it's a hallmark of the franchise. There's incentive to complete the training too, as it gives experience to level up your GTS account, and it'll also reward you with a gift after each block of training is passed.

There is a large variety of unique cars represented in game, spanning from classes Gr. N (Stock Production), Gr. 4 (Base Level Racing), Gr. 3 (GT3 or equivalent), Gr. 1 (Prototype), Gr. B (Rally), and finally Gr. X (Experimental Concept). Each class is then further branched off into smaller divisions of horsepower from N100 to N1000 in the Gr. N category, but the others adhere to  the strict racing standards set in the real world criteria. With over 160 cars appearing in the game at launch, there's a lot to choose from to suit your fancy. All cars are precisely detailed inside & out. According to series creator Kazunori Yamauchi, the final number of cars for the game will eventually be around 400 to 500. Yamauchi has stated that these additional cars will also be provided in free DLC, and there will not be any micro-transactions included.

The game features three major game modes: Campaign, Sports Mode, and Arcade Mode. The game gives the best experience when it's connected for online play. Arcade Mode will be the only option available if you're unable to connect to the internet (offline), and the game will not progress while playing offline either... so be aware of that new limitation. The franchise's staple offline Career Mode is now gone. The game will also not feature dynamic weather, or a day/night cycle; Track conditions are chosen in the menu. GT Sport also features VR support, and I'll edit my review further when I'm finally able to test out that aspect of the gameplay.

With regards to Career Mode, and the lack of any offline option of itwhich has been a staple of the core structure of the game since it debuted. It seems that GT Sport may be aligning itself more towards the e-Sport aspect of online competitive gaming. Everything you do with leveling up for your profile is attributed to the majority experience of racing in the various modes. Leveling-up is important, because it'll unlock more tracks for you to race on. At Level-20 you'll eventually unlock the famed Nrburgring track for example. Arcade Mode is all about racing against A.I. opponents in Single Race, Timed Trial, 2-Player Battle, etc. Campaign Mode is about Driving School, Racing Etiquette, Circuit Experience, and also Mission Challenges. Sport Mode is where racing online comes into play (especially competitively); you'll be judged on your driving skill, driver level, and most importantly your driving etiquette. I'm personally okay all of these changes, but I suspect many veterans of the series may be left reeling from the hollow feeling of such a change, from the tried and true formula that fans have come know and love.

I've played the game on both the Dual Shock 4 (DS4) controller, and the Logitech G29 Racing Wheel. Needless to say, the racing wheel gives the absolute best simulation, feedback, and experience for racing. A racing wheel makes the game feel and play completely differentit's a thrilling heart-pounding experience to say the least. Although the game can easily be played on the DS4 controller, I highly recommend using the KontrolFreek Speed Freek thumb-stick for better control, and smoother gameplay; You'll thank me later for that recommendation. Overall this game needs to be played with the racing wheel, and it's fantastic how much fun & thrilling it feels to be immersed in the driving experienceit's phenomenal. The game won't punish you for using the DS4 though, so don't let me turn you off from that prospectyou can make adjustments to fine tune your settings.

This game has a lot to offer the casual racer, and hardcore enthusiast alike though. I highly recommend GT Sport, it's a game that needs to be in your library if you're passionate about the genre. The game is great for the novice racer, and as I mentioned aboveit'll teach you everything you need to know to get racing. GT Sport seems to offer less when compared to Project Cars 2 and Forza 7 Motorsport in my opinion, so it may be difficult to justify getting this title. Especially knowing that GT Sport has drastically changed it's game formula, in lieu of e-Sports and online competitive play. However, knowing that Polyphony Digital will be providing free DLC, and a massive livery of new cars and tracks... it's worth considering nonetheless.

I give the game two thumbs way up! The racing experience feels great, it's visually stunning and aurally pleasing. However with other titles with better options on the market, this may a wait-to-buy prospect for some. I'm very happy with my purchase though, and I think GT Sport is a terrific game. Don't let the negative reviews turn you off from this game. GT Sport is about the racing experience & simulation, and it delivers on that statement in my opinion.",overal rate 45 star sever year anxious await gran turismo final releas current gen system playstat 4 ive fan franchis sinc origin releas ps1 day back 97 develop releas game continu grow improv opinion gran turimso sport final bring amaz race simul stun graphic current gener 20th anniversari franchis howev major chang may sit well veteran game game seem take slight step backward doesnt seem revolutionari time around sport gran turismo sport posit esport seem there also signific lack car track compar titl offer market like project car 2 forza motorsport 7 gran turismo sport look play absolut incred playstat 4 pro curv 4k uhd tv hdr enabl polyphoni digit recreat everi car fantast intric exquisit detail insid could liter spend hour look everi singl car examin one soak gorgeou eye candi although excel titl releas race current gen platform gran turismo gold standard come visual genr track sceneri given extrem detail treatment well light shadow glare smoke particl effect make everyth seem genuin real cours gt shine compar like project car 2 exampl one favorit thing absolut posit love gt sport gran turismo gener teach drive,1508198400,5

You're the same New Kid in South Park from the previous game, and you have to battle it out between the different cliques made up of other 8-year-old kids.

There are three main classes (based on the traditional fighter/mage/rogue archetypes in RPGs), and Cartman will give you a combat tutorial that doubles as a tragic backstory (how many Marve/DC heroes do you know of who haven't lost their parents and/or siblings?). There are hilarious moments throughout (such as a group of rednecks that don't take kindly to your ""type"", no matter what you select), and thinly veiled racist and sexist jokes throughout. Keep an eye out for Morgan Freeman's guest appearance: he's awesome.

The combat is grid-based, but your character can move around this time. This allows you to hide in a corner and dish out damage while being protected from most enemies. Arrange your characters properly, and you will be able to wail on enemies while only one or two of them can strike you.

48927,2322,4481,"Hello, I'm N-Game Arts
I've been a part of Gran Turismo from the very first one on PS1.
and I don't hate change and even welcome it at most times... But I do hate change when it was never needed to begin with.

Let me start this off by saying ""Gran Turismo Sport"" is pretty much a Online only game.
it may say ""Internet Required For Most Functionality"" on the front cover of the box, but that's pretty close to a out right lie.
The only thing you can do offline is ""arcade mode"" which would have been fine, BUT unless you have internet you can not Save your progress.
So~ whats the point in even playing it offline then?...

With Gran Turismo Sport near empty on the content we've gotten before and as well no offline mode to speak of, with also still a 60$ price tag... and they them self saying, they have no plans for a Gran Turismo 7.
Polyphony Digital has been on thin ice with me with how awful GT5 and 6 was... but now this is the last straw.
This was just awful to do to hard core fans as well as new comers...

They should have made a GT7 and then later release GTS.
That way all bases would have been covered and not make this confusing release
NO one should have to look up and ""research"" a game they already know and love, to see if it's still THAT.
GTS was a very misleading release and people should be well aware not EVERYONE keeps up with gaming stuff 24/7.

But none of this has to say about gameplay and the overall game. Gran Turismo Sport plays great and feels great,
with smooth tracks, beautiful cars to boot and clean menus to work with... It may only have 162 cars as of this moment, but more cars may be added in future (updates)... with also strong push of online racing and the E-sports world.

but again this another problem I have...
Polyphony Digital not only they take FOREVER to release their next game, but their also never ""Done"" even after so much time... With tons of ""updates"" on the way and as well have no future when the severs get shut down.
Gran Turismo Sport is nothing more then a Could of, Should of, Would of.
A game that will be forgotten after more Race games come out.

I may have high speed internet, but I have no illusions that EVERYONE has it and/or likes to be on it 24/7.
I like to play all my games offline.
I do not do ""DLC"", ""Redeem Codes"", ""Updates"" or ""Microtransactions""
if any of the four things are found in the game, Stars will be lost no matter how good the game is.

GTS gets 1 star for being a pointless installment to the GT games
*Online only
*Next to no content that past games have had
*Nearly out right lying on the front cover
*Great deal of bugs
*Asking 60$ for a half empty game
*No plans for a GT7, (but we get this)
*Tons of updates to a game that should be ""done"" by now
*You can't ""Save"" playing offline
*Removed many of the things that made GT great

Gran Turismo Sport is both a insult to Gamers and the hard working Game Devs who made this game.

These cards are overpriced and should be completely unnecessary. That being said, I didn't even really get to use this product very much because the PS Vita I was using refused to read it. I doubt that it was the card, probably just the fact that the PS Vita was an older one and just didn't want to work since they seem to have a reputation for being finicky and hackable.

48942,365,4478,"The Fractured But Whole has everything we've come to know and love from the South Park series: toilet humor, social commentary and outlandish yet believable storylines. You're the same New Kid in South Park from the previous game, and you have to battle it out between the different cliques made up of other 8-year-old kids.

There are three main classes (based on the traditional fighter/mage/rogue archetypes in RPGs), and Cartman will give you a combat tutorial that doubles as a tragic backstory (how many Marve/DC heroes do you know of who haven't lost their parents and/or siblings?). There are hilarious moments throughout (such as a group of rednecks that don't take kindly to your ""type"", no matter what you select), and thinly veiled racist and sexist jokes throughout. Keep an eye out for Morgan Freeman's guest appearance: he's awesome.

The combat is grid-based, but your character can move around this time. This allows you to hide in a corner and dish out damage while being protected from most enemies. Arrange your characters properly, and you will be able to wail on enemies while only one or two of them can strike you. As you advance, you will be able to unlock DNA panels to upgrade your characters.

48944,4941,1172,"This is where I feel the LOK (Legacy of Kain) series should have started.  Bucking the trend of its predecessor, Soul Reaver is a hack and slash adventure game, where you take on the role of Raziel in order to seek revenge on your evil master, Kain.

The story follows after the bad ending of Blood Omen.  Kain has turned the once proud world of Nosgoth into a barren wasteland of torment and decay.  And he has raised a small band of vampire sons.  The first and most loyal of these is Raziel.  But when Raziel grows wings, and therefore outshines his master, things turn south real fast.  Kain is outraged at this, rather than proud.  He destroys Raziel's wings and throws him into a pit to oblivion.  An eternity later, Raziel is awakened by the Elder, basically the God of the world, and is sent on a quest to slay his demonic brothers, kill Kain, and set things right.

A much stronger story this go around, now let's see if the gameplay holds up just as well.

Like I said, SR is an action adventure game where Raziel must run, jump, glide, and fight his way to his destiny with Kain.  He'll gradually gain new abilties, which affect things in either the material realm or the spirit realm.  Raziel will have to switch between both to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles to advance.  Here's a quick rundown of these abilities.

Faze Through Gates (Spirit World Only) Raziel can faze through gates to get to areas he normally can't.

Soul Reaver (both worlds): basically a sword Raziel can use to dish out major pain on his enemies, but he can only use it if his health is full.  There is an issue with this, but we'll come to that later.

Wall crawling (Material World Only) : Allows Raziel to climb certain walls and get to areas he normally can't.

Force Projectile: (both worlds) Allows Raziel to shoot energy balls at no cost to anything, which can be used to knock pesky enemies into their doom, or to stun them.

Swimming (Material world only): Before getting this, diving into water will automatically revert Raziel to the spirit world, but after you get this, no more of that.

Constrict (both worlds) Allows Raziel to spin things that cannot be spun otherwise, or to crush his enemies.

All of these abilities must be used to overcome the obstacles.  There are also hidden glyphs that give Raziel new powers.  Think of them as special moves which can be helpful in a pickle but cost magic to use.

Combat can be fun but some enemies can either zap you from off screen, jump around you as you're trying to fight them, or both, and that can be annoying, especially when dealing with multiple enemies at once.  I'll just say get used to getting booted to the spirit world.  And this is where the Soul REaver comes in.  LIke I said you can only use it at full health, so if you're dealing with annoying enemies, you can lose it when you really need it.  Enemies are not truly dealt with unless they are burned by fire, impaled on spikes, or thrown in water.  There are other weapons around that can help keep the pace of the game going, but if you use a weapon on an enemy, you must reap his soul before you can pick it up again, other wise he'll get up instantly and you have to redo killing him.

But it's easy to accidentally pick up the weapon when you're trying to punch the other enemies.  In general, combat can be fun, but be prepared for some frustration.  And yes, Raziel needs to absorb souls to regain his health.  He needs to do this in both worlds, as he cannot go back to the material world unless his heath ls full.

So far, Soul Reaver offers a pretty fun experience with just a few flaws that hold it back.  Two more flaws come to mind.  First off, controls are a bit stuff, as it's easy to accidentally walk into a wall and not being able to move until you change direction.  Annoying, but not gamebreaking.  The final flaw I have is that sometimes you have to pull levers, open doors, etc.  Raziel does not always do this when you ask him to, so be prepared to punch the air and such before he stops goofing off and pulls the lever, opens the door, etc.

AS for presentation, that's a bit of a mixed bag.  The visuals are really dark and I had to crank up the brightness on my TV to be able to see what I was doing.  But the voice acting, music, and level design are all very well done, and the characters compliment each other well.  The music really gets you in the mood, but it is kind of forgettable.

In the end, Soul Reaver is a much better outing than Blood Omen, and I would urge you to grab a copy if you can find one for cheap.  If you have a PS3, the game is avalible on the PlayStation store for six bucks.

With that in mind i decided to get the gold edition of this game on the PlayStation store and I have no regrets at all because I'm only 2 hours in and I'm loving every second of the game and I can already tell there's a lot more stuff to do than the first game. I let my girlfriend play it and she played until 2:30am playing the game by herself she is also having so much fun with it, she has more play time than me at the moment. There's literally only one thing about the game I'm not really fond of and that's the loot. I haven't really gotten any items or anything to use for battle which is 70% of what you're doing in the game. I remember in the first game you found so many weapons and could put status effects on them but this game the only weapon you have is yourself so you won't be finding any weapons. Since I'm only 2 hours in I have to assume there are many powers you can unlock so I'm thinking I'll get those to satisfy me. But I just miss getting weapons out of chests and stuff and comparing them to my current weapon and seeing if I could make it better. That's the only thing I dislike about the game.

The game itself is a bit laggy at times, I'm about 7 hours in and still haven't figured out how to join a faction and without joining a faction I get no good armor, can only update a few specs.  Every mission I have at the moment is putting me against people who can kill me in two to three hits.  I really wanted to love this game but so far it has been a big disappointment.  Now I'm going to search the web for any exploits so I can make my character not suck so bad.

UPDATE:
After many more hours of play (lots) and finding an exploit to make more elexit the game still only gets a 2 star rating.  I FINALLY (at level 18) figured out how to join a faction (after having to google who issues the mission and trying to find out why I couldn't turn it in).  The most frustrating thing I've found with the factions is, I don't like any of the factions.  They all are a bunch of A holes and I would love if my character could destroy all of them.  There are other groups in the game I've met that I would much rather join them if there was an option (but there isn't).  The sound effects still annoy me, it sounds like I'm walking in high heels on a concrete floor when I'm walking in snow at times, the sound seems very late 90's style effects.

Since I have leveled my character up a bit it is nice that I can finally attack many enemies and actually do some damage but until you get decent armor (and even then still) you take so much damage from enemies it makes we wonder why I'm wearing armor at all.  I do love the openness of the world but there are still the frame rate lag issues, I've fell through the world a few times, had my companion stuck in the air, and speaking of companions, they are almost completely worthless.

Its probably the most enjoyable open exploration Ive played in a while. Theres just something about the game that's compelling. Think fallout, the witcher, dragon age, and mass effect but it has a uniqueness thats all its own. Forget the trivial negativities that some reviews talk about. This game just simply isn't tailored for everyone. All games have little annoyances and this one definitely has some, but if you can be patient at the beginning and learn how the game plays its really quite fun and worth it. Originally gave 3 stars then 4 and now 5 is my final rating.... A game doesnt have to be tripleA to be great.

Initial Review:
I highly recommend you customize the combat settings after you start new game. The Combat takes some getting used to. It can be frustrating and overly difficult, but you can customize specific combat settings after starting a new game. This makes the combat work more in your favor. I was skeptical to buy because of negative reviews. I ended up watching game broadcasts on psn and found that most of the critical reviews regarding graphics, voice/dialog, and combat appeared to be inaccurate. You can adjust combat settings which makes the combat much more enjoyable. Graphics not top tier but really aren't bad at all. The world seems detailed and vibrant and looks pretty good. Character models appear crisp and detailed. Controls seem fairly smooth but sometimes can be a little ""clunky"". I was actually surprised at how smooth the camera control is. I believe my expectation was lowered because of bad reviews, but controls don't seem to be a bad issue at all. You can also adjust camera distance from your character. You can jump, climb, sprint, and fly with a jetpack. The jetpack works well and is fun to use to navigate around. Climbing a ladder for some reason is extremely slow but instead I just jetpack up there. You can literally jump/fall from just about anywhere and land safely with the jetpack. Voice/dialog seems to work just fine, but sometimes can sound kinda cheesy. Conversations are engaging and come with choices and consequences. You level up and distribute points to your attributes. You can learn skills/abilities. Equip all kinds of weapons, armor, acc, and use many other items. The only cons are graphics aren't top tier but still not bad at all. Combat can feel unbalanced and frustrating if you don't customize your combat settings. Overall the game is good and highly enjoyable. Im glad I didn't fully base my buying decision on negative reviews. If you really like rpg's you shouldnt have any problem enjoying this game.",updat upgrad 5 star deserv idk grown realli love game play 20 hour becom addict combat timingstrategi button mash ive learn combat highli satisfi even kill weak enemi explor world becom excit everi part feel uniqu someth discov night moon crazi huge awesom behold choiceconsequ factor done well find want revisit placespeopl see mayv chang probabl enjoy open explor ive play there someth game that compel think fallout witcher dragon age mass effect uniqu that forget trivial neg review talk game simpli isnt tailor everyon game littl annoy one definit patient begin learn game play realli quit fun worth origin gave 3 star 4 5 final rate game doesnt triplea great initi review highli recommend custom combat set start new game combat take get use frustrat overli difficult custom specif combat set start new game make combat work favor skeptic buy neg review end watch game broadcast psn found critic review regard graphic voicedialog combat appear inaccur adjust combat set make combat,1508371200,5

The story feels like a knock off movie, and the words do not follow the characters mouths. The animations are awful and to see twitching breasts on the female characters is so distracting. I can see where the developers wanted to let you do your own thing in a huge open world like that of Fallout or The Witcher 3, but you will be constantly dying over and over because the combat is way off. You can't even use the special attack when fighting, you have to be completely still, and even then, you'll die. It feels like a very cheap game, but on the other hand I want to keep playing it. I have refunded the game 3 times Via steam, and now I have decided not to touch it anymore. It is just a weird game that I can't say I like or dislike.

49003,4871,4481,"January 2018 update:
The backlash begins.

Not worth it unless you have PSN+, which is required to play online.  It looks like 90% of the content is reserved for online racing.  There are no championship cups to win credits and cars like in the old games.  So fans of prior games in the series are going to be very unhappy.  UPDATE: patch 1.10 gave us a bunch of old school cup races to challenge the AI.  And the AI of cpu controlled cars is better than before.  Added a star to rating.

I have been trying to get the 500,000 bonus credits for pre-ordering from amazon for the past 2 days without success.  At least the bonus 3 car pack did work.  Anyway I am disappointed that amazon did not give all the promised rewards for pre-ordering.  UPDATE: the bonuses were eventually awarded, better late than never.

On the plus side I am hearing good things about the online racing.  Graphics are top notch and cars drive really well.  If they were to add some free dlc with a traditional single player mode the game could be saved.

49023,8688,383,"Since Ezio, no AC production (including Unity) was able to make me emotionally attached to the protagonist and the whole story, until this one showed up. Honestly, it had a bumpy start because I wasn't impressed with the graphics in the first memory and the storyline wasn't really appealing yet. But it soon proved me wrong.
There are too many cool things about Black Flag, but here's the coolest: The protagonist is a total bad-ass (of course), and yet, he's not even part of the Assassins! Instead, he's just the legendary CAPTAIN KENWAY which is a title more awesome than any Assassin honestly. Yes, he goes around and assassinate people in cold blood, but that doesn't take away the pirate inside him, and that's what makes him such a fun guy to play with!
Now, I have synchronized about 90%, highest ever among all the AC games I've played, and the reason is because I just can't get my hands off this game long after completing the main storyline. Normally, I wouldn't even bother to try to finish the side missions because I would get bored so quickly, but with this one I can just go on and on.
And I think a major factor is the efficiency of the map. It's a huge map with so many locations available for you to explore, and yet, it's so easy and convenient to get to these places with ""fast travel"" or just fun sailing times on the ocean.
So there you go, go explore it yourself because you WILL regret it if you don't play Black Flag.

Force feedback is very vague at best (varies from car to car) The fact the game is always online just does not make sense. And there's just no content there, the single-player is basically just training you for the multiplayer. theres only 17 tracks with 40 layouts some of those being just reverse layouts. The only reasons I give it 3 stars is because of one how amazing the game looks on just a standard PS4, it still is fun to drive no matter how bad the physics can be (at times), and it does the matchmaking ranked multiplayer very very well similar to iRacing, so I will personally get my money's worth out of it. Also at this time there are no microtransactions and future DLC such as tracks and cars are supposed to be free.  But if you're going into this expecting Gran Turismo 7 you're going to be very disappointed, but in the games defense they made it very clear that this was going to be an online only racer focused on competition and Esports.

Any PSN code you buy here will not include extra content advertised here. Why? Because of Sony. So please, stop giving this excellent game 1-star reviews because you did not read the description - it's not even fine print, it says it right there with everything else. Stick of Truth was a phenomenal game and I did purchase the disc edition - so I got my digital copy of SoT. I will however not be including that in my review since it plays zero bearing on the merits of The Fractured But While

To predicate this review, I'll explain the criteria I normally use for game reviews. Is it fun? Is it entertaining? Does it stack up to its predecessor? How are the controls? Are there any issues? I will address these individually.

Is it fun?
Yes, absolutely. If you enjoyed Stick of Truth and like South Park in general, you'll get a kick out of the game. The mechanics are very similar to SoT and the game has some more intricate mechanics that SoT never fully actualized. The humor is crass, the story is engaging and not predictable. I found myself playing nearly 24 hours straight before I realized I hadn't eaten. I don't recommend that, by the way - but hey... it happened, and that just proves the game is really fun and engaging.

Is it entertaining?
Well, it's South Park. As I said, the humor is crass, often self-referential. I feel it's impossible to comment on the story, or even the game mechanics without acknowledging the story. If you can enjoy things that a deliberately offensive, you'd be entertained for sure. At the same time, you are currently looking at a review of a South Park game - you know what you're looking at! There's plenty to do and although the animation is simplistic, it holds true to the animation styles of the show and to me, that's important. My roommate actually commented that he didn't realize I was playing a game, thought I was just watching South Park constantly. So, if you enjoy the show - you'll be entertained by the game.

Does it stack up to its predecessor?
The Fractured But Whole completely eclipses Stick of Truth in almost every way. The story is better, the characters more interesting and true-to-concept with their characters on the show. SoT had a disconnect in this area between how characters behaved on the show and how they behaved in the game - most notably with Eric Cartman. This was meant to facilitate learning the game in SoT, but I'm glad they moved past it and preserved the narrative. All in all, top marks on this category, it's way better. It stays true to a lot of traditional RPG elements as well and isn't overly dumbed down mechanically - at least it's not dumbed down to the point of other Triple-A titles... which has sadly become the new standard.

How are the controls?
Takes some getting used to, you can move your hero in battles now so that alone is a huge mechanical change. Out-of-combat controls are more streamlined - which is a very necessary upgrade. Suffice it to say, I found that going from SoT to TFBW was much easier than going from TFBW to SoT, which as far as sequels go is pretty typical.

Are there any issues?
A few. This is perhaps my 10th game in the past year or two that I pre-ordered on launch day and reviewed here. Day one patches are normaly bandaids meant to keep the game playable. Issue I see here is that, at least on PS4, the day one patch is 2.8Gb. That's waaay too big for a Day One patch and didn't inspire much confidence in the game. Despite that, the game performed quite well - which actually makes me grateful they tested it extensively enough to require a 2.8Gb day one patch! I've had 2 crashes in the game thus far, which is VERY low for a new release - especially on a non-pro console. I was downloading/installing several updates for other games during this time, so even those 2 crashes can easily be attributed to something else. All in all, it performs well and the controls have been completely responsive.",want give game appropri amount time actual play write review note buy ps4 digit code amazon worth psn code buy includ extra content advertis soni plea stop give excel game 1star review read descript even fine print say right everyth el stick truth phenomen game purchas disc edit got digit copi sot howev includ review sinc play zero bear merit fractur predic review ill explain criterion normal use game review fun entertain stack predecessor control issu address individu fun ye absolut enjoy stick truth like south park gener youll get kick game mechan similar sot game intric mechan sot never fulli actual humor crass stori engag predict found play nearli 24 hour straight realiz hadnt eaten dont recommend way hey happen prove game realli fun engag entertain well south park said humor crass often selfreferenti feel imposs comment stori even game mechan without acknowledg stori enjoy thing deliber offens youd,1508457600,5

49053,8889,59,"I got this game in a bundle with my ps4 and the campaign was so much and completely addicting. There's a nightmare mode of the campaign with the undead instead of the campaign enemies which is also fun.  I thought multiplayer was fun with the specialists at first, until I played the new Call of Duty Modern Warfare Remastered the multiplayer is amazing and puts shame to the black ops 3 MP. Being stuck as a ""specialist"" and all the players limited to just them is so totally redundant and boring, It is the only flaw I can find in the game.

I played TSoT and loved it so getting this was a no brainer. I'm not terribly far yet but so far I love this one too. It kind of takes place right after TSoT and also after season 21 episode 4. The first few minutes of you playing actually take place during TSoT. This game is real South Park. When you are fighting, someone is always making comments in the background. When you talk to Randy or Cartman's mom, they say and do exactly what they would in an episode. If you try to walk to a part of the game you don't have access to yet, Cartman comes up and says something like ""You haven't yet gained the ability to access the space/time in that area yet"". If you try again he will say something like ""Man, what I'm trying to say is you can't go that way."".

Gameplay

Off the bat I did have some input issues while creating my character, this is surely due to porting to PC from console. I was able to work around it though. Also, it's pretty clear that the use of the mouse was an afterthought and within the game itself, using the mouse is a little awkward. The cursor appears over the game and doesn't hide when not in use and it doesn't really do much. It's only real use is for inspection mode. In your TAB menu and your map, trying to use the mouse is is mildly painful. The game was clearly designed to be played on console without the use of a mouse.

The transitions between cut scene and game-play are seem-less and it is like you are actually in an episode and controlling it. I've been through a few battles at this point and I am still trying to fully get used to it. Each one of your guys has 3 abilities plus an ultimate or use inventory item that can target certain squares in the fight arena. I haven't figured out how to change the order in which they go yet.

As for the guy that gave it a one star review because ""it wouldn't work"". I suspect he just got a PC for the first time and doesn't know how to use it and/or perform basic troubleshooting? I put my code int Uplay and clicked download. As soon as the PLAY button became enabled I was able to click it and play without issue ...

49118,2561,4481,"Straight to the point - As far as the vehicles and environment are concerned, they look incredible. The detail is fantastic, and many times you'll catch yourself thinking ""this looks real!"". Gameplay is what you expect from the Gran Turismo franchise - you have to drive realistically to get trophies, yet for those of us who do not have a full steering wheel rig at home, the game has some driving aids to help you through. Honestly, to me there is really nothing wrong with the actual game itself.

However, I only give it 3 stars because of 3 specific reasons which I'm sure most people will agree with when they play:

1. Car selection is thin!
C'mon Polyphony, compared to other games, this Gran Turismo has a weak selection of vehicles to choose from. Some brands only have 1 car model but 4 different versions of it! That's not what I call a ""selection"". Other games definitely have more cars to choose from, and when it comes down to it, drivers like me want to drive cars - I don't need accurate 4k HDR scale representations of a dashboard. I don't buy driving games to take virtual photos, I buy driving games to drive.

2. No crash damage. Still.
You'd figure by now they would catch up to the other games as far as this feature goes, but no. Gran Turismo keeps calling itself the ""ultimate driving simulator"" and yet they can't even get crashing and crash damage, which is - last time I checked - something that happens all the time when you're racing cars door to door.

3. Constant Internet connection required to save games.
This is really wrong, you're telling me that you couldn't make a game that can save your progress even if your offline and sync it the moment you get connection? What if someone doesn't want to participate in online play? As far as I know, that's the only reason you should need a constant connection. Other games manage this easily,  but apparently the people who made Gran Turismo have other things in mind.",straight point far vehicl environ concern look incred detail fantast mani time youll catch think look real gameplay expect gran turismo franchis drive realist get trophi yet u full steer wheel rig home game drive aid help honestli realli noth wrong actual game howev give 3 star 3 specif reason im sure peopl agre play 1 car select thin cmon polyphoni compar game gran turismo weak select vehicl choos brand 1 car model 4 differ version that call select game definit car choos come driver like want drive car dont need accur 4k hdr scale represent dashboard dont buy drive game take virtual photo buy drive game drive 2 crash damag still youd figur would catch game far featur goe gran turismo keep call ultim drive simul yet cant even get crash crash damag last time check someth happen time your race car door door 3 constant internet connect requir save game realli wrong your tell couldnt make game save progress even offlin sync moment,1508630400,3

49124,6890,105,"An amazing game. Has some bugs you have to work around (PS4) it's in the first brotherhood quest and later on the mission. Here is a partial answer to the bug:
UPDATE! The bug as of Dec. 2017 has been fixed. A great game made even better!! A fantastic game.
PART ONE bug fix: After triggering the 'check fire' bug if one continues the main story quests to The Molecular Level, Virgil give an optional quest objective to talk to the Brotherhood and one will get a map marker to speak to Danse at which point one will have speech options. One needs to tell Danse they are there for help, then say no to his offer to join up, which kicks you out of dialogue, but gives the chance to talk to him again which then has the post 'Fire Support' fight dialogue options, accept there and 'Fire Support' should complete and leave one free to carry on with the Brotherhood storyline.
PART 2 BUG FiX: Also during the mission to get the transmitter, Paladin, just runs away. Just finish the mission alone and the game will reset correctly. Ignore him. (This is a great mission by the way. When the giant rocket engines fire up, it's well, amazing.)
Now that you have this important info let me say that this game is very well done. The story, the art, the many adventures you go on are great. A triple AAA game. You get to customize your character.

Additionally, I received the code lightning fast (good, since it was an ""e-code"") and the instructions that came with it provided a very clear-cut way to redeem the code. This is important as many times I have had issues finding where to go to redeem a code but this removes all uncertainty.

49145,2720,4250,"Somehow, I spent about 50 hours with the game- I can't say I loved all of it, but overall, it's an amazing game.
Good:
-amazing, maybe unparalelled art style, world, and character designs
-no game has unique controls like this, and they feel great (mostly)
-game feels best as a platformer, not a fighter
-a technical masterpiece- solid 30fps with zero drops, just a great looking game technically and stylistically
-amazing soundtrack

Bad:
-Controls during fast paced combat work against themselves, can lead to a lot of frustration
-Too much focus on combat (first game had combat, but it felt less frustrating)
-Lunar/Jupiter styles don't add much- I still mostly used normal style
-characters still speak in stunted, dumb sounding fake language (I wish they would just let them speak Japanese)
-Online aspects being dropped after only 1 year, which means no more Dusty Tokens, which means you'll miss out on some costumes and Talismans

Overall:
I think Gravity Rush is an awesome series that needs to continue- I really hope for a Gravity Rush 3 and beyond. GR2 isn't a perfect game, but I still think this is a must have game for anyone with a PS4.

I can't say that enough, once you get the hang of the wall-running, and the ability to aim and shoot at the same time, when you get it, you got it.
Zombies, for the first time  has integrated with the multiplayer when it come to rewards, keys, salvage, player cards and so on. I personally found this to be a big plus. Once again the four characters go from time shift to another on a new adventure, the best part is you keep you weapons upgrade. Makes it somewhat easier but still has balance.
As for the actual game, I've only played half through, not a big enough fan of the franchise enough to finish.

49152,2720,4437,"I have played probably 90% of the Final Fantasy games, and 12 has always been one of my favorites. I have been wanting, hoping and waiting for a remaster of 12 since the PS3 days, and even though I would have preferred it on pc, at least it's finally here. There's just something about the Ivalice universe that I find really appealing. The story is one of the series best, not focusing on emos, angst, or amnesiacs, but political intrigue- it feels very grown up compared to many other FF games. I enjoy the gambit battle system as well, it's very fast and streamlined. It also has my favorite character designs of any FF by far- I think Yasumi Matsuno's work and style is incredible, I wish we got more of it.

So for the remaster, they did some good things- the remastered graphics look GREAT, although as we all  know the game is still stuck at a paltry 30fps due to the archaic practice of tying gameplay systems to frame rate, meaning you can't just up the frame rate without it having adverse affects on gameplay. This was a typical practice that many Japanese companies did in particular until recently, stopping probably thanks to the reemergence of pc gaming. The 2x and 4x speed up is indispensable now, as FF12 was notorious for it's terribly slow walking speed and large areas- I don't think I could play the game without it now, it makes such a difference (even though it looks ridiculous to be playing a game at double speed- they should have made the whole game run faster to start with). And this being based on the international release, we get the expanded job system- to be honest I could take or leave that part- I don't think it adds all that much to the game. Unfortunately, I hear PS4 Pro support is lacking pretty badly, only maxing out at 1440p- that's pretty inexcusable for a game like this.

But this is one of my favorite FF games, and I feel is a great point to jump into the series. I'm just happy to have my remaster after waiting for it for so many years.

In terms of physical design it is very good. Tom Nook stands on his own without a transparent prop. I like the cross hatch detail on his sweater. He has a large protruding belly which is a nice touch seeing most other amiibo tend to go for the perfect body or super cartoony look.

Main DLC for this amiibo are for Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival and Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer. All other games (mentioned later) are just read only cosmetic dlc.

-Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival
Store save data for the game. Great when playing with friends on different systems
After each match you can save the Happy Points you've collected to your amiibo figure. Save enough points up and you can even unlock new costumes for your character.

-Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer:
Help Tom Nook Design his dream house
Use Amiibo Phone to communicate with him
After you've completed your design, you can save the furniture items you used to the character's card and share them with a friend.

-In terms of other games, you basically get saved ghost data, random common loot drops (sometimes daily), and/or unlockable costumes depending on the game. Here is the list of games compatible with the Amiibo as if this review:

49211,2470,4482,"3/5 stars, here's why:
This game is a monkey's paw. In that everything that seems great seems to have a giant negative caveat attached.

The game is BEAUTIFUL. Except for when it's being ugly at certain times and having massive dips in frame rate or cutscene animations that look so cheesy they make the graphics of the original Halo 1 look breathtaking.

The game gives you a jetpack and the freedom to explore in the BEGINNING of the game. And the world is MASSIVE. 4D exploration in a massive world. This is rare as most games that offer this do it in the middle or near the end of the game. The caveat to this open world exploration? Just be careful not to actually explore anywhere or you'll almost always get murked by something that's insanely overpowered for some reason. (And when it's not overpowered, it just feels that way because of these horrible combat mechanics - more on that below.) Think you can fly away out of danger? Lol no, even the beasts at the tutorial section of the game can shoot projectiles at you, and just about every other enemy the game has to offer does the same.

So speaking of combat, it's horrendous. There's no positive monkey's paw with a caveat attached there; it's just plain BAD. In fact, the combat is so horrendous that all the beauty this game has to offer can't hold a candle because the majority of the game will be spent in combat, and the majority of that combat will be godawful. Projectiles, magic, melee, etc. Everything, when it comes to combat, is a HUGE disappointment that if not fixed very soon will probably be the biggest cause of this game being dead by december.

Back to the monkey's paw: there's so many characters with so many ways to interact with them; but it all feels soulless and bland. I know our guy is supposed to be an alb or however that's spelled, but us, the players aren't. So when there's just emotionless interaction after emotionless interaction, my own investment in the character, the story, and the factions fighting for survival starts to wane.

One final part of the monkey's paw: I purchased the special edition of this game. And the packaging and materials included were BEAUTIFUL. The game itself doesn't feel like it's worth more than $30 and that's if I'm being generous. Before release I was comparing it to legends like Skyrim; now it feels more worthy of being compared to No Man's Sky from my perspective. A lot of exploration but nothing interesting to show for it because the other mechanics are muddling the potential this game has. I hope, like No Man's Sky, the developers see all the mixed and negative reviews as well (most of which have the same criticisms), take them with a grain of salt, and fix what's wrong with this game, because I really do believe this game has a lot of potential.

Do I regret my purchase and my investment in this game? For the moment, yes, I do. Do I have hope that the developers can still fix what is wrong and make this a worthy game for the end of 2017? Yes, I do.",35 star here game monkey paw everyth seem great seem giant neg caveat attach game beauti except ugli certain time massiv dip frame rate cutscen anim look cheesi make graphic origin halo 1 look breathtak game give jetpack freedom explor begin game world massiv 4d explor massiv world rare game offer middl near end game caveat open world explor care actual explor anywher youll almost alway get murk someth that insan overpow reason overpow feel way horribl combat mechan think fli away danger lol even beast tutori section game shoot projectil everi enemi game offer speak combat horrend there posit monkey paw caveat attach plain bad fact combat horrend beauti game offer cant hold candl major game spent combat major combat godaw projectil magic mele etc everyth come combat huge disappoint fix soon probabl biggest caus game dead decemb back monkey paw there mani,1508803200,3

49228,3435,4478,"South Park continues its irreverent and hilarious exploration of video game norms, turning every one on its head. Difficulty is determined by skin tone, ability buffs by fidget spinners, combat by farts and ""pew pew pew"" sounds the kids yell at each other. And you can die and lose in the first 3 minutes.

Combat has changed to a grid based, individual turn driven setup. You're starting classes gradually grow and morph as you establish your superhero backstory, and rather than grind up levels, you gain titles, ability mods and changes to overall strength and strategy by artifacts and other unlocks. This gives not a good reason, but more of a reason to collect friends, use every toilet, and otherwise complete what would otherwise be the normal scattering of fetch quests.

The story continues to deliver on all cylinders. The Coon, noticing a $100 reward for a lost cat, calls off the D&D Stick of Truth game to paly superheroes instead, as Coon & Friends has to overpower the SuperFriends superhero franchise by collecting more sponsors and Coonstagram followers.

Graphics and Sound are South Park standard, with awesome comic style cutaways and jokes pounded into every frame.

As for drawbacks, I genuinely can't find any that matter. Its irritating to walk past areas to can't access because you haven't collected the right story tool, such as the red Lego brick lava, but its not far enough out of the way to be an actual problem. Character development feels slightly stilted to start with, but that's more due to a steady diet of JRPG and Action-Adventure standards than anything else.

Probably the only thing that would've made this better would've been a form of multiplayer, but if this was consumable by a wider audience this would easily be contending for GOTY.",south park continu irrever hilari explor video game norm turn everi one head difficulti determin skin tone abil buff fidget spinner combat fart pew pew pew sound kid yell die lose first 3 minut combat chang grid base individu turn driven setup your start class gradual grow morph establish superhero backstori rather grind level gain titl abil mod chang overal strength strategi artifact unlock give good reason reason collect friend use everi toilet otherwis complet would otherwis normal scatter fetch quest stori continu deliv cylind coon notic 100 reward lost cat call dd stick truth game pali superhero instead coon friend overpow superfriend superhero franchis collect sponsor coonstagram follow graphic sound south park standard awesom comic style cutaway joke pound everi frame drawback genuin cant find matter irrit walk past area cant access havent collect right stori tool red lego brick lava far enough way actual problem charact develop feel slightli stilt start that due steadi diet jrpg actionadventur standard anyth el probabl thing wouldv made better wouldv form multiplay consum wider audienc would easili contend goti,1508889600,5
49229,7057,4478,"Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are excellent for what they do. A quirky, yet funny, and progressive humor in their series and evidently in this game.

Ive never laughed so hard during a video game! For example, when you're choosing the difficulty between easy (white), and hard (black). Its small things like this that are so effective of weeding out people who are overtly sensitive to the sun, wheat allergies, and pretty much everyone.

Southpark creators stated in an interview that they hated everyone equally.

Regardless, I love how well they did with the graphical implementation of their actual southpark world. Ive always wondered what certain aspects of southpark looked like. Within this game, I feel like I see behind the scenes to a show and group of characters weve come to love.

If you're having a bad day, don't forget to pizza. Or else you're going to have a bad time. (Say this is helpful if you get the reference).

If you don't like it, then I hope someone pounds your monkey hole.

The key profile on this keyboard feels lower, which I think ends up leading to a more pleasurable experience.

49250,8443,4326,"Honestly, there is no question that in regards to fantastic video games, Nintendo has been the template of where gamers have been going for over 30 years. But with every great video game system that Nintendo has made like the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo 64, and handhelds like the Nintendo 3DS, there are accessories that are made, which may or may not suite the needs of everybody. In regards to the Nintendo Switch, there have been many different kinds of accessories for the system, but shows that they suit one style of connectivity, either as the Switch as a handheld system or the Switch as a home console. But some gamers do want more. Hori has known that with Nintendo for years. HORI's Tough Pouch focuses in on the Nintendo Switch as a handheld, where you can simply store the Switch in one convenient case. While it is a good and simple idea, it doesn't add-up, especially with all the different ways gamers can play. Also, there could've been some storage space so you can store your favorite Switch titles like Super Mario Odyssey & The Legend Of Zelda: breath of The Wild. Overall, the storage case is a fair buy for the Nintendo Switch, but at the end, it is not the best buy for any hard core gamer.

49254,1893,4455,"Deep Silver tries here, I'll give them that. They try hard, perhaps a little too hard. Let's get into the meat of this review.

Everything I liked about Saint's Row and Gatt out of Hell is entirely missing in this game. The open world is there, sort of. Unfortunately, it's not really an open world sandbox in the truest sense of the word. Sure, you can roam the city in between missions, but other than picking up crystal shards, repeating the same LEGION skirmishes over and over and racing, there's truly nothing else to do. Deep Silver / Volition did keep what seems to be the mission engine from Saints Row 3, but ditched pretty much everything else. I actually liked the superhero aspect of Saint's Row 3, but that was completely stripped from this game. Granted, I haven't unlocked every character yet, but so far I'm not really liking the characters in this game.

Yes, the characters are crazy, looney and Saturday morning cartooney, but they're really not very much fun to play. I preferred the loose style of street recruiting in SR3, the satire, the guns and the outright gang craziness, but that's no where to be found in Agents of Mayhem. In fact, the game is somewhat misnamed as there's very little Mayhem to be had. Mayhem mode in SR3 was trying to destroy as much stuff as possible for money. We don't even get that here. Instead, we get linear missions in pretty much the same underground lair each and every time. The bosses are predictable and while not horribly easy if you try to head-on them, you can get through it with enough time.

Worse, the missions are entirely repetitive using the same dungeon maps over and over. For example, I played the same starting mission at least 3 times in a row before making progress to later missions. I even had to come back and play this mission again later. Not sure what's going on there, but playing the same exact mission over multiple times was not at all fun. I expect repetition in at least some ways in most games, but this was entirely ridiculous. When you do get to the missions, they are either ridiculously hard or ridiculously easy and that entirely depends on how the scenario plays out. For example, one mission I played through, I ended up burning through all 3 of my agents in a minute or two and had to restart the mission. On the second play through (no difficulty level changes), I was able to get through it with one agent in less than 3 minutes. The primary difference was that I was able to use the character's special ability (lb + rb). When the ability chooses to appear seems to be random.

The story ideas are completely forced humor. Meaning, I've only gotten a few chuckles out of the game so far. Though, there was one concept that I entirely liked. Most battles in most games have you run around killing enemies with music and sound effects. However, in this game, when you're out killing LEGION troops, there's a whole separate voice-over narrative running discussing some random thing. These are the few times where I actually chuckled while playing the game. Not only did it take the repetition out of the mission, it allowed you to focus on the voice-over narrative (and jokes) while running around finishing that mission. I really liked this part of the game. This is something that Volition could use as the basis of a new set of games.

Overall, the game is basically Saint's Row 4 completely dumbed down to the point where it's neither fun to play nor funny. The creation of stereotypes that make up the Agents is completely overdone and cliche. The randomness in only allowing 3 agents at a time (when they can switch out randomly) seems to be a miss. If we have 10 agents, then let us cycle through all 10. Why restrict it to 3? Also, unlike SR4 where you could pickup and collect vehicles, you can't do that here. You're limited to unlocking vehicles and even then that's limited. Whatever is on the street is available for limited use, except you can't jack the bad guys vehicles?

Just not impressed by this game. I was hoping for more, but it's really not very much fun to play considering the sameness to the dungeons (lairs). The actual cartoon segments are way out of place next to the 3D environments and the really low frame rate for the cartoons is highly annoying. It kinda feels like I'm playing a game intermixed by a Saturday morning cartoon that's all flash and no substance. I'm giving this game 2 stars. One for trying and one for building a decent city. The missing stars are for the lackluster characters, the lame missions, the way overuse of the same dungeon layouts and the lack of being able to use that open city in a more sandbox kind of way. At least give us one character we can customize. If they had kept more of the feel of Saint's Row here (like the Dubstep gun, character customization and full jacking of cars and customization of them), I would have given more stars.",deep silver tri ill give tri hard perhap littl hard let get meat review everyth like saint row gatt hell entir miss game open world sort unfortun realli open world sandbox truest sen word sure roam citi mission pick crystal shard repeat legion skirmish race there truli noth el deep silver volit keep seem mission engin saint row 3 ditch pretti much everyth el actual like superhero aspect saint row 3 complet strip game grant havent unlock everi charact yet far im realli like charact game ye charact crazi looney saturday morn cartooney theyr realli much fun play prefer loo style street recruit sr3 satir gun outright gang crazi that found agent mayhem fact game somewhat misnam there littl mayhem mayhem mode sr3 tri destroy much stuff possibl money dont even get instead get linear mission pretti much underground lair everi time bos predict horribl easi tri headon get enough time wors mission entir repetit use dungeon map exampl play start mission,1508889600,2

49302,292,2719,"I'll be honest, I don't have much experience in using a headset for chatting.  Nearly all of my voice chatting experience has been on the Nintendo Wii U, by just using the gamepad's mic and speakers.

I've started to game online on my PS4, and while I appreciate that Sony includes a mono ear phone and mic, it's extremely uncomfortable.  I prefer either silicon tipped earbuds or over the ear headphones. I picked these up and while I haven't had them for long, I'm happy with them so far.  They feel comfortable, the sound is decent (channeling in-game audio to them), and voices come through clear as well.

On those points; Comfortable as these are, I do see myself having sweaty ear issues during long gaming sessions with these on.  Not only do I hear my friend's voice more clearly, but he says my voice comes through much more clearly in comparison to the set included with the PS4.  To use his words:  ""Yeah, it's like night and day between those and your old one"", so this has helped other gamers hear me better.

Just for kicks, I plugged in the USB connector and checked out the lights.  Yeah, it looks cool, but I think the headset would be better off without them.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the main cable from the headset splices so close to the end of the cable, you literally need to sit next to your console to plug in, unless there's a wall outlet or a device with USB ports closer to where you prefer to sit while gaming.  The LED's add weight, and if you were to game for a while with them turned on, that would generate more heat.  As I said earlier, I already worry my ears will get sweaty with these on long gaming sessions, I certainly don't want to add factors to worsen that.

At the end of the day, I'm still happy with these at this point though.  Yeah, I'm sure there's other headsets that don't have the features I griped about, but the overall aesthetics, combined with a high review score, is what drew me to these, and so far I don't regret my choice.",ill honest dont much experi use headset chat nearli voic chat experi nintendo wii u use gamepad mic speaker ive start game onlin ps4 appreci soni includ mono ear phone mic extrem uncomfort prefer either silicon tip earbud ear headphon pick havent long im happi far feel comfort sound decent channel ingam audio voic come clear well point comfort see sweati ear issu long game session hear friend voic clearli say voic come much clearli comparison set includ ps4 use word yeah like night day old one help gamer hear better kick plug usb connector check light yeah look cool think headset would better without review point main cabl headset splice close end cabl liter need sit next consol plug unless there wall outlet devic usb port closer prefer sit game led add weight game turn would gener heat said earlier alreadi worri ear get sweati,1508976000,4

49391,256,4332,"Story.

Plot and theme is similar to a Pinocchio or Blade Runner where an intelligent non-human species (Andriods in this case) created by humans question if they have a soul, and  contemplate if their memories considers them sentient beings and on par with humans.

Story goes like this: aliens invade earth with robots or machines, and humans have to escape and colonate on the moon where they build Androids and send them out to eradicate the robots. The majority of robot have low IQ but are very abundant. Throughout the story you play 3 of these Androids set on missions to destroy these robots for the humans.

Story comes in 3 acts and can be philosophical at times, especially when the protagonists see robots do things of intelligent nature or things outside their designated roles . First act focuses on Android 2B, and the second act plays out the same as the first one except you're in the perspective of Android 9S. The gameplay is not exactly the same as 9S has a hacking mechanic, and during the first act, the two get separated at points. When the two stories intersect you do get similar dialogue. Third act continues from the ending of the first and second, and introduces a third character you can play as. Unlike the first two acts you switch between characters instead of focusing on one. All three acts can last 25+ hours depending on difficulty you select, and how many side quests you decided to do

-Gameplay.

A combination of open world hack-and-slash (similar to Bayonetta or DMC) and shmup (shoot em' up) of the bullet hell variety.

I like how they mix the two gameplay styles very well in terms of pacing them out, with different viewing angles (top down, side scoller, free roam, etc), and mini-games to keep you very intrigued without being dull and repetitive. Also the upgrade skill and weapon mechanic keep things interesting also.
so
The world is big, but you'll be traversing the same areas from time-to-time especially when playing a new acts. So same sandbox, different story

There are tons of invisible walls, rubble, buildings, and restricted doors/chests/elevators that block your progress. For the first 3 it can be frustrating especially when you have to go around them and take the scenic route especially when you're focused on the objective marker. For the latter 3 those are restricted via story progression or specific character unlocks.

Once you get familiar with the world, and when they introduce the teleport checkpoint mechanic; you get used to it and its less of an annoyance

Difficulty level range from ridiculously easy to impossible. On easy mode, the characters you play dodge on their own so it's only the matter of positioning yourself well and button mashing without consequence. Good for those who just want to experience the story.  Hardest mode is one hit kill form any enemy with no auto dodge, so you have to get used to being a glass cannon, or have to constantly restart from where you last saved.

-Presentation

Graphics are really good and frame rate is smooth throughout. Personally, I don't like the dark green, grey and white color scheme as it reminds me the early days of the PS3, Xbox 360 era, but the art direction is excellent

Music is excellent with orchestral music

Voice acting is also really good. Only tried the default English since the Japanese voice track can be distracting since characters have conversations during combat, and this game is very twitch and timed (button presses) heavy especially on high difficulty settings.

Characters are good, the main characters play out well acting like androids with a conscious and talk like real people. Villains can be over dramatic, but don't go into the cliche territory. Each character has their own personality and maybe aside from the villains; not one dimensional and you can see the motives behind their personality

-PSN trophies

Easy platinum.

After you complete the 3 main acts, you can purchase trophies via in-game money, or get them the natural way.

If you do the former, I would make multiple save files and save over them once you make the trophy purchase(s) (since it autosaves*) to minimize money grinding. Steps:

1. Before making purchase make 2 or 3 same save files. Play one save file and make a lot of purchases
2. Load a fresh save
3. Save over the auto save file
4. Make more purchases
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you sold out of all purchasable trophies

After you've done that, you have two more trophies to collect (non purchasable) which are the

'Leaving for the New World' or 'Beautiful World' (depending on which ending you select in act 3, have to replay via chapter select and pick the other one), and the 'The Minds That Emerged' trophy that technically deletes your save file. If you wait on the option screen for 'yes' and 'no' for a few seconds, the trophy along with platinum trophy will pop up and you can select 'no' if you want

*Only time the game auto saves. All other times you have to save via designated safe zones (that doesn't interfere with plot/story), or vending machines

Overall, a blast to play with gameplay variety and good story.

When I received these i tested it for a while and I received some mixed results.
When tried on a ps2 it worked incredibly well. Its sharp, clear and the audios pretty good. It worked well for games like Red Dead Revolver, Metal Gear solid 2, The Warriors and worked incredibly well with ps1 games too especially when using the smoother. The only set back o saw from ps1 games on the ps2 was that they had a slight checkerboard pattern. You cant notice it from a distance on smaller monitors but you might on bigger ones. The checkedboard patter also happens a bit on ps2 games but nowhere near as often as on ps1 gamss.

Now when i tested it on a ps1 it acted a bit strange. For the first 5 mins it worked fine but then the letters on the screen started shaking a lot. Also its pretty hard to put the plug inside the port behind the ps1. I had to jiggle it left and right a bit like you normally would with a key that doesnt want to fit through a hole.

Now a few days later I purchased a Sony Branded PS3 S-video cable and tried it on my ps2.
It worked amazingly well. I put a ps1 game in and the checkerboard pattern was gone completely.
When i tried it on a ps1 however it did gave me the same results as it did with the the 3rd party cable but not as often. I think its because the port might be dusty so i most likely have to clean it out a bit.

These 3rd party cables weren't that bad when compared to the Sony Branded cables. I think id rather use the sony branded cable on the ps1 since it slided in much easier then with the 3rd party cable.

Would I recommend this?

49415,3418,2048,"It's actually a pretty solid controller.  It may seem like a weird concept for a product, but for those of us who grew up playing GameCube and loving its controller, this is a great sort-of-doppelganger with/for a modern setup.

Build quality is good overall, nothing feels flimsy or loose.  The analog sticks and bumpers are a bit stiff but not bothersome.  The face buttons protrude from the faceplate pretty aggressively which, again, is quite reminiscent of the GCN controller.  It's an acquired taste for a lot of people but frankly I've never stopped loving having really prominent face buttons.  One complaint I do have is that the analog sticks have a slightly bigger inherent deadzone than I'm used to, but even with that minor annoyance I still really like using this controller, even for games like TrackMania which demand a lot of analog stick accuracy.

The small shape bodes really well most of the time.  It fares really well when playing button-mashy and combo-heavy games.  Personally, I've been playing THUG Pro on it and it is absolutely perfectly fit for that task (largely because I'm so used to play Tony Hawk games on a GCN controller).  Claw-gripping this thing is also far more comfortable than the XB360, XB1, DS3, or DS4 controllers in my opinion.  The only time I've found the shape to be a hindrance is when using both analog sticks simultaneously.  Part of this is because I have big hands, but again, I still prefer using this controller most of the time regardless.

All in all I'd say this was well worth the purchase.  It doesn't matter if you have big or small hands, this controller is fit for just about anyone.  If you like the GameCube controller and want something kind of similar that can play modern games, then you should definitely get this.",actual pretti solid control may seem like weird concept product u grew play gamecub love control great sortofdoppelgang withfor modern setup build qualiti good overal noth feel flimsi loo analog stick bumper bit stiff bothersom face button protrud facepl pretti aggress quit reminisc gcn control acquir tast lot peopl frankli ive never stop love realli promin face button one complaint analog stick slightli bigger inher deadzon im use even minor annoy still realli like use control even game like trackmania demand lot analog stick accuraci small shape bode realli well time fare realli well play buttonmashi comboheavi game person ive play thug pro absolut perfectli fit task larg im use play toni hawk game gcn control clawgrip thing also far comfort xb360 xb1 ds3 ds4 control opinion time ive found shape hindranc use analog stick simultan part big hand still prefer use control time regardless id say well worth purchas doesnt matter big small hand control fit anyon like gamecub control want someth kind similar play modern,1509235200,4

Simply put, this is the best Tomb Raider game. Reminiscent of the Uncharted series without the wit, this game provides a gripping story, amazing graphics, and smooth gameplay. Tomb Raider has come a long way since the bouncing days, and now we have a strong female protaganist and fulfulling secondary characters. Once I started playing I couldn't stop, and had a couple of late nights.

Campaign takes about 24 hrs to get all of the pick-ups, DLC Blood Lines is worth it while Laura's Nightmare is not. Blood Lines provides excellent story background and the ability to tour Croft Manor. Laura's Nightmare is it's own take on a Zombie shootout but is not very fullfullling. The only down side to this game is the use of ""cards"" and is essentially meaningless for after campaign gameplay.

Once the campaign is over there is replayability with higher difficulty settings, speed runs which this game does an excellent job organizing, and endurance challanges - survival modes and the like.

Rating: 9 out of 10. Highly Recommended.

49460,8933,4480,"l will list the pros and cons for the game, but if you want a short read: ALL BAD IS MADE UP BY THE GOOD.

Pros and cons (starting with cons)

CONS:
A LOT LESS CARS. gran turismo 6 had i think around 1200 cars.(correct me if im wrong) this however has a LOT less cars.

NO MORE TUNING SHOP. honestly this isn't too much of a con, considering you CAN upgrade your cars using the level up in car settings, but it doesnt cost money, it costs mileage points.

A LOT LESS TRACKS.there are not very many tracks. the number is so small it makes me sad. no more Daytona, De La Sarthe, Spa, not even the special stage where the track is straight for like 9 miles. honestly very dissapointed.

LONG LOADING TIMES. loading times are not that bad but it still is a little bit annoying.

LACK OF CAR DIVERSITY. all cars are either race cars or sporty street cars. with only a small number of crappy hatchbacks or whatever. AND there is only ONE car that is older than 2009.

ONLINE. the game is only online. and it sucks. the driving school, mission challenges and some other thing that I forgot the name of is not online however. neither the arcade mode.

NO B-SPEC. I am very lazy. i like to just set a driver on a race and then go do something else while the dude is racing. well, I can't do that anymore.

PROS:
MILEAGE POINTS. some people might not like them, but I, however, DO. you get them from driving. the longer you drive for, the more you get. its kind of a new currency. you can use them to buy new paint colors, like for example chrome. and you can also get different decals, driving suits and helmets, special cars you can't get from the dealership, driver poses, and rims. it is actually VERY cool when you view the game as NOT gran turismo 6.

GRAPHICS. now i thought the graphics where going to not be as good because i only have a standard PS4. but I was VERY wrong. the graphics are awesome. not amazing, but MUCH better than gran turismo 6.

CAR AND TRACK QUALITY. following on the whole graphics thing, there is an amazing amount of detail to each car and track.

DRIVING SCHOOL AND MISSION RACES. these are thing you can do NOT online. they are actually pretty fun.

ARCADE MODE. arcade mode is awesome in this game. before, it was just racing for fun. now, you can earn money, daily miles, mileage points, and experience points from arcade mode, AND you can change the penalties, number of laps, how many minutes/hours you want to race for, number of cars, what position you start in, difficulty, mechanical damage, tire wear, and fuel consumption. its awesome.

GAME FEEL. I think this game feels awesome. it would probably be better if i had a wheel but whatever.

RACING FLAGS. if you, or somebody else crashes, you will see a yellow flag go up. if everything is fine, its green. AND the AI racers will slow down near a crash. just a cool little feature.

NEW TIRE TYPE. in the past, the best tires you can get where racing:soft tires. now there is racing:super soft tires. its pretty sweet.

LIVERY. it is awesome!

SUMMARY:
I could go on and on about this, but I don't want to spoil too much. the whole thing with the upgrades is you CAN upgrade the car. you have to go into car settings, and you will see either one or two things that say level up. one is for upgrading power. and the other is for weight reduction. you can't upgrade your cars with money however, it takes mileage points. you don't need to buy better tires for your cars either, its just there and you can switch to it. READ THIS: I had a problem with the game screen not completely filling the tv screen. the solution is you have to exit the game, go into playstation settings, screen and audio, and adjust the thing to fit your screen. in the game you can earn XP, mileage points, and I think even money from completing achievements. playing with people online is ok. its not the greatest. when online, you can only use the car you are currently using. you cant change while in the server (at least i don't think so). overall, you should buy this game. it IS actually fun. ITS NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS IF YOU KEEP IN MIND THATS IT IS NOT GRAN TURISMO 6, AND THAT IS IS STILL A VERY NEW GAME AND COULD GET BETTER WITH UPDATES AND STUFF.

49486,8935,2692,"It's certainly not the strongest in the Star Ocean series, however it's not the weakest either.
I got major SO3 vibes from this game and it felt great to control your character. At first, I thought the multiple characters would cause gameplay issues (like being too distracting or making the game lag) but they pulled it off really well. It feels like everyone has a place and everyone contributes in their own special way.
In order to optimize your team, without using a strategy guide or walkthrough, you're going to have to spend hours in preparation. A lot of people may be turned off by this, but I loved the planning and execution mechanics this added. You'd really be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring this part of the game by using a guide.
Still, this game does have two pretty significant weaknesses. The first is the main story isn't very large. This isn't the problem, per se, as the hours upon hours of sidequests make up for that, however this does mean there's not a lot of exploration. The world map is *very* small. The second problem is they referenced the previous games far too heavily, especially in the character aspect. They mixed and matched characters from previous games to make the characters you play as in this game. The major problem with this is none of the characters feel natural or intuitive (except Emmerson) and they never took into consideration how mixing those characters might also mix and confuse the themes those characters represent. In the end, none of the characters really feel new or like they have their own style, contrary to previous Star Ocean games, even SO4.",certainli strongest star ocean seri howev weakest either got major so3 vibe game felt great control charact first thought multipl charact would caus gameplay issu like distract make game lag pull realli well feel like everyon place everyon contribut special way order optim team without use strategi guid walkthrough your go spend hour prepar lot peopl may turn love plan execut mechan ad youd realli disservic ignor part game use guid still game two pretti signific weak first main stori isnt larg isnt problem per se hour upon hour sidequest make howev mean there lot explor world map small second problem referenc previou game far heavili especi charact aspect mix match charact previou game make charact play game major problem none charact feel natur intuit except emmerson never took consider mix charact might also mix confus theme charact repres end none charact realli feel new like style contrari previou star ocean game even so4,1509408000,4

My only complaint is that the lighting is motion sensitive so bumping it at all will turn on the lights under the keypad for a short while. It has a curved base so it doesn't sit flat either and is easy to rock left or right.

It was a bit humorous but not nearly as funny as they had been expecting.  The said the character classes took a dive from the previous release and while you do develop a character sheet during gameplay it doesnt even impact the game. One thing that did get better was the combat mechanics. You can actually move around rather than staying in place. It took them less than a week each to finish the game. Overall they both recommend it and say its a solid four star game but misses the five star mark.,son wait game husband enjoy agre fell short five star mark bit humor nearli funni expect said charact class took dive previou releas develop charact sheet gameplay doesnt even impact game one thing get better combat mechan actual move around rather stay place took le week finish game overal recommend say solid four star game miss five star mark,1509408000,4

49511,906,4482,"Elex is an offline single player open world game made by a smaller independent team, so I'm grading it based on the fact that they don't have all of the resources of a AAA developer. With that in mind, Elex is a brutally tough game to start, even on easy mode, since exploring beyond the initial areas will lead you to encounter enemies that will kill the player in one hit. The good news is, I explored the entire map with only a basic, weak axe, and managed to outrun nearly all of the enemies. Unless you keep running and make sure you don't equip your weapon (it auto locks you into a battle if you have a weapon equipped), then your character will die often and the game will load often with the loading screen to reset your position. I wouldn't complain, but the map markers and mission structure takes a lot of getting used to, as things aren't always clearly set out. The menus and map screens sometimes slow the game down to a crawl for some reason.
The game controls well enough, with 3 great camera views, over the shoulder, mid and far range views, each of which is helpful and appreciated. The close up view is great for exploration and getting the sense that you're part of the world. The mid and far views are very useful for combat and watching for enemies, but also getting a sense of the scale of the giant world filled with lots of terrain variety from deserts, small forests, snow mountains, lush greenlands, cliffs, Fallout like camps, futuristic structures, and more. I was hoping to find a giant city in the game, but they are more like single structures where inside, you discover a city like interior instead, with the Clerics base being a good example. Otherwise, you'll find villages for the most part.
The jet pack is a lot of fun as it lets you jump off cliffs (or climb them) that you would never survive in another game. Freefall just till you're about to hit the ground and hit your jet pack to soften the landing. Very cool and makes this game very unique. Clearly it's been inspired by Fallout 4, and pays homage to the game with the Outlaw group, with one woman even saying the word ""Fallout"" during dialog.
Elex has graphics that are really nicely done at times, but other times, just average or decent, so it varies. It's a fun world to explore, and after you complete enough missions and eventually get some gear and weapons to defend yourself with, it opens up the possibilities. The combat is real time and easy to get the hang of, but feels a bit clumsy at times due to the auto lock. You can use a shield but it takes stamina when its hit, and you can't attack in response without stamina, so you have to dodge some attacks to survive.
The day/night cycle takes a very long time, so that's cool as you enjoy the day light or night setting. You can change the time of day by resting, which is great.
If you like open world games, this lets you explore every area right from the start, but prepare to run often from overpowered enemies with the generous run stamina button (L3). The enemy variety is not great, and you'll often see the same enemies throughout the entire world, such as raptors, giant rats and chicken raptors for example. Not bad, but it could use some flying enemies too early on. A very good, fun open world game worth checking out if you enjoyed Gothic or the Arcania game also on PS4.",elex offlin singl player open world game made smaller independ team im grade base fact dont resourc aaa develop mind elex brutal tough game start even easi mode sinc explor beyond initi area lead encount enemi kill player one hit good news explor entir map basic weak axe manag outrun nearli enemi unless keep run make sure dont equip weapon auto lock battl weapon equip charact die often game load often load screen reset posit wouldnt complain map marker mission structur take lot get use thing arent alway clearli set menu map screen sometim slow game crawl reason game control well enough 3 great camera view shoulder mid far rang view help appreci close view great explor get sen your part world mid far view use combat watch enemi also get sen scale giant world fill lot terrain varieti desert small forest snow mountain lush greenland cliff fallout like camp futurist structur hope find giant citi game like singl structur insid discov citi like interior instead,1509494400,4

49578,5220,4175,"Steep is a game that for all of it's good qualities, it will show you it's flaws at the same time. First off, you need an internet connection for this game to work. Next, you'll need Xbox Live for multiplayer. Visually, Steep looks great. The sky/sun glare, the mountains, the way the snow reacts and crumbles to the board or characters movements is just plain awesome. But get up close to the trees or the ice and you'll feel like your playing 1080 on the N64. You do have some options with the clothes you wear and your board but I didn't bother too much with that. Each event is fun and offers a nice challenge, some events you'll find yourself replaying a few times to beat but nothing that makes you rage out or get frustrated with. Free-roaming the mountains is a blast and allows you to take in some visually pleasing scenes while exploring different terrain and learning new tricks naturally. Which is a good thing because the controls are a bit wonky and take some getting used to.

Pros:
-Scenery is visually pleasing and sets the mood and tone for each area of the map really well.
-Character clothing options are pretty good.
-The sound of snow crushing beneath your board or skies, the sound of the wind as you fly, the ambient sounds of the woods really help pull the player into the game.
-Achievements aren't terribly hard to get.

Cons:
-The controls aren't all that great.

I only really played COD 4 remastered which I still to this day play. COD remastered looks awesome and still has that classic feel to it. I can still pop that game in and play it for hours without really paying attention to the time with my buddies.

Infinite Warfare on the other hand is your regular run and gun type of COD game. Not a huge fan of it due to all of the unrealistic futuristic gunplay and how you actually play the game. Had I waited and known, I would have just got COD 4 remastered when it came out.

Overall I give the game 5 out of 10. Basically 5 out of 5 for COD 4 remastered.

49584,8951,1193,"Uncharted 4 is a great game within a great series. Great gameplay, great looking, great acting. The story of Nathan Drake takes a few twists and turns. Some that this veteran gamer did not expect to happen. The game overall looks stunning. I don't think it can look better then this. This game takes you through a various amount of areas of the world and as expected Naughty Dog does an amazing job of showing that on the screen of how amazing they can make it look. The story is solid and keeps you drawn in throughout the entire time you are playing. I personally have played through the game three times now. It is like watching one of your favorite movies over and over you just never get bored with it.

The sounds within the voice acting, the graphics, and the gameplay all are home runs with this game. Getting the collectors edition you get an awesome statue as well as some concept art and the sound track. It all comes in a cool unique case which makes it fun to display for all of your friends. You also get some in game content as well which is also a home run in my opinion. The multiplayer makes a come back which is also hours of fun no matter what style of multiplayer you enjoy playing. Survival myself and me and my buddies can play for hours.

I can't say enough just how awesome this game is to play. If you haven't picked this up yet, do yourself a favor. Grab Uncharted the Nathan Drake collections and then this. Take a week away from work and school and just truck through them all. From the funny comments, to the easy to use game play to the stunning graphics. You won't be disappointed.

49585,8951,3621,"Destiny was one of those games that I picked up based off of what my friends were pressuring me to do. After getting the game I was quickly sucked in to the main story mode. However, the story is quick and easy to plow through especially if you have friends who you can play with who have already beaten it. It is after the story that the game takes its true form and shows you how much fun it can be.

While traveling from planet to planet with your friends you encounter different enemies, cool and unique weapons and people. New gear as well as hard to find items that help you rise the ranks and get to a better level. However, with that being said I found it difficult to really find any of those items. It seemed the only way this would happen is if you didn't have much time and you just basically grinded out the same area until you found what you were looking for.

Once you basically beat all of the strikes and raids it became repetitive. Still a fun game to play with friends. Now that Destiny two is out I am going to wait until I really have a good reason to grab it. Or a good price drop.

But my wife really likes South Park, and I really enjoy the South Park movie.  This game's graphics are superb.  It literally looks like you are watching an episode of South Park, and those who walk by may think it's just that.

For that, I was much more interested than I normally would have been as I'm a huge fan of both and love superheroes!  The game can be really funny at times, but some other jokes fall flat.

49605,8951,604,"This is my first review in a long time. Hopefully this helps any and all wishing to purchase this version of the game or the game in general.

I have always been a Fallout fan starting with Fallout 3 back in the day with my X-box 360. Then I obviously played Fallout New Vegas and now Fallout 4. I have to say, the jump to the next gen consoles went very well for this specific game. It isn't as glitchy as I remember the older games to be. The game looks very good given the type of game it is. For the type of game it is I never really held the game designers too much of a high standard due to the type of game and world they are trying to convey. For example, if you are buying this game expecting graphics like you would see in lets say, Grand Theft Auto. You aren't going to get that due to the world this is trying to depict.

You start off as the wanderer of the wasteland, much like every other fallout game you are by yourself sifting through a vast land of fallout nuclear waste. I for one enjoyed the main story line as it sucked me in and it kept me with it until the very end. It took me a while to get around to playing Fallout as I was finishing some other video games as well. However, when I finally got on board and started playing, much like other Fallout games I was unable to put it down for longer then a day as I really wanted to see what happened next. The main story is awesome; it really pulls you in and keeps you busy until you have completed it. Once this is complete there are still numerous side quests that you can complete as well as going back to older settlements that you've already cleared to help them out when under attack. I have to admit sometimes that gets a little annoying but fun nevertheless.

This version of the game comes with a cool pip-boy as well as a steelebook of the game. Some cool notes as well which I enjoy. Fallout and Assassins Creed are really the only games I pay the extra money for when it comes to collectors editions because you seem to get the best bang for your buck with these versions.

I don't want to go into to much just in case you haven't actually played the game yet. I DID NOT download or play any of the DLC so this review is based off of the regular stand alone game. However, if you are in the market to pick up the game and don't want to purchase the Pip-Boy edition the G.O.T.Y version is the way to go. You get everything the regular game has to offer alone with all of the additional DLC.

Overall I give them game a 7.5 out of 10. The game itself is awesome; the graphics are good but still look a little like New Vegas and Fallout 3 to me. The music is great and commentary is awesome. The main story is fun to play along too, the side quests are fun as well but they do tend to get a little annoying as well.

With any and all projects like this it is always important to ensure that everything looks and plays smooth and brings back memories of the old games.

This series of games does live up to the hype and is a staple in any gamers library of games. If you haven't played these games before or maybe you are looking for something new and exciting this is the way to go. The voice acting is by far the best you will find in any game that is out there. There is just a sense of realism with these games that when they talk I feel it is how I would react and act in these situations. The gameplay it self is easy to get used to and easy to pick up.

49643,2569,1841,"I can't believe, at the time of this review that being mine, it's been 10 years since Activision decided to reboot Call of Duty to go modern warfare and beyond up until last year's probably final ""Modern"" entry Infinite Warfare (2016, PS4/Xbox One/PC,etc.). So 10 years later, the game that started this trendy era of COD games is just as I figured it would be, a FPS juggernaut masterpiece. Of the 3 Modern Warfare games in it's trilogy (2007-2011), this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

I remember back when I was in High School in '07 and when I read reviews for this on IGN, Gamespot and so on, I couldn't bear to understand why is every gamer and critic was praising Modern Warfare 1 giving it all straight 5 out of 5s and 10/10s. Now I know why, you would think after 2006's Call of Duty 3 (PS2/Xbox/PS3/Xbox360/PC/Wii), gamers were starting to get bored and tired of war based games being in focus of covering WWII well this game changed the landscape of this just like how Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight changed the landscape of superhero cinema and how Michael Bay's first Transformers film (same year this game came out) changed the way how dumb popcorn action flicks and general hollywood blockbusters should be nowadays. It's part of #KeepingUpWithTheTimes #ForgetThePast.

Modern Warfare is intense and jammed packed with fast shooting, intense gameplay, brutal combat, concise gameplay and story, well rendered battle enviroments, and the multiplayer mode types that tend to, since this one, to be repeated in use in almost every Call of Duty following this one which was why I was so sick and fed up with this Modern COD stuff everyone was going for everywhere online. Now 10 years later, Call of Duty WWII has/is come out and we are back to the era that made Call of Duty famous since 2003 and when it put my former favorite FPS war franchise (Medal of Honor) to death.",cant believ time review mine 10 year sinc activis decid reboot call duti go modern warfar beyond last year probabl final modern entri infinit warfar 2016 ps4xbox onepcetc 10 year later game start trendi era cod game figur would fp juggernaut masterpiec 3 modern warfar game trilog 20072011 wasnt bad thought would rememb back high school 07 read review ign gamespot couldnt bear understand everi gamer critic prais modern warfar 1 give straight 5 5 1010 know would think 2006 call duti 3 ps2xboxps3xbox360pcwii gamer start get bore tire war base game focu cover wwii well game chang landscap like christoph nolan dark knight chang landscap superhero cinema michael bay first transform film year game came chang way dumb popcorn action flick gener hollywood blockbust nowaday part keepingupwiththetim forgetthepast modern warfar intens jam pack fast shoot intens gameplay brutal combat concis gameplay stori well render battl enviro multiplay mode type tend sinc one repeat use almost everi call duti follow one sick fed modern cod stuff everyon go everywher onlin 10 year later call,1509667200,4

But I decided to give Titan fall to a try because I like the idea of it plus there haven't been very many good robot style games for the PlayStation. The single player campaign was rather good. Verticality was well done and the characters were all fairly likable . Some of the villains were a little too dimensional but in the end they were still not bad. The character of BT 7274 was actually probably my favorite character. My only wish being that he would been voiced by Peter: the voice of Optimus prime.

 In my mind the only real thing that the single player campaign wax is a dedicated new game plus mode. The game allows you to unlock different loadouts for your Titan. Unfortunately after you beat the game if you start again the loadouts are not available and you have to unlock them all over again.

49664,7442,3413,"Pros:
--Primary hub of Prague is quite detailed and fun to explore
--Many different weapons and aug choices to suit all playstyles
--Hard to pinpoint but something about the atmosphere of this entry in the series feels a lot like the original Deus Ex on PC (2000)
--The environment allows for some fun and sensible outcomes.  Coax someone into shooting at you within range of the police, for example, and police will respond to the threat and take him out.  You can enter most apartments but police will be aggressive if they see you breaking in.
--Exploration is rewarded (perhaps a bit too much)

Cons:
--Even on the hardest difficultly, DX:MD is just so damn easy.  AI behavior is extremely simplistic and the ""distract by throwing a trash bin"" tactic is sadly just about all you need to succeed on a stealth play through.
--Similar to the above, resources are way too plentiful.  Half hour into the game your inventory will be maxed out with Granades, ammo, health packs and energy cells.  You never have to worry about conserving resources.
--Praxis points are far too easy to obtain.  I had pretty much every aug I wanted By the time I was 25% through the main story.  You never have to commit to a play style because you easily earn enough exp to unlock augs for every style.
--While there ARE multiple ways to reach each objective, almost every time one of these ways is through a painfully obvious, cartoonishly large air vent that conveniently circumvents security for an area.  This seems lazy to me but it is reminiscient of the original Deus Ex so hard to fault the devs too much.

49668,2280,383,"This review is for the PS4 version.

After initially completing the Ezio Collection, I was hooked on the series and recently purchased Black Flag along with some of the other AC series.  I probably should not have played and completed Syndicate though prior to playing this one as I have gotten use to the smooth character movement and (even though some people didn't like it) the grapple hook that Syndicate has.

Like the Ezio collection, the controls for Black Flag are awkward to me as I tend to grab and jump onto/off something when I really didn't intend to do that.  For me, jumping and climbing is really difficult at times and find that I really miss the smoothness and ease of jumping and climbing that Syndicate has.  Granted this game came out before Syndicate, so I am willing to cut it a bit of slack with that but it is nevertheless frustrating at times.

As it is with the AC games, there is plenty to do with side quests and the collecting of things.  It is interesting to explore the varies areas around the islands.  There is a variety of different quests to do throughout but are pretty similar to what has been done before in the previous games so it does lack a bit in original game play.  I do think the ship and ship battles are an interesting new element to the game.

The collecting of the animus items and songs gets a bit repetitive and is probably my least favorite part of the game.  The songs are a bit of a pain to chase down, although you can pretty much stay where the chase starts to get it fairly easily when it returns.  At least the collectable items aren't as hard to find as the glitches in Syndicate.

The Island scenery is well done and detailed considering the game is 4 yrs old now and considering I am comparing it to Syndicate.  The water is especially detailed and nicely done.  The basic gameplay is pretty much the same as Ezio games.  I do like Syndicates fight controls a bit better as it was easier and worked a bit more smoothly.  I do think that this games missions are more challenging here in Black Flag than Syndicate though as I thought Syndicate's missions were pretty easy to complete.

I am not big fan of multiplayer but this does have an ok MP feature.

I have enjoyed playing the game though, but like with all the AC games, I do have some complaints.  As with the previous AC games, there is still issues with glitchy camera views at times that make it hard to see and do things, such as the scenery blocking your view in the middle of a fight as well as some random game crashes.  A minor gripe is that you cannot put the PS4 in rest mode without quitting the game.  The game button interaction is a bit finicky at times as well.  As with most Ubi games, I am also not a fan of the microtransactions to get extra stuff concept but luckily you can avoid that and still build your character without paying extra to do so.  I do think there is a lot of the sameness in the missions as previous games though and that is a bit of a bummer. I am not so crazy about the Animus office scenes and collecting of notes as it is a bit boring and seems a bit unnecessary to the game. I also think the game menus could be a little less clunky but that could be because I got use to the way Syndicates menus were done.

The story is pretty good though with a likeable character.  The ship battles are a neat addition, but I do think the ship controls are a bit clunky and make the battles a bit harder to manipulate than they should be.  There are plenty of things to keep you busy, although the missions can get a bit repetitive.

I am coming late to this game and got it for less than 20 bucks, but I still find it is fun enough and worth playing, especially if you are a fan of the series.

Sure there was allot of bugs in the game upon release but with all EA releases they are all release unfinished and really buggy. I never buy anything from EA upon release and wait many months until all of the patches come out to fix the game. With that being said here are my thoughts.

Pros.
1. The story, bioware is all about making games with a great story and this game holds to that truth. All of the characters have a back story and it adds to the immersion of the game.

2. The controls are very fluid, with the characters only. They perform well in combat.

3. the quests are fun.

4. The game is long assuming you do all of the quests.

5. The game itself is very fun, if you are into role playing games this is right up your ally.

1. The character models are not very well done. Even though the environment is very beautiful the character models do not look very good texturally. The did fix the eyes but they don't realistic with todays AAA game releases.

2. I absolutely abhor driving the ATI. It does not handle very well and it makes traversing landscapes a royal pain.

3. there are still some bugs in the game they have no intension of fixing. There are some missing audio responses. Some of the NPC will move away from you when talking which causes a temporary freeze.

In short I really enjoyed this game. Despite some of the cons in the game I like this game and I hope they make a new mass effect game. If you like RPGs give it a try you won't be disappointed.",want take time review game mani bad review tube internet would put lot potenti player tri sure allot bug game upon releas ea releas releas unfinish realli buggi never buy anyth ea upon releas wait mani month patch come fix game said thought pro 1 stori biowar make game great stori game hold truth charact back stori add immers game 2 control fluid charact perform well combat 3 quest fun 4 game long assum quest 5 game fun role play game right alli con 1 charact model well done even though environ beauti charact model look good textur fix eye dont realist today aaa game releas 2 absolut abhor drive ati handl well make travers landscap royal pain 3 still bug game intens fix miss audio respons npc move away talk caus temporari freez short realli enjoy game despit con game like game hope,1509753600,5

49686,8957,3694,"There are many things about this game that are awesome. There also many things about this game that make it very annoying. One of which is that it freezes constantly. I just barely got a brand new Xbox one s, and the game still freezes! Poorly made.
Pros:
- Enormous amount of vehicles to choose from.
- Great graphics
- Giant map
- Fun overall game

Cons:
- Difficult to earn money. Buying the VIP pass with real money helps, but it still takes forever to save up for some cars. Not including wheelspins, you earn no more than $20k in most races, and most of the top cars in the game are around 2 mil or more.
- Wheel spins are a good idea, but more often than any other amount you get $10k and under.
- Cars always pop up right on a turns blind spot, which makes you crash often.
- Almost all of the AWD cars are terrible at handling on and off the roads.
- Most cars that aren't AWD have bad acceleration.
- If any cars hit you, you lose all of your skill points.
- Other cars will randomly drive down the wrong side of the road and crash into you.
- Off roading is mostly a complete joke. You are constantly over correcting and just fighting to keep your car straight, while the AI drives perfectly.
- Has glitches that allow people do go insane speeds in garbage cars, which makes it unenjoyable to try and climb the leaderboards driving the normal way.
- While graphics are incredible, the graphics on the vinyls you can use are blocky and pixelated.

49689,7274,4480,"We had this on pre-order for 2 years. Forza 5 was already out. Since then Forza 6 an 7 came out. What we got was nice visuals,and massive chaos in racing achievements in you as driver versus game challenges. Game is structured around expensive steering wheel controllers. When doing the challenges the car is controlled by the game to a release point. When the car is released so you can now control it,the car is pointed in a negative direction that cost you time in correcting,the screen is full of graphics that block your view of the track,and your supposed to beat a perfect challenge in a time based win time of bronze,silver,and gold. Only after much time with the PS4 controller will you finally achieve a gold. Most of all achievements are earned this way. ""NOT"" much racing happening. Your rank earns what tracks you race on. The game can't tell what cars you already have,so expect to get very dissatisfied with many repeats of awarded cars. Even pre-ordering bonus cars,are duplicated by regular(as if you didn't pre-order) cars. Forza never duplicates any cars in your garage!

49731,8247,2667,"Saints Row 4 is a perfect example of a fan service game but yet knows to add enough to make it feel like its own product.

I prefer the crazy out-look that Saints Row has gained ever since the more wacky sides of Saints Row 3. So when the fourth title was announced I was excited to find out that it involved aliens and even a part of being the president. The story really tells the last adventure for the time being of the boss from the last 3 games and in a way brings it to an end with style.

The music was all over the place at times I found it hilarious and fit the mood. At other times it felt out of place while the radio music just goes to waste since you won't be spending much time in the cars.

The game looks just like saints row 3, not really adding anything new other than the way the city is formed but other than that it's still the same engine, the same world which does look really well produced on the ps4.

There isn't much to do after completing the game other than collect these fragments left around town unlocking more abilities or just to complete the collection.

Fast and powerful. Throughout the whole game, you will have this insane power inside of you, at times you will be tempted to go full power but if you do then the game feels cheap and that you're way overpowered. there are several abilities in this game ranging from running very fast to gliding across town or even super strength. In many ways, this is the flash game of the dc universe, which means cars go to waste and are actually a hindrance to finishing the game slowing you down which is a shame since it looks like whoever developed that section ended up going to waste,

The worst part of this game that actually brought it down a star is the expansion pack its one of the worst I've played in years. Its a joy to play as Kinzie or gat but its a damn shame about the plot and even the musical numbers. Even the gameplay feels off.

Saints Row 4 is a fun game with many things to love about it but has its flaws. No new additions to the graphics or world and ignores the car development section with its super speed powers from the start of the game. The worst offender is the DLC which I wouldn't recommend but does bring an interesting idea with its ending ill leave it at that if you wanna play through it.",saint row 4 perfect exampl fan servic game yet know add enough make feel like product prefer crazi outlook saint row gain ever sinc wacki side saint row 3 fourth titl announc excit find involv alien even part presid stori realli tell last adventur time bos last 3 game way bring end style music place time found hilari fit mood time felt place radio music goe wast sinc wont spend much time car game look like saint row 3 realli ad anyth new way citi form still engin world look realli well produc ps4 isnt much complet game collect fragment left around town unlock abil complet collect fast power throughout whole game insan power insid time tempt go full power game feel cheap your way overpow sever abil game rang run fast glide across town even super strength mani way flash game dc univers mean car go wast actual hindranc finish game slow,1509840000,3

49776,3773,75,"In 2018, this is still one of the best gaming mice you can buy. It has amazing build quality, an amazing sensor, and amazing buttons.

Going over the design, its a right handed mouse that is trying to be like the classic MX518 with a twist, and it does a good job at that. Depending on your hand size, it works with any grip style. It has that ""gamery"" look while at the same time looks professional and minimalistic.  Not many companies can make a product like that. Design gets an A+.

Now for features, this mouse packs a punch. Here are the features you get with this mouse:

Well tension-ed button, easy to click but not too easy to click accidentally.  RGB lighting, you can change the color of the Logitech Logo and DPI lighting, unfortunately these are only single zone, so if you change the color of the logo, you also change the color of the DPI lighting.

Pixart PMW3366 Sensor, this sensor was introduced in 2014 with the Proteus Core, and is still one of the best sensors on the market to this day. It can track pixel to pixel movements, it also won't lose track at ANY DPI level, and it can track up to 12,000 DPI.

Weight tuning, this mouse is around 120 grams without any of the weights, so it is rather heavy, while some will appreciate a heavy mouse this may be a deal breaker for others.

Free spinning scroll wheel, this mouse has a wheel like some of the performance mice. Push a button and you unlock free scroll, which is great for navigating long documents or just having fun, haha. It also tilts left and right, which can be re-programmed.

There's many more features with this mouse as well, it sure packs a punch!

The lighting is very minimal. You can change the color of the Logitech Logo and the DPI lighting, with 16.8 million color options to choose from. Unfortunately, these lights are under 1 zone, so you everything has to be the same color. However, this isn't much of an issue considering the lighting is already very minimal, which isn't a bad thing. You do also have 3 lighting effects: Breating, Fixed Color or Color Cycle. Overall, lighting gets an A+.

Now, lets talk about the sensor. The sensor is the PMW3366, which is a modified 3360. And this is arguably one of the best sensors on the market. It doesn't lose track when you flick it as fast as you can, at any DPI level. It tracks pixel to pixel movements at high and low DPI, and is capable of tracking at 12,000 DPI. If you have sensor issues, you either need to calibrate your mouse pad or your product is defective. Sensor gets an A+.

Now, the software. This mouse is powered by the Logitech Gaming Software. The UI is friendly and the program is very stable, its like Synapse 2.0 and Corsair CUE came together. In the software you can program the buttons, change profiles, change the lighting and much much more! You can also sync the lighting with other Logitech RGB products, which is a nice touch. The best part is, once you have setup your mouse the way you want it, you can uninstall the software because this mouse has onboard memory to keep your settings!

This mouse isn't just good for gaming, its great for productivity. I really enjoy using this mouse for things like media creation and general productivity. Its ergonomic, it tracks amazing, and it overall just works.

Would I recommend this? Absolutely! The weight might be a let down for some, but if you don't care about the weight,  this mouse is amazing!",2018 still one best game mouse buy amaz build qualiti amaz sensor amaz button go design right hand mous tri like classic mx518 twist good job depend hand size work grip style gameri look time look profession minimalist mani compani make product like design get featur mous pack punch featur get mous well tension button easi click easi click accident rgb light chang color logitech logo dpi light unfortun singl zone chang color logo also chang color dpi light pixart pmw3366 sensor sensor introduc 2014 proteu core still one best sensor market day track pixel pixel movement also wont lose track dpi level track 12000 dpi weight tune mous around 120 gram without weight rather heavi appreci heavi mous may deal breaker other free spin scroll wheel mous wheel like perform mouse push button unlock free scroll great navig long document fun haha also tilt left right reprogram there mani featur mous well sure,1509840000,5

49818,8319,4214,"I play a lot of Pokemon Go, and this tool helps for certain tasks.

***This tool is NOT good for everything, despite what you may hear.***
Short answer: This is best used for gaining stardust, filling your bag, gaining exp, common Pokemon candy, and hatching eggs.

Pros:
1) It is great to use this while at work, school, etc. and other times you would not normally be playing. You will return to the app to see your eggs are hatched and you have much more stardust and exp.
2) The gps on this is MUCH better on the app, I hatch eggs within ~1km of their actual read distance, unlike the crappy app which can take almost TWICE the distance you walk for it to record that distance walked.
3) The battery lasts about a month of very heavy use, which to me is fine.
Cons:
1) The Pokemon Go Plus is TERRIBLE for catching high level Pokemon, the algorithm per catch is the same as one non curved, non special (nice, great, excellent), regular Poke Ball. My average chance to catch Pokemon with this is ~50%. You will mist most, if not all rare and strong Pokemon with this tool.
2) The catching system is one chance only, if the catch fails the first time, the Pokemon will flee.
3) It will only use Poke Balls, not sure if this is to balance or just a technical thing, but it still is annoying.

So before you pay ~35 USD for this, just think if you actually play this game enough, and know what it is good and not good at.
The Pokemon Go Plus is for Veteran/Hardcore players who have most Pokemon and just want the grind to be easier.
It is NOT for completing the Pokedex.
It is NOT for catching 100% IV or rare Pokemon.

I just got it today, so I really can't say much about the longevity yet.  I love the keys.  I love that I can bottom them out for that tactile bump that I love with mechanical keys.  I love that I can quickly tap them, without bottoming them out, and still have them respond.  I like the all black look much better than than the brush aluminum look that my last keyboard had, it goes with my accesories better.  The lighting is really bright, even on it's lowest setting.  I actually like that though some might find it distracting, especially if reflects off their TV scree.  Think the light bar on a PS4 controller buy with a lot more lights and a lot brighter.  I really like the font use for the letters on the keys, but even if I didn't I could simply replace them with the keys off my broken K90 or buy new ones.  I am not a fan of the textured keys that came with it.  The texture is nice, it's the color and the varrying angles on them.  I guess if you're using your keyboard for gaming and very little of everything else then you it'd be cool, otherwise it's distracting.  I am happy that it doesn't have the G keys.  I never used them, so they just made my keyboard extra wide.  I have the Logitech G600 and all the macros I use are on it.  When gaming my left hand never leaves WASD + Spacebar, even when playing an MMO.

49831,914,4482,"You know, Risen 1 and 2 in particular are games Piranha Bytes released previously that I was quite fond of. Fairly expansive open world games with fun stories and gameplay. Almost insanely difficult gameplay at the beginning, fairly balanced about a third of the way through, and over powered for the back third. I find Piranha Bytes as a whole to be very interesting. In my opinion, they invest a lot of time into their open world design and story, but don't have the technical prowess of a Guerilla Games, CDPR, or even BethSoft, but what Piranha Bytes does possess is a fearless attitude and an ability to craft an excellent open world game without the AAA budgets.

Such is the way of things with Elex. Elex is an excellent open world western RPG with a very cool story and an expansive world complete with a fairly unique and quite interesting take on the post apocalypse. Of course, Elex isn't without its flaws as well. With all that said, lets dive into the actual review.

Story

Elex is set on an alternate Earth with a society that was a bit more advanced than we are now in real life. Maybe leap forward about twenty to thirty years and I think that is where its civilization was technologically. A comet crashes into the planet causing mass devastation and near extinction of humanity and most other things as well.

Of course, not everything died and little by little, humans starting coming out of wherever they had hunkered down to explore and re-settle their world. Aside from global devastation, the comet also brought with it a substance called Elex. It is a crystalline substance that begins to grow throughout the world in clusters that can be mined and traded or even consumed. The over consumption of Elex led to mutations amongst both humans and animals.

Humanity itself broke into four factions (or tribes if you will).

Berserkers have forsworn the consumption of Elex and the use of what is now ancient technology from before the comet struck, preferring instead to use magic which is powered by the consumption of mana, which is Elex converted into a safe and powerful form. Berserkers further have set upon themselves the goal of healing the world via planting World Trees, which convert Elex into Mana and then slowly allow the Mana to seep back into the Earth, healing that part of the world and allowing for plant and animal life to thrive again.

Clerics try to find, examine, document, and use the old technology and incorporate it incorporate it into daily life, from sentinel robots to jetpacks to laser and plasma weapons, and beyond. They think they can unify the world via the study of the past and both implementation and improvement and old technology. They also aren't opposed to consuming Elex, and in doing so, they actually created The Albs (who are the major antagonist throughout the game), who consume Elex to the point of losing all emotion and gaining enhanced strength, intellect, and reflexes.

The Outlaws are basically that. People living outside the other three existing governments, preferring to be free to do whatever. They live as scrap collectors, bandits, messengers, chem dealers, prostitutes, and so on. They gather in a town ruled by a Duke and his District Overseers. As they tend towards criminal activities, they aren't looked upon favorably by the other factions.

You, Jax, play a fallen Alb commander who, through the events that unfold at the beginning of the game, has his system purged of Elex which allows him to actually have feelings and emotions again. As Jax investigates the betrayal that led to his current state of affairs, he also tries to prepare all the other factions of Free People to fight The Albs before the Albs overrun the world in their quest to possess ALL Elex while also destroying the free people as well.

I won't go into anything else story related, but I will tell you that the story was engaging and had some cool twists and turns. While I wouldnt call the actual writing superior, I would say that it was a strong effort with an excellent result.

8.5 out of 10

Gameplay

Gameplay in Elex is probably both its strongest and weakest aspect.

The combat in Elex is basically an upgraded version of what you may have experienced playing the Risen series. At first, it is brutal. You are under-powered and really have to plan each battle ahead of time. You will die often. Fortunately, there are four auto-save slots and any number of manual save slots. I would say it will take most people no less than ten hours to get enough experience and cash together for training and better weapons. each weapon has minimum specs to be able to use them and a lot take a bit of time to level up enough to do so. The wait is worth it though as it really teaches you how to use other things such as your awesome jet pack and the actual terrain itself to give you an advantage.

I personally enjoyed the actual combat. I thought the gunplay was pretty spot on and I played a more stealthy sniper-y character most of the way through my own playthrough. However, once I could start wielding some of the better swords in the game, especially the Legendary weapons, then melee also became quite a bit of fun.

However, its also a bit clunky. Sometimes in melee, you will press the quick attack and it will attack twice instead of once. The same thing happens with power attacks from time to time. Also, your stamina drops pretty quickly, which affects both attacks and dodging. I never really got the hang of parrying, so that isn't something I can really speak to, but with your base stamina, you get like four or five dodges/attacks in sequence before you run out of stamina and cant do anything. That said, once you get used to this, it becomes easier to deal with, and selective use of asymmetrical combat via use of your jet pack always gives you a chance to reassess for a moment. Well, most of the time anyway.

Enemies are pretty efficient. They are excellent aims without a doubt. Solid use of strafing and rolling will minimize this however. All in all, that ends up being a nice system of checks and balances.

There is also no shame in running away. However, you will also need to be crafty in doing so as most enemies will chase you as far as they possibly can. Interestingly enough, random enemies that aren't the same faction or type of creature will fight each other as well and you can and definitely should use this to your advantage by having enemies chase you into other enemies and then getting out of the chaos via your jet-pack.

The world itself is a vast and seamless open world with a ton of exploration available. You will find fast travel spots around the world. Once youve found it, its unlocked for the rest of the game. They are all over the world but still force you to actually have to travel the land on foot at least a little as well, which is cool as you will encounter a lot of interesting stuff along almost any journey you might take.

There are well over three hundred missions in this game, be they main quest stuff, faction quests, or just simple side quests. I found the quest system to be pretty cool and each felt relevant in some way. I probably wandered about the world for a solid sixty hours exploring, completing quests, and leveling up before I really did much in the way of the actual main quest lines. By the end of my playthrough, I was at about a hundred and ten hours. The quests were a high point of the game for me in most instances. When they didn't serve the actual plot progression, they served to really flesh out the world.

Elex is not without issues however. In fact, I would say this is also typical of Piranha Bytes. Youll get the occasional screen tearing and lag. You will fall through the world from time to time. The game will crash from time to time. Clipping becomes a reality, especially with enemies, who often become entangled on their surroundings. This however can be useful, especially while you are under-powered lol.

There is an unnecessary amount of lag when going from the world to your menu, which you will have to do often to reference your map, quest log, equipment, stats, etchonestly, for all the other expected issues the game ended up having, this was one that was unexpected and pretty annoying. Having to wait twenty seconds every time you change interface is aggravating.

There is so much more to this game in a positive sense though, from the crafting to the relationship building and especially the henchmen who you  can take with you on your journey (one at a time), that I could go on for a long time still. Ultimately, the fun factor is always present, and despite its many flaws, Elex is hella fun from a gameplay perspective. Especially once you can use the Legendary equipment. At that point, you're pretty much the boss and it really feels well earned and well deserved to suddenly be a bit over powered after having really ground through some tough times to get there.

Graphics

The graphics in Elex are like the gameplay: both good and bad. The good outweighs the bad however. The game, in most circumstances, is a stunner. The world is vibrant, varied, and interesting. The character designs looked pretty cool. Combat effects looked great. Some of the points of interest in the game were nothing short of stunning. The cut scenes looked nice. However, and especially with the human character models, they were quite limited. There might be thirty or so different facial/character models and such being used, which given how vast the world is and how many people are in it, ends up becoming a bit comical, as everybody basically looks like one of a handful of variations. Of course, they could all just be related to one another I suppose.

All told, I think 7.5 out of 10 is fair for this category

Audio

The audio in Elex is mostly stellar. The music was very cool and there were a number of tracks available for use. The ambient sounds and sounds of battle likewise sounded cool.

The voice acting itself, which is prevalent in the game to Piranha Bytes credit, with every named character being voiced, and there being well over a hundred named characters in the game. The actual voice acting was about the equivalent of my expectation from a good B movie. Some really believable moments mixed in with some wood and some ham.

8 out of 10

Verdict

Elex is not without its issues. In fact, it is plagued with the same issues that show up in every Piranha Bytes game. However, they are less damning than they were in previous games and the fun factor itself just completely makes up for the games shortcomings and really makes Elex shine as an example of how to take less of a budget and still make a huge and impressive, well thought out game that carries the fun well into the hundredth hour.

In fact, there are a lot of story arcs that are triggered by your actions, and you could legitimately get no less than four distinctly different playthroughs with what I imagine to be no less than four different endings as well. I personally ended the game as a Berserker with Separatist Albs and some Clerics as allies in final push against the Albs. However, you can play as any of the four factions or never even bother aligning with one. The options are probably not limitless, but seem like they are.

Ultimately, this ends up being 8.1 bits of Elex turned to mana while the remainder get used as the worlds currency, out of 10 possible.",know risen 1 2 particular game piranha byte releas previous quit fond fairli expans open world game fun stori gameplay almost insan difficult gameplay begin fairli balanc third way power back third find piranha byte whole interest opinion invest lot time open world design stori dont technic prowess guerilla game cdpr even bethsoft piranha byte posse fearless attitud abil craft excel open world game without aaa budget way thing elex elex excel open world western rpg cool stori expans world complet fairli uniqu quit interest take post apocalyps cours elex isnt without flaw well said let dive actual review stori elex set altern earth societi bit advanc real life mayb leap forward twenti thirti year think civil technolog comet crash planet caus mass devast near extinct human thing well cours everyth die littl littl human start come wherev hunker explor resettl world asid global devast comet also brought substanc call elex crystallin substanc begin grow throughout world cluster mine trade even consum,1509926400,4

What the characters say is funny, the different modes allow you to have fun in different ways and two player mode is crazy, where you can steal passengers fro the other players. Still, I don't love the main one player mode because it feels too individual and not like you are really accomplishing anything since you have to choose a new character and car again after the end of every one. It won't keep you busy for weeks at a tie, but it is okay to goof off with when you don't want to get involved with something that takes more time and effort.

49836,2580,4489,"Overall, I really enjoy the look and feel of this new Xbox. I've always been a big gamer and I enjoy titles on Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo. I already had a 4K TV so that wasn't a problem for me. But if you don't have a 4K TV, it's probably a good idea to wait. Now for a pros and cons list!

The pros - most powerful console hardware currently available, lots of games have been given the ""enhanced"" treatment and they do look and play better, Scorpio edition looks really nice, it's surprisingly small and easy to install, very quiet when on, clearly a lot of love and effort went into making this product and the enhanced games show that off.

The cons - it's expensive and is not for everyone. Kind of like the Elite controller, nice to have but not for everyone. The hard drive is 1 TB, which is better than 500 GB but should definitely have been at least 2 TB because the 4K game sizes are very large. Halo and Gears are both around 100 GB. So you'll need an external hard drive at some point.

So if you love Xbox or if you love having the latest and greatest hardware, then consider getting the One X. If you don't, then maybe pass on this for now. But it's a great product. It's received great reviews and support.

49867,4453,4478,"While 'The Fractured but Whole' has turn based, RPG elements to it, it's important to be realistic in expectation to enjoy it. First and foremost, it's intended as humorous versus hardcore. Yes, you can legitimately build your character's attributes, customize fighting styles, and execute grid-based, cooperative battles. But these experiences can feel shallow to veterans of this game genre. At the end of the day - the trademark South Park humor is what drives it.

As a casual fan of South Park, even I was left in stitches the entire time. Sure, there's oodles of inside jokes devotees of the series will find second nature, but these aren't required to appreciate the twisted comedy and hysterical antics and dialogs. Simple tasks of searching through contents of open drawers, farting on random strangers, and customizing character appearance is of the laugh out loud variety.

The star of this show is literally poop. Every bathroom is a chance to shine, with ridiculous ways to excel at the bowel movement experience. Sooner rather than later, one can't help but rhythmically turn analog sticks, and press buttons in sync to toilet movements. Combined with Mr. Towelie's not so subtle drug references, this is definitely NOT a title for little kids.

While clever, The Fractured but Whole can get monotonous. The fighting engine works well, but battles still seem a bit loosey-goosey in execution. Also, roaming houses generates laughs but also monotony after the 10th time. Environments are South Park perfect but also flat (as they should be). Thus, wandering doesn't invoke excitement rather wait for the next great one liner. And the missions can be stupid...to a fault.

I will, however, hand it it the developers: attention to detail is incredible. Every character interaction, attempt to wander off map, and/or story decision will invoke a clever response. Nothing feels forced, instead, a terrific comedy act that rolls laughs into each other. Also - as stated above - fans of the series will be celebrating the pixel and dialog perfect representations of the show's stars.

As someone who missed the first title (which, by the way, is included as a free download with this one) and only a casual fan of South Park, I was very cleverly surprised how much I like this. Time flies while playing it, and it's a welcome respite from more cookie cutter titles and steadfast genres.

Meanwhile, the enemies fight with the same system, having set actions already dictated for them by the game and then adhering by the turn-based system.  Well, not anymore.  Introducing: gambits.  Gambits are a set sequence of actions, dictated by a condition in battle, for each playable character in your party.  It's simply based on a ""if this, then that"" action.  If the party leader attacks something, you cast thundaga.  Or attack.  Or give it a high-five.  Or whatever your gambit dictates.  The high five is a joke, I hope you realize.  Either way, each characters has their own gambits pre-decided by you which basically takes your thumbs away from doing any hard work in battle if your gambits are set up properly.  I've sat around during battles, texting my friends because there's hardly a need to intervene once you have enough gambit slots and options.

Also, introducing, sort of, the License board.  Similar to FFX's sphere grid, only this looks like the periodic table of abilities.  Each character starts off in a different place, but it's a hell of a lot easier to gain abilities than in the sphere grid.  It takes only to about level 70 (which is completely unnecessary) to get all the licenses for all the characters.  A license allows a character to learn an ability, but you have to buy those abilities, and gambits, mind you, at shops.  And, get this, gil (money) is kind of hard to come by.  Stupid me saved every bit of loot from my battles for about three hours before realizing it's useless and I should sell it.  Voila! Gil!

As for the story, it's decent.  At first I was confused and bewildered as it is a highly political game as opposed to our traditional big-baddie who wants to destroy the world and our team is the only one's who can stop him/her/it.  This time, it's about sovereignty mixed with a sort-of-big-baddie.  But the politicalness of the story is tough to follow at first, and I found it hard to care.  Rabanastre, the main city from which everything else branches out from has come under the political rule of Archades, a highly militant city to the north.  Royalty have died or gone into hiding, and the original idea is to just overthrow these monarchs and reestablish free rule to Rabanastre.  You start off playing as an orphan, Vaan, who really doesn't become anything but a compatriot to the more important Lady Ashe, which is a nice change of pace, a female hero for FF games.  Vaan lives in Rabanstre, it's his home, and he's rightly bitter at the monarchs considering his brother, who was a soldier, died in the war as did his parents.  However, life seems pretty peachy in Rabanastre.  Freedom has been stolen, however, and it must be gotten back.  Okay, fine.  You can feel my indifference, I'm sure.  Thankfully, the story becomes a little bit more dire and urgent with the talk of more magical issues like manufacted (yes, I spelled it correctly) nethecite (may not have spelled that one correctly).

These stones, manufacted nethecite, magicite, somethingcite are powerful stones of magic that can bring about great destruction and ultimate power for those who wield it.  Obviously Archades has a lot of this power and a lot of these stones.  The plot thickens, thank goodness.  And so Vaan, his friend Penelo, Lady Ashe, a sky pirate named Baltheir, his counterpart bad-ass bunny partner and eye candy Fran, and a forlorn soldier Basch who was wrongfully imprisoned for years, but recovers quite quickly upon joining the party, must battle Archades and their power hungry appetite to free their homes and bring peace to the land.

Everything else basically remains the same.  There are summons (called espers) to be gained, and limit breaks called quickenings that are both based off of MP (magic point) amounts which, at first, I hated.  Once you're past level 30'ish and you get a few very nifty licenses, you'll be fine with it, most likely, as I was.  There are optional bosses, side quests that add to the story, and fun little games to play throughout the world.  My only qualm is you don't get a hold of ""free"" travel until fairly late in the game.  As these worlds are usually quite expansive, an airship or boat or something is usually provided after a few levels to help you get around.  There are things called Teleport Stones that are rare that help, but you can't go off and do a lot of side questing until much later in the game 'cause you'll use all of them up and have to hoof it everywhere.  Later, much, much, later you get a ship, but damn it takes forever.

A new idea introduced in the game replaces the card games and sports games of old.  Hunts.  Basically, you're a monster hunter.  You go after these monsters that are usually plaguing an area once you speak to the petitioner of the hunt, kill it, return to the petitioner and get some nifty rewards.  All well and good as these are some of the most challenging battles in the game.  Some of them are very hard to locate and are tied to, of course, other side quests, but are worth it.  Speaking of monsters!  The variety sucks in this game, unfortunately.  We just battled a big horse thing with spikes on its head, cool!! Five levels later... ohh look another horse thing but this guy doesn't have spikes but has the same body type... Ten levels later... another horse thing...bigger...great..but it's green this time.  It's like the game developers just replaced generalized body types and different colors for the monsters and called them new.  I guess it looks like it's a more traditional way of looking at evolution, since most creatures DO look the same in reality.  But come on, guys.  We're not in reality.  We're in a Final FANTASY game.  Make the creatures different, please!  At least for visualization's sake.

All in all, I liked it.  I'll stress the word ""like."" It took a while to grow on me, but I don't feel like I wasted 100 hours of my life on something lame and dreary.  It was decent.  And thankfully, the need to get to level 99 isn't pressing.  70, I mentioned earlier, was way more than adequate.",might well start fight someth ff game still common crap ton fight necessari level get stronger fight unbeliev difficult bos although begin end strictli turnbas fight actual allow game grow tradit ff game turn base put command individu parti act turn come around meanwhil enemi fight system set action alreadi dictat game adher turnbas system well anymor introduc gambit gambit set sequenc action dictat condit battl playabl charact parti simpli base action parti leader attack someth cast thundaga attack give highfiv whatev gambit dictat high five joke hope realiz either way charact gambit predecid basic take thumb away hard work battl gambit set properli ive sat around battl text friend there hardli need interven enough gambit slot option also introduc sort licens board similar ffx sphere grid look like period tabl abil charact start differ place hell lot easier gain abil sphere grid take level 70 complet unnecessari get licens charact licens allow,1510012800,4

Buying the Xbox one X Project Scorpio Edition, had to have been the most exciting part of my gamin life. Finally True 4K on a 75in X900E From Sony. Unboxed both system and tv. Wallah! The Xbox One X system couldn't run any game smoothly at all. I thought maybe tv, maybe internet, maybe system, God hope not!. Sent the system in for repair. All good on microsofts end and two weeks down the road, got my system, plugged it in, STILL SAME ISSUE!!!!! So I tried switching the tv. Next was LG oled E7P, then B7A, Then Q7F from Samsung. The Q7F seemed to be the best, but not the best performance of the system. So I sent my system back to amazon and went to order a new system. Oh goody the Xbox one X Project Scorpio Edition went up 125 more dollars. Screw it. I am going with the original system. Got it finally and guess what. SAME GOD UGH PROBLEM!!!!! Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for hyping up this console. It really pisses me off for the time, money, and everything to have a non working console for a second time in a row. Bought a PS4 pro today just to see how it preformed with the tv. Flawless. So Guess the system was the real problem here, and cannot for the life of me figure out how people are running this system so smoothly. Bare in mind I did all the settings. Look elsewhere and do not follow the 5/5 ratings.

How in the world did this get 5/5? I have a Xbox one x, PS4 pro, and Custom pc. Own all 3 Assassins Creed Origins on all systems. Have had to go through a Sony x900e, Lg oled B7A,E7P and multiple repairs for my one x. Could not for the love of me get this game to run smoothly. It is janky, jittery, and lags terribly. I have done all the updates, system reboots, tv everything and this game is a mess on my one x. I just got a PS4 pro and Samsung q7f today and the PS4 pro runs as smooth as butter. The pc version as well. But the Xbox doesnt want to cooperate. Expected better..... OLD REVIEW. The Xbox One X, Project Scorpio Edition, is a once in a lifetime beauty to behold. Hello Everyone, Welcome to Citrus County Reviews. XBOX Scorpio Edition has to have been the promise that was lived up to be. It delivers true 4k, her, and amazing quality to overall titles and future games to come. Upon unboxing I noticed a sort of heaftiness which is great due to it's a durable, premium console. The system did get hot at times, but not overbearing or extreme temperatures. I didn't notice any red rings or any sort of shutdown, but I had noticed a couple times when redeeming a code, the controller seemed to not register a letter, but this was a rare occurrence. The external look of the system is downright beautiful. Hard to say that with a black console, since that is the norm nowadays, but something about the glossy finish, the etched lettering of Project Scorpio, I feel just honored having this bestowed on my gaming display. One complaint is the internal storage capacity. 1TB is all you get here and strongly recommend an external 2TB all the way to 8TB from Seagate. I noticed the 1TB internal went away so fast after installing Assassins Creed, Shadow of War, Forza 7, and of course Call Of Duty WW2, I had like 92% Used space with 8% left. The 8TB though I have 7.9 TBS left. It is recommended if you have a lot of game digital and physical. Now for the 4K aspect. You need to go to your local Best Buy and find what TV best suites your eyes. Each person is different in how their eyes see pictures and movement speeds. I found 2 TVS that will match the XBOX one X perfectly. The Q7F from Samsung and if course, the high and mighty OLED55E7P, or OLED55B7A from LG. Qled technology is kind of old nowadays and doesn't suffer from burn in issues like the oleds. The only issue with qled is backlight, lag, and some picture issues. Oled however can and probably us the best way for you to go. Even if Microsoft partnered with Samsung for Qled, that doesn't make it the best TV for the Xbox one X. The LG models range in price with the E7P having an all glass screen and Dolby Atmos speakers built right in, to the B7A with a plastic screen and no Dolby Speaker. The input lag is 21ms which is outstanding for gaming. From what I have heard is that this has HDR10, but your gonna want to check on this. These do however have screen retention and your gonna want to be careful on choosing. No matter what you do end up choosing, you'll be happy with your choice after asking and studying up on it. Word of advice. Wait till January 2018, all 2017 models will have a huge price drop. Don't be like me who just buys a 4K TV on a whim. I went for a MU7000 by Samsung which is 4K, but lacks hdr10 support and other features. Game at times look absolutely incredible, but suffer due to lag city. Your gonna want to look for input lag, hdr10 and 4K support with about 10bit 60-50hz. If you want you can go up to 244hz as well. This is a system worth purchasing, but stay away from the mu7000 from Samsung. It's lag city. Here is a picture as well to show you what it is missing. Hope you enjoyed my honest review of the Xbox One X Project Scorpio Edition.  This indeed was a promise kept from Microsoft, delivered it to many Long Waited Fans, and has proven to not disappoint.

49919,7002,4423,"As a fighting game, it's still good old Tekken, but it really lacks polish everywhere else. Tekken has had some crazy and ridiculously cheesy story modes, but this is by far the worst. Compared to Mortal Kombat X, which had a pretty decent story mode, this is just laughably bad. My girlfriend and I found ourselves laughing a lot, or just flat out skipping cutscenes. At least MKX had you fighting actual characters in the roster, but Tekken has you fighting robots by hand and even with a machine gun, which is just completely stupid and boring. You don't play fighting games for the story, but they deliberately made the story mode which isn't that short by the way, and it's just terrible. It's boring.

49955,8986,4028,"My brother preordered the New 2DS XL black and turquoise edition for me and I bought this case not knowing which one of my DSs I was going to use this Pikachu case for. It wasn't until a few days later when I decided to use this case for the New 2DS XL. Its very fluffy, and I do like it, but 1 problem with the case itself is that it isn't padded very well. So, if you're like me and you DONT put protective covers on your DSs, you could end up damaging or even breaking your system while its in this case if you drop it. I also don't really use the clip that came with the case. I took that off and will use it for something else. I like the fact that the case has 2 separate pockets. 1 for your DS, and 1 for accessories. If you have the DS lite, DSi, original 3DS, or New 3DS (NOT the XL), you can fit it in the back pocket. The XL models won't fit in the back pocket. They can only fit in the front pocket. As for the original 2DS, I don't know if you can fit it in the case at all or not.

49956,7193,4489,"I already own an Xbox One S but since I have a 4k TV I decided to purchase this to be able to take advantge of the 4k. I am a PC gamer and no other console got me excited like this one because now it allows me to play 4k games in my living room instead of in my computer room slouched over.

Pros:
-4k HDR console that is half the price of a high end gaming PC
-UI feels more snappy and responsive
- If the devs support it I can even do 1080p 60fps instead of 4k 30fps depending on the game.
- Small form factor

The only Con I can think of currently is the lack of console exclusives.

- Graphic powerhouse. It really delivers here. Edges are so smooth and textures clear. This is why this was built and it succeeds here.
- System remains pretty quiet despite the additional heat generated. A bit quieter than my PS4 Pro.
- simple yet beautiful design

Cons:
- included hard drive fills fast. I've installed 4 AAA titles and am at 30% filled. I really wish 2tb storage was standard for this model especially considering the 4k texture updates many games are getting. An external is in my future.
- Game installs take a very long time. I've heard this has been a continuous complaint for all Xbox Ones so I guess nothing's changed in that respect. Even with the ""install game then patch"" route, it's still much slower than PS4.

It would have been neat to have the Scorpio Editions individually numbered (as well as the controllers) or have something else come with it besides the stand to give it more of an exclusive feel. Just a thought, not a con.

Despite being an avid gamer, I had never played an MMO before.  But Star Wars games draw me like no other, so I bit the bullet and got my first MMO.  I was not disappointed.  The reason for this is that while this is an MMO, you don't have to play it as one--it can be a pure RPG for a long time.  The core stories for the eight different character classes each take at least 100 hours of play and perhaps upwards of 200.  Now you are going to get diminishing returns after the first two or three play-throughs of different classes, but even for a single play-through alone this game is worth it as an RPG.  Character development, voice acting, setting (back during the time of Knights of the Old Republic games), and plot are all well thought out and well-done.  The cut scenes are pure Star Wars--grand and epic.  The gameplay itself is fun and, I felt, forgiving of a first time MMOer, while still having a number of more traditional RPG elements.  If you are interested in the MMO aspect as a first timer, it is fairly easy to figure out and you can usually find someone helpful who will explain things to you.  That said, my overall impression is that this doesn't have the strongest MMO community compared to some other games, but I don't have enough experience with MMOs to say for sure.

Truly, for the price, this is a great product.  Yes, there is a subscription fee, but for at least a few months to a year of game play it is worth it.

50025,4194,75,"I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good mouse. I purchased this mouse to replace my Logitech G9x (best mouse I have ever owned) for the reason that it seemed to be a good mouse and it was designed after the Logitech G9x. After doing my research and watching multiple un-boxings and reviews by people I have a couple things that I agreed with that were pointed out and some observations of my own.

Pro:
- Feels good to the hand
- All features work well and are easy to access through the Logitech gaming software
- Buttons feel good when pressed
- Long Cord that feels like its going to last

Cons:
- At first the button plastic will feel cheap (its not but it felt that way at first)
- The cord tends to retain its shape better than it should
- The mouse is designed to sit in the palm of your hand, thus if you are someone who do not have the mouse sit in the palm of your hand (like me) it can be harder to reach some of the forward buttons (such as the DPI Up or the DPI Shift)
- DPI seems to be unique to this mouse (Meaning if you match the DPI from your old mouse it will NOT feel the same moving across your screen, just takes a little bit of Adjustment Time)

Although I listed more criticisms of the mouse that I did benefits, I still thinks this mouse is a fantastic mouse. I have been using it over the past couple months and although it is no G9x its the closest I can come to one. I give this mouse a 5 star rating for all of its features that I use and even the ones I don't.",would recommend product anyon look good mous purchas mous replac logitech g9x best mous ever own reason seem good mous design logitech g9x research watch multipl unbox review peopl coupl thing agre point observ pro feel good hand featur work well easi access logitech game softwar button feel good press long cord feel like go last con first button plastic feel cheap felt way first cord tend retain shape better mous design sit palm hand thu someon mous sit palm hand like harder reach forward button dpi dpi shift dpi seem uniqu mous mean match dpi old mous feel move across screen take littl bit adjust time although list critic mous benefit still think mous fantast mous use past coupl month although g9x closest come one give mous 5 star rate featur use even one dont,1510272000,5

50027,7300,1412,"Overall, solid racing setup.  It starts as a good setup that with some modifications and calibrations make it a great setup.  If you're not sure if racing is your thing, get this.  It's one of the cheapest full setups you'll find for the money and won't totally break the bank.  I for one will probably upgrade, but this bridges the gap nicely.

The Wheel - Very good quality materials, paddle shifters responsive and sturdy, decent force feedback.  Since I use this for Project Cars 2, I applied the almost mandatory Jack Spade profile, which made the FF excellent.  Others have stated this saved the game for them.

The pedals - Sturdy, somewhat heavy plastic base, good quality pedals with a good throw... except...the brake pedal.  At first I thought it was broken, but then did some research.  Logitech was trying to emulate a real brake pedal which has more resistance.  I just did a recalibrate on it and it does indeed feel more realistic.  I give light pressure for normal braking, and if I need to slam the brakes and lock up the wheels, I have to put some leg into it.  I like that.  People it's not hard, there is calibration and there are mods.  Luckily, I didn't need to mod it.

Shifter - Not too impressed, however I cannot beat Logitech up too bad, as this only cost 60 bones. It has an okay quality.  It is very loose between the grooves and I frequently miss gears because of this.  There is a relatively cheap mod to fix this as well.  It also does not have a sequential mode like other shifters.  There is a way to make this happen too, but it involves rubber bands and such.

The shape does feel wider than other mice and is comfortable for me. For a lightweight mouse, the construction is good. The gray sides have a good texture and rubberized feel. Unfortunately, button feel is somewhat loose; the left click has a spongy feel sometimes but is OK. The wheel has tactile feedback, low resistance and is solidly mounted.  The sensor is an older red led, but it tracks well and isn't a liability.

When I first tried to order this on a Warehouse Deal, they sent me a Harpoon instead and the buttons are far superior on that mouse (the shape was another story).

50039,8889,708,"I don't understand the low ratings for this game at all.  I have not played online in multiplayer, but I've played on local games and local multiplayer versus AI bots even on veteran difficulty and also playing squads.  One thing that's really important you have to adjust your TV settings. I had enemies blurred into the scenery, the game look washed out on my screen. After using one of those ""best picture calibrations tests"" to adjust brightness, contrast, sharpness, color, tint, etc and then going into the options and adjusting the game settings it was 20 times better.  The AI in other cod titles seems stupid and easy to beat in comparison to ghosts.

These are some of the smartest AI bots I've fought against in a game.  Playing Modern Warfare remastered while a great game your gun choices, perk choices and options are very limited. in ghosts you've got squad vs squad, you can make your own squad and personalize every detail about them (even a bot AI squad) and play against another bot AI squad or take them online and play against other players squads.  Don't play the game until you patch it, its so much better and you get the freefall map.  The MSBS assault rifle is a monster even with a silencer attached and the ARX-160 is so much fun to use. Seems to have almost no recoil its got the laser sight for hip firing.

As for the DLC? choose your DLC carefully, some is worth it, some is not. The standout dlc maps are Bayview, Fog,Ignition,Unearthed, Collision, Departed (for sure maybe even one of the best dlc maps) and subzero can be fun at times. As for worst maps? Goldrush takes the cake on that one. Behemoth is nothing special, and containment is just down right annoying. You have some awful default maps but also some really great ones.  Stormfront is an awesome map with a lot of players the more players the better that map gets.  Warhawk is always a really fun and enjoyable map to play, which I prefer squad vs squad on.

Stonehaven and Prisonbreak they could take out and I'd never miss them cause I never play those two maps.  Picking the right perks and the weapon that feels the best to you is how NOT to get killed.  Essential perks IMO ? Focus is an absolute must, I'd go with Scavenger so you don't run out of ammo, Hardline is great for getting a ton of kills with your killstreaks.  Incog is an underrated gem, especially playing versus the AI. If you don't want to be snuck up on then Amplify is a lifesaver. Keep in mind the AI bots hear everything even from across the map you'd think you were an elephant to them, so dead silence as well.  It's just too bad you can't turn off the dam music, if the could patch that? that would be fantastic.",dont understand low rate game play onlin multiplay ive play local game local multiplay versu ai bot even veteran difficulti also play squad one thing that realli import adjust tv set enemi blur sceneri game look wash screen use one best pictur calibr test adjust bright contrast sharp color tint etc go option adjust game set 20 time better ai cod titl seem stupid easi beat comparison ghost smartest ai bot ive fought game play modern warfar remast great game gun choic perk choic option limit ghost youv got squad v squad make squad person everi detail even bot ai squad play anoth bot ai squad take onlin play player squad dont play game patch much better get freefal map msb assault rifl monster even silenc attach arx160 much fun use seem almost recoil got laser sight hip fire dlc choos dlc care worth standout dlc map bayview fogignitionunearth collis depart sure mayb even one best dlc map subzero fun time worst map goldrush take cake one behemoth noth special contain,1510272000,5

50047,1187,706,"While a lot of gamers have knocked the multiplayer, when it comes to gaming, I'm all about the campaign storyline.  After all that's clearly where most of the development went.  I can't even imagine buying games just to run around anonymously shooting people half a world away on new maps.  Of course, I also can't imagine throwing money away on downloads and streaming either.  So, maybe I'm behind the times.  Or maybe I just value my hard earned dollar to much than to throw it away on something even the Supreme Court has ruled consumers have no legal ownership rights for.  But that's another topic.

Sadly, the campaign is a little TOO sloppy and narrow of focus.  It's been a while since I played a CoD game that felt this confining.  You don't have very far to roam outside the very narrow path the game has predetermined for you to take.  Worse, as soon as you move too far off course a warning counter takes over your screen, sometimes making it impossible to see well enough to find your way back into play in time, like when searching down dark hallways for all the collectibles you're supposed to be looking for.  This was COMPLETELY UNWARRANTED and a MAJOR ANNOYANCE.  But that's hardly the games only failing.  It's frustrating seeing a shot fired without effect on an enemy, simply because the game programmer didn't figure on anyone shooting as far as their scope could actually see, sometimes half as far.  Sometimes bullets have no effect solely because of something like a doorway, even though the enemy can shoot you through walls apparently or is no more than ten feet away.

Then there's the fact that the game gives you about 5 different loadouts to choose from before each level, but doesn't bother to tell you the nature of the mission, so you better know what type of weapon to choose.  And don't get me started on all the side tasks that don't work or aren't explained adequately enough, for you to know what you're supposed to be doing.  One example is on the last level where you've got to kill 20 robots with grenades.  Each time I try, I'll count the kills I know I made and made alone.  I'll have 20 clear, undisputable kills, but the game will only give me credit for 6 max.  I don't know if it's just bugged, like 90% of the games produced today and clearly this one if the frequency of no effect hits is any indication.  Or maybe they meant 20 of one specific, undefined type of robot.  Or maybe they meant 20 with a single grenade?!?  Oh well, I gave up going for that one after about 30 tries.

Modern Warfare was top notch.  But Activision needs to put their A programmers back on the team, if they plan for any more Black Ops games.  This one felt like they blew their budget on actors and didn't take the time to proof their work.  Even loading the game was unreasonably long - virtually an hour just to install from the disc, which it forces the multiplayer install first meaning campaign enthusiasts have to wait even longer.  And it won't install while the system is in standby.",lot gamer knock multiplay come game im campaign storylin that clearli develop went cant even imagin buy game run around anonym shoot peopl half world away new map cours also cant imagin throw money away download stream either mayb im behind time mayb valu hard earn dollar much throw away someth even suprem court rule consum legal ownership right that anoth topic sadli campaign littl sloppi narrow focu sinc play cod game felt confin dont far roam outsid narrow path game predetermin take wors soon move far cours warn counter take screen sometim make imposs see well enough find way back play time like search dark hallway collect your suppos look complet unwarr major annoy that hardli game fail frustrat see shot fire without effect enemi simpli game programm didnt figur anyon shoot far scope could actual see sometim half far sometim bullet effect sole someth like doorway even though enemi shoot wall appar ten foot away there fact game give 5 differ loadout choos level doesnt,1510272000,2

- Sold by: Golden Century Deals

- Amount: $299

- SINGAPORE/MALAYSIA system

- DOES NOT CONTAIN WALLPAPER CODES

- STICKERS COVER THE MALAYSIA REGION CIRCLE

- BOX NOT SHRINK WRAPPED OR MANUFACTURER STICKERED AND COULD EASILY CONTAIN USED SYSTEM

All in all, this is basically the same as a used system to me. I'm not apposed to this, it's just worthless to me as a collector. If I knew that this was not what I wanted I would have just moved along. And yes I know that this can play US games. As I said, the issue isn't me being able to use it. It's that it has questionable (at best) value to me as collector, and if all i wanted it for was to game on, I would have just purchased a used system.

AMAZON: You need to crack down on these sellers and their descriptions. This is clearly not what is advertised. I have had this for exactly 15 minutes and I already have my return shipping label in my email.

Lesson learned. IF YOU DO NOT PREORDER SOMETHING BRAND SPANKING NEW YOU MAY AS WELL WRITE IT OFF. Cause everything past the fact is not only going to be overpriced as all hell, it will be an inferior version (or a ripoff) of what you wanted.

AND FOR REVIEWERS: Please name the actual company you purchased from. Help us screen out the people scamming folks and stick with the ones who actually deliver what we pay for.

EDIT: Cooled off a bit and looked in the box. The box clearly shows it has been opened cause the manufacturers sticker seal is removed and left the telltale surface peel on box. Everything seems to be there and it's in good condition. Pretty much new. But with an already opened box this may as well be a used system so far as I am concerned.

It is worth it to get it if you want the experience but don't expect any meaningful gameplay out of this.

Graphics: 10/10 top notch.

Sound: 8. The voice acting, weapons systems and sounds of the starship ( red alert ) are awesome. No music or soundtrack though or none that I remember.

Single Player:
They have tutorials that teach you different positions in a starship like tactical , engineer, captain , pilot and the controls are convincing. Now when I watch the show it makes sense what mysterious buttons they're pushing to do stuff. What each persons role really does. It's believable once you've been in the chair.

But beyond the superficial appearance you'll begin to see where the game is lacking. The missions boil down to investigating things by scanning them, rescue missions and fighting klingons. That's pretty much it. I mean come on game designers - come up with something more interesting like a story line where you try to solve some mysterious phenomenon by solving some puzzle or the ability to send away teams ( you don't actually have to be in them just do something where the ai will investigate and come back with something and you have options of what to do ) or maybe you are trying to negotiate a peace treaty between two species, or maybe you find a new species and depending on your actions they could become hostile etc.  and how about being able to hail the other ships come on! put more thought into it!!!!

Multiplayer:
Same problem as single player and more - the lack of interesting missions to do I mean beyond the gimmick of commanding and fooling around with starship buttons there really isn't much there. Also equally annoying is that I'll usually get a crew of people that just want to f around and fight Klingons. They don't actually want to act like a bridge crew or do anything they consider boring and there's really nothing you can do that will motivate them to do otherwise. People do what they feel and that's it the captain is actually useless and worthless position besides viewing objectives. Maybe it's okay to play with friends but out there in weirdo land I have yet to land a crew I enjoy playing with- they may be polite but usually they just do whatever the hell they want.

It's really so boring I stopped playing after a few times. I mean c'mon - how about adding true multiplayer where your ship vs another bridge crew??? How about being able to hail other ships and actual ability to interact with things in the universe??? Right now it's just a fancy interface with superficial appearance of progress. What you're really doing is working together to go to point A, do some mundane task, go to point B do some mundane task maybe encounter Klingons do some fighting. That's it - the novelty eventually wears off. It's as fun as working together to screw on a light bulb in Star Fleet uniforms.

50091,9004,2380,"Desktop Intel i7, GTX 970, Windows 10. Reviewer - 59y/o white male. I receive no compensation for my reviews. Genre: FPS, survival horror, gruesome, some foul language. Dying light is very much like Half Life 2 and STALKER with a little Assassins Creed thrown in. If you are old enough to remember the first HalfLife game, the 'Interloper' mission? There's some of that in here too. Must have a STEAM account and open Internet to play. Single player and Multiplayer modes; LAN or Internet. There is a story, but I won't try to summarize that here. I'll just say the story is engaging yet also 'vanilla' in that it takes no chances. It is a open game that lets you explore and linger as long as you wish before moving on. The 'maps' are large enough so that the edges are rarely a problem. You receive assignments/tasks for which you are paid and then you can buy better weapons. However, there's another way to advance. Instead of buying you can search the city for goodies and upgrades; which can be tedious. There are no vehicles and it is first-person only. You start out very weak and vulnerable but upgrades come quickly and soon you feel as if you can defeat any foe. Then, of course, the game gets harder. Your weapons are mostly melee-type, but guns become available later. The best weapon isn't always a gun. The city is Harran, a fictitious place in Iran. The same buildings and interiors are repeated over and over, but there are different parts of the city and some hidden areas to explore. You can swim in and under the water. The zombies you are also repeated. That gets old quickly. Going out at night is very intense, or just 'sleep' through it like in Far Cry 2. Occasionally, you may get stuck at a particularly difficult objective which helps break the monotony. There are a large number of optional tasks and side missions, but eventually you get to move on to ""Sector Zero"" which has the tougher zombies and different architecture. Single player campaign is as long as you want it. There is the ability to continue beyond the final battle and return to any area for more fun. No manual saves; auto saving is good enough. Hordes of zombies, and, as I counted, 3 'boss battles'. I don't do multiplayer. Graphics are good, audio is good, game-play immersive. Overall does a good job if you like 'The Walking Dead' scenario.",desktop intel i7 gtx 970 window 10 review 59yo white male receiv compens review genr fp surviv horror gruesom foul languag die light much like half life 2 stalker littl assassin creed thrown old enough rememb first halflif game interlop mission there must steam account open internet play singl player multiplay mode lan internet stori wont tri summar ill say stori engag yet also vanilla take chanc open game let explor linger long wish move map larg enough edg rare problem receiv assignmentstask paid buy better weapon howev there anoth way advanc instead buy search citi goodi upgrad tediou vehicl firstperson start weak vulner upgrad come quickli soon feel defeat foe cours game get harder weapon mostli meleetyp gun becom avail later best weapon isnt alway gun citi harran fictiti place iran build interior repeat differ part citi hidden area explor swim water zombi also repeat get old quickli go night intens sleep like,1510444800,4

50102,8750,3865,"If you get Battlefield 1 revolution don't buy it used, get it new because you need the redeem codes for dlc, and if they've been redeemed you might as well have just bought the used regular version and bought the expansions separately. There is no point in getting revolutions used.

Now my impressions:
Where to start? I'll say this: I've been a long time battlefield fan since the battlefield 1942 days and I'll tell you why - they are the only game franchise that has accomplished the ability the capture the epic scale of war into an enjoyable first person shooter. Period. No other game company has done this to my knowledge.

Amazing features in a multiplayer game:
To really appreciate what they've done you really have to acknowledge what this game features: 64 players fighting in epic scale well designed maps that are modeled after real battles in World War 1. The gameplay includes usable vehicles - tanks, ships, airships, airplanes, trains, motorcycles - mounted weapons - machine guns, flak guns, cannons, artillery - interactive terrain - destructible houses, towers, mills - you can hide inside them including bunkers, trenches. I mean, - you also get classic yet unique abilities with soldier classes like medic, scout, assault, support with actual roles to play in the game - they all play differently enough and has access to different weapons/equipment. No other game has this level of design and detail.

Single player:
Let's just say this: Battlefield has always been and always was at its heart a massive 64 player multiplayer shooter that favors massive battles over single player campaigns. Nobody really buys battlefield games for single player so if that's what you're looking for this is the wrong game for you as you really do need multiplayer to enjoy this game. With that said, this is my first time seeing a single player campaign in the Battlefield series and I have to say it's not bad at all. The story telling and voice acting is really interesting and it actually prompted me to learn more about WW1. The campaign can get a little repetitive and mundane but it was interesting enough that I never really got bored. You can probably get through the single player campaign in a few days if you play a few hours a day and it really serves as more of a tutorial to get players familiar with the game mechanics and different classes in the game.
  After completing the single player though it really made me appreciate the harshness of World War 1 and the people involved in it. It does try to get you to understand that War is tragic and not try to glorify the hero like in many of the other games. It tells you right off the bat that you are not expected to survive. It really does capture the gruesomeness of war unlike any other game I've played and it's a great thing to see that you don't play some glorified unlikely hero that can somehow kill hundreds of enemy soldiers like in other games. Well at least that's what the game tries to portray but there are typical scenarios where you're expected to wipe out crucial entities in encampments by yourself which can lead to killing entire encampments in one way or another. I think the campaign is great, not the best, but left an impression on me.

Multiplayer:
This is really the meat of the game. You go online and play 32vs32 in massive campaigns where your objective is to capture areas and push the enemy back. The game is well balanced and the game doesn't punish new players by overpowering experienced players that have weapons unlocked. Everyone has an equal chance at killing and you don't need to fight to really win, you just need to capture the objectives.

And this time around there are some interesting game modes besides the usual Conquest mode. I forget all the modes, but particularly interesting is the mode where both sides are just pushing through the middle in an all or nothing battle where you're either defender or attacker and you have limited troops so if too many soldiers die too many times before pushing through that leads to defeat. That is an awesome mode if you want to see big battles in a small area. There is also an operation mode that can be played for hours and what this mode does is it ties one battle to be next where you see how conquering one map leads to the next map in this grand scale nonstop campaign. It's basically the same gameplay but the different levels being that your next fight depends on your previous one and ultimately decides whether your campaign ended in success or defeat depending on the chain of events.

I will have to say though that one disappointment I had with multiplayer was that almost nobody uses voice chat and I was used to being able to type and chat on the pc in the old games - I still can't figure out how to change PS4 party chat back to public squad chat - where the hell is that option?? Now I'm permanently muted because I chose to join PS4 party. This makes you feel like you're on your own even though you are technically a part of a squad in some big battle and that really kills team work. Without teamwork it really diminishes the games true potential to be more strategic based.

Level design:
The maps are all great and well designed. They have choke point s where players are forced into big fights to take the next area. I like all the maps. They are all the right scale and size if you have enough players.

Summary:
This game really is great. I was a battlefield 1942 fan and even more of a fan of their modern war mod set in the gulf war era and was skeptical of how World War 1 would look in a game ( I don't typically like World War 1,2 settings and prefer modern settings ), but it was surprisingly well produced. I was hooked on this game for hours in multiplayer.

The Cut scenes are plentiful and awesome. I love the different characters and how they are unique plot wise, and in their move set lists. I have two big gripes. First, the main character has a tail, and for some reason that freaked me out at first. I got over it the further I got into the game. Second is what I consider a design flaw. Essentially when you reach your equivalent of a limit break, you are forced to use it. This is a small issue in the game, and there are ways in which you can prevent your characters from reaching that status. Additionally you stay in the ""Limit Broke"" Status for several turns, being able to use special techniques during that time. This is definitely my second favorite Final Fantasy, (second to VII), even though I think from a technical perspective, this game is better.

Personally, I have a smaller head and the Siberias are perfectly fine with super comfortable ear pads. I can play for hours with zero discomfort. Sound wise, as many other reviews say the A50s are louder overall. The Siberias I have to use at 70% volume to equal 50% volume on the A50s. That being said I prefer the sound of the Siberias. The standard EQ settings aren't as good as Astros but I made a custom one that sounds incredible in my opinion. Having the swappable batteries means never having to stop and charge my headset again. Currently getting 15-20hrs per charge. The microphone quality is about the same for both headsets so I don't prefer one over the other. The only negative which doesn't bother me is that a chat cable is required for the Siberias to work. Doesn't bother me as I used A50 Generation 1 & 2 models before which both required a chat cable.

50165,5180,4489,"Microsoft has been on a roll lately with pleasing their fans. I think they realize that, with the market share Sony has this console generation, the fans are their greatest asset (in lieu of first party exclusives, of course). Microsoft has always had cool project names for their products (remember Natal, which became Kinect? RIP), and it's great to see them embrace the coolness with this limited release of the new X version of the console. While there isn't a ton of differences between this and the regular One X console, remember that this is just a special edition branding, and you can't expect Microsoft to build a whole different console style for a limited release.

I'm actually pretty impressed with what they did do. The top of the console as well as the underside of the controller have a very sleek and good looking texturing that offsets the plainness of the matte finish on the One X (I prefer the matte after owning an original Xbox One which picked up dust, light scuffs and fingerprints very easily on the glossy plastic finish). The understated ""Xbox green"" printing on the console and the controller looks awesome in person, and is great fan service to the Xbox brand. I also like the monochrome look of the controller - the gray buttons contrast nicely with the green Scorpio lettering. The included stand is substantial and feels quite secure for mounting the console upright.

As for the One X console itself, it's a heavy (very heavy!) and well-made, beautifully designed, piece of technology. Nearly everything you do is benefitted by the enhanced internals, especially the 12GB of super fast RAM. Just like upgrading RAM on a PC is a better overall experience, the same can be said of the Xbox One. I have yet to own a 4K TV, though that is definitely a focus now, but even at 1080 everything looks better, even the dashboard UI. When I first booted the system and began to set it up, there was (of course) a patch to download, but while it downloaded, a message displayed which let me know that I could get a head start on setup by inputting a code into the Xbox app on my phone: a nice touch. As I am a busy person I have yet to play any real games, but I will update my review with my impressions of gameplay and graphic quality. All in all, at this point, color me impressed!

UPDATE 11/14/17: The One X forces something like 16X anisotropic filtering at all times, and it shows immediately. I booted up Destiny 2, already a beautiful game, and the colors and detail popped much more on a 1080p monitor than on the regular Xbox One. I still saw some aliasing, which isn't surprising since it's still running the basic assets. Next month, Bungie will patch the game to 4K, at which point the aliasing should disappear and the game will look eye-bleedingly good.

UPDATE 11/16/17: Halo 5 is the only game I currently own which has the 4K patch available. The result on a 1080p monitor is unbelievable. I have never seen a game look this good on a console.

50225,8015,4489,"The Xbox One X in short is a great experience for any gamer! Here are the facts!

Pros:
1. Xb1X gives every game regardless of age a very huge increase in preformace.
It also completely removes frametearing on older games that had it.
2. Xb1X 4K bluray playback looks beautiful, see the pictures. I don't use hdr so the bug everyone using hdr doesn't effect me. I watch movies in perfect quality.
3. Native 4K gaming seriously ripped me out of my chair! The level of detail is unreal. Tombraider in native 4K is simply GLORIOUS!
4. Xb1X is beyond whisper quiet! This thing is Prius silent! It also stays relatively warm instead of hot.
5. The Scorpio edition packaging is super HIGH-END ! I felt like I was unwrapping a $500 console.

Cons:
1. Serious lack of 1st party games to play in native 4K.
2. Not ""the best resolution, best framerates, no compromise."" Experience I was exited for.
3. Games still crash when running HEAVILY demanding games. For Example, Wwe 2k17 still crashes when in creation mode for long periods of time.
4. Theres only 1TB of storage. Meanwhile, 4K assets are over 90GB! My Xb1S has 2TB..so not sure what happen there on the X.
5. Standard Xbox One X packaging is very cheap and entry-level. Dispite paying the same $500,You are given a marginally less premium unboxing experience.

Overall, this console is fantastic at playing games. And as an owner and lover of ps4 pro and switch, the X does beat the both in image quality on a noticable level. That said, I am still excited to play Spiderman on the pro..so this console changes nothing for me in that respect. If you buy the X make sure its for the RIGHT reasons. I personally like the pc level visuals,and truly enjoy 4K movies. While pc is always more powerful, remember that it also costs alot more to run games in native 4K..even at 30fps.

50284,8905,1205,"If you missed out the first time around, don't be afraid to jump in now!!  Used figures are extremely cheap any more, and even if you want new ones, many of those can be found for about 60% or less of what they were going for originally.  Just double check to ensure it's one of the 80 characters that works with this game if it's the only one you have.  Any figure with a Blue, Orange, or Green bottom liner on the base with assuredly work with this game, assuming it isn't broken completely for whatever reason.

Swap Force is easily considered the best ""Playground"" in the entire Skylanders series.  With Swap Zone challenges, the longest levels in the series, the longest story in the series, PvP battles, PvE Arena mode, Time Challenges, Special Challenges, Great Boss Battles, a plethra of elemental gates, individual Skylander tasks (pretty sure on this one......may have been giants only), and a difficulty slider, most players of the series logged the most hours into this game even if they didn't count it as their favorite.

This is THE Skylanders game to get some play out of your entire collection without getting overly repetitive.  The entire story, All PvE Arena battles, and 25% of the swap zones will be available on the purchase of this game.  This offers a little above the average offering of content in most A list games these days.

In order to play EVERYTHING in the game (which is not necessary, but fun), you will need the following: 6 Swap Force figures w/ the other 6 specialties (digger, sneaker, spinner, speester etc.), a figure of the Earth, Air, Tech, Undead, and Magic Element (which can be taken care of by the 6 Swappers) a Giant of any element, and the Tower of Time and Sheep Wreck Island pieces (all these last 2 have to do is touch the portal once in your game file and you're good.  Borrow them for a second from a friend if they have them.)

The gimmick of ""Swapping"" your skylander's halves around is fun, but many folks enjoy the characters as they come.  The non-swappable Skylanders that premiered in this game are some of the best in the series and a blast to play.  You can't go wrong by just sticking to Skylanders with blue bases (and a single Giant of Course).

50288,5023,4491,"Graphics: yeah... It suffices to say that they aren't great on the Xbox version at least. The textures are very subpar, and the people looks unintentionally cartoonish in a CGI kind of way. I thought that the bikes looked like they were floating slightly above the road instead of actually riding on it. My wife disagreed, she said that it looked like the bikes were sitting on the road in a fixed position, and that the background was the only thing moving. However you think it looks, it doesn't look realistic. There are never any tire tracks either, it more just appears that you Float over puddles of water. When you fall into water, there's no splash, you just disappear when you hit the water. So don't buy this for the graphics...

Gameplay Mechanics: Sadly, this game didn't deliver for the most part in the actual gameplay department either. You got this to hit people off their bikes, right? Well that part of this game sucks. There is a weird disconnect between actually hitting somebody and having them fall off their bikes in any sort of organic way. It's more like you press the button and the person next to you instantly falls off their bike without really being hit. I liked that you can wheelie to ramp off cars in this game, except that it hardly ever works. I also liked that you ride around in an open world and start little missions from icons that you find in that world. They chose to use text message conversations in order to avoid making any cut scenes for the story, which feels really lazy.

- Not the US version (but still works)
- Get it used (New is not worth the price IMO)
- If you want anything for collecting purposes, but it in person.

One thing I am learning from Amazon is that you can't be sure what you will get. Basically, You will most ;likely get a foreign version of whatever you are ordering. This is the Malaysian UAE etc version. Yes it will still play ( I just tested it) but I can't say whether it will save properly (it should).  Not sure how I feel about this.

You see, I am a bit of a collector and unfortunately I am starting late on collecting games and systems I knew I always wanted to keep. Some of these I'd like to remain new.

50318,751,400,"My first introduction to the Fallout series was with 4 on the PS4, so i am a little late to the party. I grabbed this because I wanted to get some use out of my dusty PS3. The game LOOKS remarkable for being last gen title. There is obviously some stiffness in the NPCs during dialog sections, but nothing too horrible. The highly polished voice acting, gameplay, and narrative will carry this game through most of the blemishes.

The main quest is fine enough, but the real bread and butter of these games are the side quests. There was one in particular where you have to figure out what happened to Boone's wife when you get to Novac. Its a neat little mystery, and the culprit turned out to be the last person I expected. It was really well done.

There are factions and good/bad options to most decisions in this game. You may think you are making a good decision that should help the citizens of the town you are in, but somehow it backfires and someone gets pissed at you. You just never know what one decision can reveal. Very fun actually. Makes your presence in the game actually have an impact. You can be a total jerk and help no one or try and do the right thing.

The game is pretty impressive for being last gen, but there are definitely issues with it. Some that I have encountered myself, but thankfully I was spared of the more dreadful ones.

1. Lag. This one seems to be inescapable. You will get a small dips now and then just as part of usual gameplay. Every now and then the game will become a slideshow and drop to like 2 frames a second. I have never seen something so bad. For me it clears up after a second, but some people claim to have to hard reset their consoles to fix it.

2. Crashing or freezing. Another thing that is prevalent on other reviews here and game forums. The game will flat out refuse to move and you must power down, or it will just power down itself during gameplay. Have not experienced this, but it does come up a lot.

3. Corrupted saves. Also pops up a lot. The number one advice people give when playing these games is to have multiple save points in case one gets corrupted so you don't lose your progress. So far so good for me on this as well. May have just jinxed myself though.

All n all, this game is great when it works as intended. But when it starts getting nasty, it really does go right into the toilet. If I had paid full price for this game when it was released with these issues, I would have rated this a 1 star game. Heck, I probably would have been annoyed paying even  $20. In the end, I got this game for $5 practically brand new. Now there is a good price to give this game a whirl.",first introduct fallout seri 4 ps4 littl late parti grab want get use dusti ps3 game look remark last gen titl obvious stiff npc dialog section noth horribl highli polish voic act gameplay narr carri game blemish main quest fine enough real bread butter game side quest one particular figur happen boon wife get novac neat littl mysteri culprit turn last person expect realli well done faction goodbad option decis game may think make good decis help citizen town somehow backfir someon get piss never know one decis reveal fun actual make presenc game actual impact total jerk help one tri right thing game pretti impress last gen definit issu encount thank spare dread one 1 lag one seem inescap get small dip part usual gameplay everi game becom slideshow drop like 2 frame second never seen someth,1510876800,3

50363,8356,2113,"Rock Band 4, in my opinion didn't get the love it deserved when it was first launched in 2015. Whoever is at fault - either Mad Catz for the lack of production of peripherals at launch like Harmonix claims, or if it was Harmonix for the lack of promo to get sales up like Mad Catz claims, or if the genre just ran it's course from over saturation in the 2007 to 2011 stretch. You can claim who or whatever you want, but the truth is, Rock band 4 is a solid title, and still a fantastic party game for everyone!

I was able to get all my Rock Band 3 songs over to Rock Band 4, which to me surprise also included all the Rock Band 1 and 2 tracks. Apparently, if you have exported your Rock Band 1 and 3 track into Rock band three on your Xbox 360 in the past, they come along in the $15 export purchase for Rock Band 4. I was aware of this, as I ready it was to late to export Rock Band 1 and 2 into Rock Band 4, but that's only if you are trying to export them directly into 4. I already exported them into Rock Band 3 for my 360, so they all came over to 4 which was a pleasent surprise.

There is a $30 expansion to Rock Band 4 called 'Rivals' which adds online play and a couple of offline/local play options as well. There is some people complaining about paying the $30 for an add-on of online play, and although I can see where they are coming from, I am also willing to support Harmonix and purchase it. Harmonix is an independent company now, and they are some what on their own. PdP, who took over for Mad Catz when they went under helps out, but there is still licensing that they need to cover for music and to keep servers up and running, ect. So I purchased the expansion without any issues.

Game play wise, there is not much to talk about. If you are a fan of previous Rock Band titles, the core game play is exactly the same. They didn't go into a different direction like Guitar Hero Live did, so it is new, yet familiar game play. One of the things I absolutely love is the new peripherals. I have not used the PDP ones yet, but Mad Catz did a great job designing  the new instruments - for being plastic controllers of course.

The drums are pretty solid (wireless as well which is nice). The pads are more rubber type instead of Rock Band 1's original clacky and ridiculously loud pads, which makes them a LOT more quiet. They still make a little noise, but nothing more then a standard drum practice pad would.

The guitar itself has a very well done quiet strum bar. The buttons have nice clicks to them, and are nice in size, although if you are use to playing with older Guitar Hero controllers like I was, it will take a little getting use to, but not a deal breaker at all. One of the best features I think, is the audio and video sync option the controller has. I play through a surround sound system, and when the 4k tv and surround sound system both have volume, you can clearly hear latency. So what I do is, turn the TV all the down, turn the surround sound up, and then use the game's calibration tools. The guitar controller has built in Mic and video sensor, making it a breeze to calibrate the game to your sound system of choice. For audio, it makes a click sound and you just hold the guitar up to the speaker. Within seconds the audio is calibrated. You then do the same for video. You just hold the guitar up to the TV, start the video calibrator, and it flashes white on the screen to calibrate the video. The end result is a dead on accurate setup, making it easier to hit notes on the screen. I ended up manually calibrating the game at first, and I was missing notes and runs I was clearly hitting. But once I used the auto calibrator, it ran fantastic.

The add on DLC songs is where it is at, as the on disc sound track is not the strongest. I knew this going in, but I love a lot of the DLC they are offering on the store. Each song is $1.99 or there are special collection packs you can get.

Overall I love Rock Band 4. Some of the customization options for your characters are a little lack luster,and even the the Rivals expansion adds some more to  the collection, it's not as strong as previous installments of the game. But if you are into it for just the good 'ol fun game play, you can't beat it.

If you are a fan of the franchise, I would recommend Rock Band 4. Esecially if you plan on buying the Rock Band 3 export and the Rivals expansion. With the band bundles currently being about $170 here on Amazon, it is the cheapest it has been since it launched. I am enjoying the title very much.",rock band 4 opinion didnt get love deserv first launch 2015 whoever fault either mad catz lack product peripher launch like harmonix claim harmonix lack promo get sale like mad catz claim genr ran cours satur 2007 2011 stretch claim whatev want truth rock band 4 solid titl still fantast parti game everyon abl get rock band 3 song rock band 4 surpris also includ rock band 1 2 track appar export rock band 1 3 track rock band three xbox 360 past come along 15 export purchas rock band 4 awar readi late export rock band 1 2 rock band 4 that tri export directli 4 alreadi export rock band 3 360 came 4 pleasent surpris 30 expans rock band 4 call rival add onlin play coupl offlineloc play option well peopl complain pay 30 addon onlin play although see come also will support harmonix purchas harmonix independ compani pdp took,1510963200,5

50371,8995,3499,"Fallout 3 is one of the greatest games of all time.

I know that last sentence seems over the top, but I don't give praise like that lightly, so take it as the true endorsement it is.  As a role-playing game Fallout 3 offers you a great deal of choice; who do you want to side with, what type of person is your character, how do you advance your abilities--all these and more are left to you.  The story writing is excellent and there is an incredible amount of attention give even in the minutiae.  You might find a remote home on the map with no connection to any quest or story in the game that still has a developed NPC (non-player character) who offers humor, sadness, or greater insight into the world of the game.  Another strength of this game is the open-world design.  While I am not always a fan of open-world games, this one, being set in Washington, DC, keeps things feeling fresh and interesting because of the richness of the locale.  DC has such a wealth of famous landmarks, government buildings, military bases, and subway tunnels that you really feel like you are in post-apocalyptic America.  The attention to detail with the Metro (subway) system in particular was downright eerie.  On top of all of this the gameplay itself was fun and satisfying; there is the usual assortment of weapons, armor, companions, and abilities to keep things interesting.

There are, of course, some flaws.  You will likely, at some point, find or do something that makes the game crash.  Likewise, as the game is now older, you may have to tweak it to make it work correctly.  But it will be completely worth it.

Overall this is a phenomenal game that you can easily, even with just playing the core stories, spend over a hundred hours playing.  The story, setting, and variety of characters, abilities, and weapons makes this a ton of fun.

The Xbox 360 wireless controllers are great, but being wireless, you are going to need a battery for them.  While are first glance it seems logical to get the battery pack built for the controller by Xbox itself, it is ultimately an unnecessary expense.  If you buy this battery pack then you also need to buy the special charging station for it.  This charging station can charge two battery packs at a time, but only the Xbox battery packs, it doesn't charge anything else.  You would be saving both time and money to instead invest in a set of normal AA rechargeable batteries and a normal battery charger which will not only charge faster, but also give you batteries that be be used in other electronic devices.

Aside from the fact that this just doesn't make sense to buy, there seems to be some quality control issues with these battery packs, especially the novelty colored ones.  Some worked great, but others held a charge poorly or drained too quickly.

50408,2749,1056,"Why one star,  numerous reviews show the poor quality the mic tends to break after while lowering the mic allows you to speak through it when you raise the mic it automatically mutes it but numerous reviews with people that only's have had them break and have many problems with the mic,

 Some say the mixer box on the old GEN 2, 50s versus the newer one missing USB port  many find the USB port easier to use but the new one does have the mini jack to USb.

Many headsets are only virtual 7.1 or 5.1 many of them don't have the drivers built-in and therefore just do a virtual through the program of the computer and many of them you must already have a sound card in your PC to take advantage of the 7.1 ,  these headsets are only 5.1  and the mixing box that comes with this unit is basically its own soundcard quality wise is so so listening to a lot of reviews and other people you cannot replace the soundcard on the computers there's nothing compatible we made better currently.

We were considering these and one of the big points the Astro utilizes is the connecting one another to each other versus the chain which allows you to talk to one another through the headsets and the mixer and not through I don't mean  the computer so basically you can connect whatever bunch of friends only you guys can hear each other.

 For the money you can definitely get a better headset with true drivers and not virtual through the program or software.

 A lot of reviews talk about the quality and the changes and apparently over the years to change the headsets may take quite a bit of money one small piece could cost millions of dollars so the improvements may take or may just go to a new headset.

 We have not found an X ternal sound card versus the internal sound cards which are very good no one company yet as built an extern all say like the sound blaster where you could connected through the USB and then plug-in your stuff everything is still very separate.  So buying the equipment one has to pick and choose very carefully because the industry has a lot of stuff out there which is kind of all over the place.

 Another big problem is a lot of things are written for 5.1 and not 7.1 ( remember 7.1 has to be written into the programs that you can hear it this way if it's not it won't work ) 7.1 is fairly new and a lot of companies still say that the programmers haven't really program 7.1 only 5.1. There is still a lot of controversy and software update needed as we move into the future down the road 100% these issues will be solved but how long one does not know.

 Many people tend to like the wireless over the wired because there's so many wires want to comes  into the computer,  PlayStation and Xbox etc...

 The more buttons and batteries the heavier the headset is to,  add of multiple reviews many viewers tend to like the light headsets and the cotton material over the leather.  Sound quality is a big one and most of the top and headsets are pretty close to one another

2017 newest models Many people tend to like the 40s over the 50s they just feel well gaming they are just more convenient and features are readily available to them versus the wireless 50s for 2017.

And rightly so.
Pros:
Combat great
Weapons are diverse and upgradable

Cons:
A little platforming?!?! It's half the game when it used to have no place in DMC
Cutscene - neverplayed DMC to watch a movie, just to kick demon ass - but these guys figured they had a blockbuster on their hands - fortunately you can skip them
Game way to short - so once all the platforming and cutscenes are removed, you are left with a shell of a DMC game  and little combat

50525,4883,3987,"I bought this Sims 4 Get To Work expansion pack on Origin because I was able to get a good deal on it. I am not saying this expansion pack isn't worth the regular price of $40, but it's a lot of money for me to spend right now so I wait for a good sale to come around for The Sims 4 expansion packs before I buy them. I have really wanted this expansion pack for a while but I wasn't sure I would like everything about it particularly the idea of my Sims getting sick a lot and the fact that this expansion pack comes with aliens. So far, the illnesses and the aliens have not really affected my gameplay and I have played with it a few days now. I really like the idea of the detective career that comes with this expansion pack, but it is hard and a little discouraging at first because my Sims was given a tough first case and I couldn't find any clues, so the game said my Sim did a terrible job the first day. At least my Sims wasn't fired I guess. The doctor career started out much smoother for another one of my Sims that I tried it with. The doctor career is easier in my opinion, but maybe I am just better at being a doctor/healthcare provider. The detective career is fun and gets easier to do after a few days of doing it since your Sim will get promoted and you get different cases and assignments to do with it. I haven't tried out the Scientist career yet, but I wasn't excited about that one really since I am not a Science fan. I will eventually try it out probably since it is supposed to be fun to do. The retail businesses sound and look fun too, but I am more interested in trying out the actual careers right now so I will wait on trying those out. The retail businesses are flexible because you can sell anything in them as long as it's in buy mode or you make, as far as I understand it, which is nice. This expansion pack comes with a lot of new hairstyles, clothing, and accessories which is impressive and appealing to me also because I love getting new hairstyles, clothing, and accessories for my Sims to use. I also like that you can decide if you want to go to work with your Sims or if you want to let them go by themselves for the three new careers that come with this expansion pack. I would have liked it if this expansion pack came with a few more careers like the ghost hunter and education careers, but I understand that only so many careers can be included in it.  I would recommend this Sims 4 Get To Work expansion pack because it comes with lots of new objects/items and it adds a lot of new gameplay and career options.",bought sim 4 get work expans pack origin abl get good deal say expans pack isnt worth regular price 40 lot money spend right wait good sale come around sim 4 expans pack buy realli want expans pack wasnt sure would like everyth particularli idea sim get sick lot fact expans pack come alien far ill alien realli affect gameplay play day realli like idea detect career come expans pack hard littl discourag first sim given tough first case couldnt find clue game said sim terribl job first day least sim wasnt fire guess doctor career start much smoother anoth one sim tri doctor career easier opinion mayb better doctorhealthcar provid detect career fun get easier day sinc sim get promot get differ case assign havent tri scientist career yet wasnt excit one realli sinc scienc fan eventu tri probabl sinc suppos,1511395200,5

In a next gen PS4 console the LONG Load times are terribly unforgivable. The long load times alone are worthy of a one star review! Just Cause 3 does earn its one star because; the explosions are MAD AWESOME, The fire mechanic is awesome too. Watching Just Cause 3 Oxygen tanks take off into the sky and blow up just never gets old for me.

However Just Cause 3 has more wrong with it than right. Example the world is empty as in devoid of life save a few goats. Weather changes rarely, there is no day night cycle to speak of like in the Far Cry series. The enemies are just wave generated garbage that spawn over and over again. The way points are white dots against light or white backgrounds making them often invisible and useless! Do I really have to tell video game developers about the importance of CONTRAST FOR WAYPOINTS! A small white way point set against a white back ground is USELESS! The invisible white waypoints would not be so bad if they did not have a timed mini game embedded that requires you to use the invisible way points to find equally invisible inaccessible monitor stations to liberate villages. I threw Just Cause 3 away after giving up on trying to use its invisible waypoints during the timed mini game. In every badly designed video game like Just Cause 3 you can always count on their being a really rotten ill conceived mini game that ruins the rest of the game play!

The car driving mechanic is sluggish and actually worse than what was done in Just Cause 2 PS3. The cars, trucks, helicopters and other vehicles themselves are greatly improved over Just Cause 2. The Just Cause 3 environment while dead and barren of wild life is extremely pretty. The Just Cause 3 Game mechanics are far more sloppy and unresponsive to input than those in Just Cause 2. Controlling the tether was next to impossible because the double tether and single pull tether were controlled by the same button never a good idea in a badly executed game like Just Cause 3.

Bad design decisions made Just Cause 3 timed monitor mini game extremely difficult to play. The dead environment made Just Cause 3 a very boring open world game. The wave generated enemies that spawned forever made the game a slog without a sense of accomplishment or purpose! The Just Cause 3 AI was pretty good in most instances. The long load screens were criminal as were the invisible wonky way points. So in summary Just Cause 3 was an EPIC FAIL! I'm lucky to have purchased this when it was in the bargain bin so not much money lost in throwing this badly designed garbage away!",game terribl absolut terribl first load time ridicul think mass effect 1 dead space 1 elev ride load time long next gen ps4 consol long load time terribl unforgiv long load time alon worthi one star review caus 3 earn one star explos mad awesom fire mechan awesom watch caus 3 oxygen tank take sky blow never get old howev caus 3 wrong right exampl world empti devoid life save goat weather chang rare day night cycl speak like far cri seri enemi wave gener garbag spawn way point white dot light white background make often invis useless realli tell video game develop import contrast waypoint small white way point set white back ground useless invis white waypoint would bad time mini game embed requir use invis way point find equal invis inaccess monitor station liber villag threw caus 3 away give tri use invis waypoint time mini game everi badli design video game like caus 3 alway count realli rotten ill conceiv mini game ruin rest game play car drive mechan sluggish actual wors done caus 2 ps3,1511481600,1

50594,2749,2493,"2017 latest models and updates,  even in the gaming world 40s are the ruler

Tested on pc  it has accessories for Xbox PlayStation and so forth

 We believe these are really good headset lighter than the 50s you don't have to worry about the battery the charging base and again the wait is later

 You can plug the Astro 50 headset  into USB to charge them and continue to play (  or you can charge them on the magnetic base )  many people have found some issues with the magnetic base being a little tricky or charging the headsets useing the USB so just buy the 40s and you'll never worry about the batteries are having to charge them ever again

no issues direct connect with the 40s all wired,  no batteries no issues  and they are a little lighter than the 50s

 We did a lot of reviews and research on the a40 versus the 50s  and time and time again a40 wins

 In the gamers world over and over again they say take the 40s don't touch the 50s,  50+ reviews we stopped reading after that

 Again I hope this helps others and we believe this is a good headset and the best out of the bunch turtle beach also has a good headset but in the long run it seems that the gamers like to daisychain and they like the mix amp and the way it's laid out so there's a lot a key features that work well with the 40s and way people choose these over the 50s

 Another note which is very important is the generation one you cannot hold down the button for 3 to 5 seconds and change it over the PC only the latest the TR the older model says max amperage amp max on it not TR so there's been some confusion and stuff like that on the mix amps but the newest mix tr,  you can hold the button down for 3 to five seconds and it does change it over to PC  and it will go from a red color to a white color on the power switch.  There are three generations out generation 1,2 and three  three being the latest with the most latest software and it also uses the command center the command center cannot be used on the generation one mix amp

Note*** Generation one headset does not have magnetic ear pads ---( sorry to say the mod kit for changing the ear piece and a few other accessories many are saying it's not worth it and it changes the acoustic sound that the stock earmuffs piece is the better of them,  we have not tested it just to let you know ),  The generation three has magnetic ear pads you can take them off and replace them with the mod kits and so forth like that,  also note there is a small tags on the headsets the CTR generation one does not do that,  not sure about generation 2 sorry about that.

 Generation one versus generation three  Cable changes  ******Generation three Toslink Male to Toslink Male Digital Optical optical to optical *****generation one has Toslink Male to Mini Toslink Male Digital Optical optical plug so the mix amps have  different connections,  yes the generation three mix amp is preferred specially the optical to optical

 Generation one amp mix headset update is the older update you cannot use the command center on the generation one only the generation three the newest and latest headsets out  Will work with Astro's latest software that's out

 We went ahead and bought the after market mod kit Astro a40 TR even know a lot of reviews had people talking negatives, we really like it that's our opinion we got it were using it and we like it that's all we can say it's for us we really like it

The mod kit has thicker pads on the ears and the head pad and they are leather, as well as the mic is upgraded it's different than the stock Miic and the  plastic outside covers  have rubber inside them versus the stock ones which do not have the rubber in them",2017 latest model updat even game world 40 ruler test pc accessori xbox playstat forth believ realli good headset lighter 50 dont worri batteri charg base wait later plug astro 50 headset usb charg continu play charg magnet base mani peopl found issu magnet base littl tricki charg headset use usb buy 40 youll never worri batteri charg ever issu direct connect 40 wire batteri issu littl lighter 50 lot review research a40 versu 50 time time a40 win gamer world say take 40 dont touch 50 50 review stop read hope help other believ good headset best bunch turtl beach also good headset long run seem gamer like daisychain like mix amp way laid there lot key featur work well 40 way peopl choos 50 anoth note import gener one cannot hold button 3 5 second chang pc latest tr older model say max amperag amp max,1511568000,5

50604,1323,4489,"First off I want to say I'm a gamer. I did not get this console for the 4K blu-ray player or because I'm a die hard Xbox fan. I got this so that I could play Xbox One/360 and the occasional original Xbox game on the best Xbox console available. This is my first Xbox One console so I won't be able to compare it with older models but I do have every other console out right now including a newer gaming PC with 4K monitor. I do all my console gaming on a 1080p projector so I was mainly interested in performance and not 4K. With all that being said I just have a couple personal pros and cons.

My likes: So yeah, the Xbox One X enhanced games look awesome! The first game I downloaded was Halo 5 and was instantly impressed on how smooth and stable the game felt from a console! Definitely impressive although the insane file size of 95GB! The way this game looks even on my 1080p screen I felt outweighed some of my frustrations. I still think its an awesome piece of tech. probably more for enthusiasts than casuals. The console itself is small yet heavy which just makes it feel like a quality product

My dislikes: The Xbox dashboard itself is just absolutely terrible! It feels like everything important is hidden away while things like advertisements are right on the home screen. It's also incredibly slow and unstable even on the ""most powerful console ever made"" The UI feels slower than the dashboard on the original PS4 or even the Xbox360! WTH! The Xbox store app is especially frustrating as it crashes on me pretty much every time I use it! My other gripe, which is the same as everyone else's, is the lack of first party games. I already knew this before purchasing but I felt it even harder as I scrolled through the Xbox store on my brand new console with not a lot of decent games to download! Lastly, no rechargeable batteries for Xbox One controllers....yeah... still in 2017 apparently its still an issue, this just drives me nuts.

I recommend this console mainly to those that are strictly console gamer's and cant wait for the next gen consoles to come out. You definitely get PC like performance on this with Xbox One X Enhanced games. If you're like me than you are probably unbiased on consoles, and just enjoy gaming, which means you should buy this just so you can have it and be able play any game that comes out!",first want say im gamer get consol 4k bluray player im die hard xbox fan got could play xbox one360 occasion origin xbox game best xbox consol avail first xbox one consol wont abl compar older model everi consol right includ newer game pc 4k monitor consol game 1080p projector mainli interest perform 4k said coupl person pro con like yeah xbox one x enhanc game look awesom first game download halo 5 instantli impress smooth stabl game felt consol definit impress although insan file size 95gb way game look even 1080p screen felt outweigh frustrat still think awesom piec tech probabl enthusiast casual consol small yet heavi make feel like qualiti product dislik xbox dashboard absolut terribl feel like everyth import hidden away thing like advertis right home screen also incred slow unstabl even power consol ever made ui feel slower dashboard origin ps4 even xbox360 wth xbox store app especi frustrat crash pretti much everi time use gripe everyon el,1511568000,4

I just wish it would cool my system better at idle as i pretty much just use my Xbox to run netflix and BlueDisc. Maybe add a manually adjustable fan in future Revisions.

Now for the noise, its pretty quiet tbh. I just have one issue after having it for a month i noticed a rattling noise that was driving me nuts so finally i lifted up the cooler and the noise stopped.

50612,2749,3989,"We are sorry to say this but this is the truth a40 with amp mixer having  some research and reviews

After careful review's many said the 50 have some problems they have batteries in them and switches on them and they're heavier than the a40, plus The A40 gets to use mix amp  which makes it very easy adjusting the volume for game or voice

 After very careful research the a40 is much lighter and many users prefer this over the 50s and with the 50s they will always have batteries in them And will always be  heavier

 Another issue is the magnetic base charging the headsets can be tricky and yes you can use USB connected to them constantly but why not just get that the a40 wired and never worry about batteries.

Read many reviews and I hope that this helps others,  in the gaming industry the gamers choose the 40 over the 50,  you can also daisy chain the 40s  also many to many reviews stated that the 40s have a better presets setting and controls then the 50s",sorri say truth a40 amp mixer research review care review mani said 50 problem batteri switch theyr heavier a40 plu a40 get use mix amp make easi adjust volum game voic care research a40 much lighter mani user prefer 50 50 alway batteri alway heavier anoth issu magnet base charg headset tricki ye use usb connect constantli get a40 wire never worri batteri read mani review hope help other game industri gamer choos 40 50 also daisi chain 40 also mani mani review state 40 better preset set control 50,1511568000,1

50640,952,4320,"Well, I'm sorry to be the one who says the emperor's wearing no clothes, but IMO -- shared by a fellow veteran gamer who's a close friend -- this game isn't as fun to play as it is awesome to look at.

The problem is: the battles here are VERY difficult at the normal setting.  It's you and your bow and arrow versus hordes of bad guys and robot animals, the latter in some cases sporting fire and ray blasts of various kinds.

Bows and arrows of course take time to load, draw, and aim.  The melee controls also seem to have an agonizing lag time between the moment you press the button and your character reacts.

So while you're messing with your quiver or trying to reload your health meter or craft more arrows, robot monsters are busy unleashing a mess of hurting on you, including fire, energy blasts, and the ever-effective jump-in-the-air-and-land-on-your-sorry-butt move.

I tried the game's easy setting, and that was still too hard.  So I tried the ""story"" setting -- and that was probably too easy.

So this game seems to lack a difficulty setting that feels just right.  Though I'm a senior, I have been playing video games for decades and know a game ""that plays like butter"" when I find it.  HZD ain't that game!

Otherwise the heroine here is kind of a snooze, there are untold but uninteresting intricacies of plot and place, and occasional attempts at humor that fall flat with a thud.

This game does triumph in the look of this post-apocalyptic world, the costumes of the various tribes, and the multiple varieties of machine animals.

But ultimately, is this game fun to play?  IMO no -- not like the Uncharted games, the Just Cause series, Ratchet & Clank, or others I could name.

It's a shame because obviously a lot of very talented people have worked very hard to make this world come to life.

UPDATE: after playing this game for many more hours, I might also add that the cut scenes need -- cutting.  Many of them go on WAY too long, like five minutes or more.  Blah blah blah.  Yak yak yak.  Geez, when do I get back to playing this game already???

Let me say it again: the first and foremost criterion for evaluating a game remains ""is it fun to play?""  With its daunting difficulty settings, balky controls, and interminable cut scenes, HZD falls short on this paramount fun factor.",well im sorri one say emperor wear cloth imo share fellow veteran gamer who close friend game isnt fun play awesom look problem battl difficult normal set bow arrow versu hord bad guy robot anim latter case sport fire ray blast variou kind bow arrow cours take time load draw aim mele control also seem agon lag time moment press button charact react your mess quiver tri reload health meter craft arrow robot monster busi unleash mess hurt includ fire energi blast evereffect jumpintheairandlandonyoursorrybutt move tri game easi set still hard tri stori set probabl easi game seem lack difficulti set feel right though im senior play video game decad know game play like butter find hzd aint game otherwis heroin kind snooz untold uninterest intricaci plot place occasion attempt humor fall flat thud game triumph look postapocalypt world costum variou tribe multipl varieti machin anim ultim game fun play imo like unchart game caus seri ratchet clank other could name,1511654400,3

50655,9068,1166,"I was extremely disappointed. Loved the first game, the second was a masterpiece, and the third was just as fun as the others. This one...ugh, what a beautiful mess.
First off, it is the prettiest game I've ever played, by far. Combat and movement is smooth as silk; the characters' mannerisms are believable and the acting is spot-on, as usual. All that said, the story is unbelievably dull, especially when compared to the last ones. A half-hour in, I was trying to convince myself I wasn't bored and that the adventure would pick up soon enough. It did for one or two sequences, then it was back to the slog. In the third game, you escape a sinking cruise-ship, a crashing plane, and a collapsing lost city, among many other things; in this game...to be honest, I've already forgotten what happens.
With the success of The Last of Us, it makes some sense that the studio would want to make another Uncharted game that was even more cinematic than the previous ones. In order to do this, they sacrificed exciting gameplay for overdone ""realism."" Let me put it another way: if Uncharted 4 was an actual movie instead of a game, it would be a really dumb movie (much like the fourth Indiana Jones). I'm not going to spoil anything, but a significant number of plot points were utterly stupid. Sure, same for the other ones from time to time but, since they felt like proper video games, I suspended my disbelief easily. This, in its effort to be more realistic, didn't feel like a game and didn't feel like a good movie. I will gladly forget it in time.",extrem disappoint love first game second masterpiec third fun other oneugh beauti mess first prettiest game ive ever play far combat movement smooth silk charact manner believ act spoton usual said stori unbeliev dull especi compar last one halfhour tri convinc wasnt bore adventur would pick soon enough one two sequenc back slog third game escap sink cruiseship crash plane collaps lost citi among mani thing gameto honest ive alreadi forgotten happen success last u make sen studio would want make anoth unchart game even cinemat previou one order sacrif excit gameplay overdon realism let put anoth way unchart 4 actual movi instead game would realli dumb movi much like fourth indiana jone im go spoil anyth signific number plot point utterli stupid sure one time time sinc felt like proper video game suspend disbelief easili effort realist didnt feel like game didnt feel like good movi gladli forget time,1511740800,2

50693,2749,1801,"The  turtle beach elite pro 2017 vs a40 Astro gen 3 2017 headsets

Weight  turtle beach is a little heavier than the Astro a 40s, sounds  turtle beach in Astro are pretty comparable I believe turtle beach has a lower frequency but I couldn't really tell a difference between the headsets sound wise in less you're looking for that specific sound.  And testing it at that point both sound pretty good.  We could not get the turtle beach Mic to work sorry about that,  also note that the mic tends to fall down it doesn't stay in place as securely as the Astro headset ,  our PC or headset I'm not sure.

Comfort both headsets feel really comfortable we prefer the Astros a little bit more than the turtle beach and comfort I don't know if it's because the turtle beach is heavier and the Astros later but when wearing them the Astros To us feel better

Pros and cons, Turtle Beach headset you cannot swap the mic from the left or right side and the earmuffs are not magnetically in place you cannot pull them off like the Astro a 40s.

 After getting these in trying them those are feelings we had to return turtle beaches headset but overall we tend to like the Astros better based on wearing them and using them even though we had a little bit of a problem with the mic on the turtle beaches.

 We truly feel for the money the  astro a 40 headset is the better buy  that's our opinions based on all the reviews and research

below our reviews and research based on opinions of others

 The Astro a 40 headset is still lighter and more comfortable stated in many reviews  in the long run personal preference may appeal sound quality as well but overall the Astros tend to be a little bit better headset even know there's a lot of debate, maybe in the years to come they'll change a few other things but currently Astro  doesn't have as many complaints about the mic's looseness  was still sits on, I don't know if it's the developers the designers with the money or what I'm not sure why this is but it is what it is

 Even wearing glasses it's always been a controversy it's always uncomfortable wearing glasses and headsets.  It's always going to be more comfortable wearing no glasses.

you do the research and find out for yourself,  A 40s not the 50s from Astro,  again people say take the a40 over the 50s, yes the A40 is not wireless but in the long run is much better,  also just to add a note the community advises against the mod kit for the Astro the standard earpieces do better for whatever reason but many of the tests people prefer the standard earpieces over the modded just thought you'd like to know.  Again a lot of these things are important to pay attention to so you don't waste your money and you try to get the best headset currently available on the market.

The headset elite is somewhat close and sound quality maybe user preference to the Astro a40  people tend to prefer the Astro mix amp

Then friends got online, i played with them for about an hour and the nightmare started i was on the Xbox live party some of my friends were playing GTA V and i was playing with another friend Infinity Warfare Zombie and a loud static noise happen really annoying so i thought it was one of my friends mic doing that but to my surprise it wasn't it was me ridiculous right! out of the box didn't even get to play much and this thing is already broken!!, or and there not really easy on your ears wanted to point that out.
I contacted Astro Support via email lest see how long it takes for a reply i give them 3 days if i don't get an answer this things are going bac for full refund. I try all the troubleshooting on the support site and apparently is the Mixamp the one with the issue.
In 3 days time i be in market for a new set but this time i will research a bit longer before i go and buy anything with a hefty price tag that breaks after a few hours of play time!

Update 12/4/17, Support from Astro was very slow to reply (4+ days) no phone # to call just email., they did not offer any help other than to upgrade firmware, after i did that a few times on my own their advice/request came after, so i was able to do multiple updates, and now the headset seems to be working fine no more static, so i was quick to judge the quality or the product bf checking all the facts and without enough troubleshooting in my part no thanks to Astro i might add, but everything okay now so i'm changing it to 4 stars, I will update again if something goes wrong but i will take all measures/troubleshooting bf i come back and complaint lol.

People on here have been complaining about the mic, but for me it works perfectly. It picks my voice up clear as a bell with perfect volume, and it doesn't pick up my extraordinarily loud mechanical keyboard whatsoever.

50733,2280,98,"This review is for the digital apex edition.

Includes the game and a bunch of add on stuff including Flame Fang Sabretooth Skin, Storm Cloud Owl Skin, Ash Back Mammoth Skin, Quick Path Gatherer, Quick Path Crafter, Wenja Hunter Paint, Legend of the Mammoth, Blood Shasti, Quick Path Warrior, and Quick Path Hunter.

I originally started playing the Far Cry Series after getting the Far Cry Collection that included Far Cry 2, 3 and Blood Dragon a couple years ago.  Although I found the collection and series a bit hit and miss to me as I thought Far Cry 2 was just ok but a bit frustrating because of its save quirks and being an older game, the gameplay was a bit dated and I felt Blood Dragon was a bit of a disappointment.  But I enjoyed playing both Far Cry 3 and 4 as they are both fun and action packed with good storylines.

So, I have been looking forward to something a bit different with the Far Cry Series and after the Primal Apex edition dropped to 16 bucks for black Friday, I grabbed it as I figured I couldn't go wrong at that price.

Primal has a different setting and look but has the familiar feel of FC3 and 4.  The biggest difference in gameplay is the ancient weapons versus the modern ones that were in FC3 and 4.  I personally found it a bit more challenging to use the prehistoric weapons than the previous FC games.  One small issue for me was how hard it was to see the aiming dot as it seems to blend into the background sometimes.  There are times when it seems that the enemies have an easier time spotting and hitting you than they should as well they sometimes also blend into the backgrounds.  Both are relatively minor issues for me though.

If you are familiar with the gameplay of the previous FC games, it is pretty easy to jump right into the game and get going without much difficulty at understanding the game.  Ubisoft tends to stick with what  works and although the game has a familiar feel the changes made give this game enough to feel different and fun.  With that said though, there is some repetitiveness with some of the collecting and side missions that the FC games tend to have that can be a bit annoying.

Like FC4, the graphics in this are beautifully done with gorgeous prehistoric landscapes with great audio to match.  The story is good, maybe not as good as the previous games, but I found it interesting enough to keep me invested in playing the game.  The animal taming is a pretty cool feature as well as the other abilities you can add via skill points.

If you like the previous games in the series, especially FC3 and 4, you will most likely like Primal, although I will say that if you prefer modern weapons and a variety of weapons, you may be a bit disappointed here.  I personally am enjoying the game and it will keep me busy enough until the next entry in the series.

50774,9068,1472,"This was one of the first games I played on PS3; at that time, I didn't appreciate it as much as, say, Uncharted or God of War II, but it was good. Having just played it again recently, I was shocked at how much fun it is.
It's a simple, arcade-style shooter with mechs, aliens, and an anime-like storyline (though you won't miss much by skipping over the cutscenes). It features 11 missions which range from ten minutes to over an hour of play-time, each complete with a boss battle. Now, here's what's so great about it: the sheer diversity of everything. There are a bunch of different mechs you can pilot, each with different capabilities; every level has a unique design, from snow-drenched cities to volcanic caverns; there are loads of weapons and plenty of opportunities to try them out; and you're pitted against such variant enemies--humans, machines, giant snow worms, alien insects, etc.
Besides all that, the gameplay can get a bit choppy when there's a whole lot going on (i.e. most boss battles) and the constantly declining health bar forces you to keep moving and shooting, which may be a turn-off for many players. I, however, attest that the game would be way too easy without this feature. The average gamer could finish this in two to three sittings which, for such an inexpensive game, is a pretty good deal.
If you find yourself still breaking out the ole PS3 and want to try something satisfying, this is highly recommended.",one first game play ps3 time didnt appreci much say unchart god war ii good play recent shock much fun simpl arcadestyl shooter mech alien animelik storylin though wont miss much skip cutscen featur 11 mission rang ten minut hour playtim complet bos battl here what great sheer diver everyth bunch differ mech pilot differ capabl everi level uniqu design snowdrench citi volcan cavern load weapon plenti opportun tri your pit variant enemieshuman machin giant snow worm alien insect etc besid gameplay get bit choppi there whole lot go ie bos battl constantli declin health bar forc keep move shoot may turnoff mani player howev attest game would way easi without featur averag gamer could finish two three sit inexpens game pretti good deal find still break ole ps3 want tri someth satisfi highli recommend,1511913600,4

I tried the game not expecting much and was VERY surprised of the overall length, quest quality, combat system and personality-atmosphere. This IS Mass Effect. Yes its not Shepard, it doesn't have the same high stakes as the original trilogy, it has janky animation sometimes, but it has:

1- Amazing combat
2- Great planets. Just exploring them makes you feel like in Mass 1 or Interstellar
3- Ryder has great personality and you really play how you want with him (combat and story conversation wise)
4- Art and graphics are amazing
5- Atmosphere. Everything ""clicks"", the Initiative team objectives, conversations, actual gameplay quests, all make sense in their context. The talking, the emails, the stages (planets, ships), all make you feel in the story-narrative. Great job.

The bad:

1- Crap animation cuts or loops sometimes
2- Some Fetch quests (just ignore them)

Pros: good sound quality, high level comfort, easy to use, and comes with a built in microphone that can be unplugged to turn your headset into headphones.

Con: this one surprised me. The last thing I would suspect to be a flaw would be the volume rocker. Simply put, it sucks. It's cheaply made, and hardly works. My volume rocker refuses to change my volume. It only distorts or completely removed it. There is a way around it though. While very annoying and slightly time consuming, I found that pushing the rocker up a little past the max and fiddling with it from there usually fixes it.

50828,76,4320,"Concept 10/10
When you first her about a girl hunting giant robot dinosaurs with a bow, it sounds ridiculous.  But Horizon Zero Dawn successfully combines the combat and tactics of Far Cry, the Parkour and Stealth of Assassin's Creed, and the Narrative and Exploration of the Witcher!  It does this extremely well in a new and unique environment.  If you like any of these games, you should pick this up.

Story 10/10
In the past, mankind relied on robots, but some genius got the idea to all them to self-replicate and feed on bio-mass... or meat.  So the obvious thing happened.  The robots spread like a virus and ate and killed almost all life on Earth.  Centuries later, humans live in primitive tribes and have religious superstitions.  HZD is an origin story for Aloy, a girl who was born without a mother and lived as an outcast.  But it may be her destiny to save the world.

Combat 9/10
With only a light and heavy melee attack and an unlockable dodge, this is primarily a shooter.  Aloy has an arsenal of primitive / sci-fi weapons at her disposal.  Her primary weapon is her bow.  You can equip it with arrows that do elemental damage like fire, ice, shock, and corruption which drives the machines crazy.  In addition to her bows, Aloy can set exploding tripwire traps, proximity bombs, and mines.  There are also primitive heavy weapons in the game that launch projectiles like a machine gun or rocket launcher, but they suffer in accuracy.  The arsenal of weapons gives the player a variety of tactics.  You can rush a group of enemies and take them head on with heavy weapons.  You can use stealth to set traps all over the battlefield before you engage.  You can sneak up on enemies and stealth kill them to thin their numbers.  The variety of tactics when attacking enemy humans or robots gives this game a deep combat system.

When attacking robots, you can use precision shots to blast parts off of the robot.  So, if one of them is shooting at you, you can knock off its weapon, pick it up, and use it to shoot the robot.  Destroying the components on the creature, debuff it and limit its abilities.  So, there is some strategy here, too.

All of the robots and Aloy have resistances to damage types.  Some enemies are weak against fire or ice or shock, and you can buy different types of armor for Aloy and modify it to resist the various damage types in the game.  You can switch armor with the press of a button, even during combat.  So, if you're fighting a creature that uses fire, equip your resist fire armor and its fire will do 30-70 less damage, depending on how you modified it.

Graphics 10/10 The world is beautiful and the animations are smooth.  Killing robot monsters is more visually appealing than killing giant monsters.  Monsters bleed, but robots spark, fall apart, explode, etc...  It makes the battles really satisfying and visually stunning.

Although HZD is a great game and offers hours of open ended adventure, it does have its flaws.
No Health Regen on camping, level up, or visiting a town.  The only way to regain health in the game is to craft or buy potions.  To craft them, you need to hunt animals like foxes, fish, and boars.  The animals give you types of meat and you can combine them to make light, full, or max health boost potions.
Aloy also carries an herbal medicine bag and to fill it, you pick medicinal flowers.  1 flower gives you 10-20 health for your bag.  You can carry 400% of your health bar.  To activate this, just press UP on the D-pad and you will heal.  But you do spend about 15% of the entire game running through the woods picking flowers.
Inconsistent Healing.  You can heal in combat, but not while you are getting hit, dodging, or attacking.  So, there are times when you have to evade, stand still, and then heal.  There is no Dark Souls Potion Drink animation, so this doesn't make sense.  Aloy should be able to heal at any time.  The times you can heal in combat are not obvious to the player.
Skill Tree - About half of the skills in this game are worthless.  The best skills are shoot 2 arrows and 3 arrows at a time.  This is double and triple damage.  Aloy can also slow time while in combat to better aim her shots.  This meter can be boosted.  There are also a few boosts to your melee attacks and a skill that increases your medicine bag from 200 to 400% of your health bar.  The rest (half) of the skills in this game are worthless.
Inconsistent World - This is the cleanest primitive world that I have ever seen and it seriously lacks grit.  Everybody in the world feels like some fresh faced silicon valley employee or liberal arts major, which doesn't really fit a primitive world where robot monsters lurk everywhere.  The guys are pretty wimpy and the old ladies are drill sergeants, which feels really odd.

Maturity:  This is a good game for all ages.  It's like a PG movie with no swearing, just violence against machines and human bad guys.  There isn't any gore either.

Overall 9/10:  The game is fun and will take you 20-30 hours to beat.  After that, there is a New Game+ and some DLC you can enjoy.

If you loved this game, the gameplay of Far Cry is similar, but lacks fantasy.
If you loved this game for the stealth and open world, check out Assassin's Creed.

50849,1482,4222,"I thought this game was enjoyable overall and well worth the price. As others have said, this is a survival game where you will die OFTEN until you begin to develop a survival strategy. Even then, you'll make plenty of mistakes that will likely result in your death which will require you to start over. I'm of mixed opinion on this, on the one hand, it's incredibly annoying to get pretty far along only to die from a relatively stupid mistake and have to start over. On the other hand, it certainly does up the stakes considerably and makes me think carefully before attempting many things which makes the game more engaging. There will come a point where you can develop a technology that allows you to resurrect yourself but even this doesn't allow you to rest easy - there's still plenty of opportunity to die immediately thereafter.

Ultimately, I reached a point where I had discovered most of what there was to discover in the game and the sheer tedium of staying alive outweighed any additional enjoyment that I was going to get out of it. However, by the time I reached this point, I felt I'd gotten my value out of the game so we parted ways amicably. :)  One warning: if you're the type of person who needs to ""finish"" a game, this is not the game for you. There is a ""story mode"" but it's even more difficult than the sandbox mode (and very similar anyway) and you'll probably rip your hair out trying to finish with very little in the way of real story reward from doing so.",thought game enjoy overal well worth price other said surviv game die often begin develop surviv strategi even youll make plenti mistak like result death requir start im mix opinion one hand incred annoy get pretti far along die rel stupid mistak start hand certainli stake consider make think care attempt mani thing make game engag come point develop technolog allow resurrect even doesnt allow rest easi there still plenti opportun die immedi thereaft ultim reach point discov discov game sheer tedium stay aliv outweigh addit enjoy go get howev time reach point felt id gotten valu game part way amic one warn your type person need finish game game stori mode even difficult sandbox mode similar anyway youll probabl rip hair tri finish littl way real stori reward,1512000000,4

HAPPY STEP-SON!  GREAT SOUND!
Got this pair of Headphones for my musically talented video creator step-son. We've been a Sades loyal family for several years now. He says he cannot believe the realism and clarity. I can attest that the mic is clear and without static or hum.

50947,8626,1466,"Three stars for the following reasons:

Good:
- Wireless/wired
- Customized key bindings
- Ability to create profiles
- Active battery power monitoring with recharging cradle

Bad:
- Lacks nib on the 5 key to get a sense of finger position (-0.5)
- Overweight (-0.5)
- Right handed only (0.5)
- Overpriced (-0.5)

If you are a claw or palm position mouse holder, this one is probably a mixture of both. This because where your palm is going to rest depends on where you are going to position your thumb on the MMO keys. Unlike the Corsair Scimitar (which slides), the MMO buttons are locked in a fixed position.

Keymaps, its limited. Although you have up to 8 keymaps available, the physical button to keymap feature is flawed. Razer needs to let a button press cycle across the entire 8 keymaps instead of only going to one keymap. This forces you to use 8 buttons to get at each keymap (a waste). You are then forced to use Razer Synapse software to get to the right keymap.

Weight wise, this thing is a paper weight. They need a new design to reduce this by at least 20% with lighter materials. Realize this is not a normal mouse. It has stuff on it that makes it more heavier. This mouse is feels more heavier than my Corsair Scimitar Pro.

The biggest thing that I hate is that there is no nib sticking out on the 5 key. This is a critical mistake. All keyboards have nibs over the F and J keys for hand position. You need that nib to let you feel where the middle of the MMO grid is to avoid looking at the mouse.

In regards to lighting, its limited. You can't control each button color as all 12 buttons and the scroll wheel sync to the same color. Per button lighting can help you identify actions better by taking a quick glance at the grid. Staring at a grid full of the same color doesn't help at all - a useless feature. Use color to help in improving game play, that's what its for, not for aesthetics only. Also, there is no logo lighting - a missed brand opportunity.

For DPI sensitivity, this goes only up to 8200 DPI. Though most people don't use anything over 1600 for gaming, this is a minor issue but perhaps if you want to use it for desktop use at high settings across multi monitors, 8200 is all she goes.",three star follow reason good wirelesswir custom key bind abil creat profil activ batteri power monitor recharg cradl bad lack nib 5 key get sen finger posit 05 overweight 05 right hand 05 overpr 05 claw palm posit mous holder one probabl mixtur palm go rest depend go posit thumb mmo key unlik corsair scimitar slide mmo button lock fix posit keymap limit although 8 keymap avail physic button keymap featur flaw razer need let button press cycl across entir 8 keymap instead go one keymap forc use 8 button get keymap wast forc use razer synaps softwar get right keymap weight wise thing paper weight need new design reduc least 20 lighter materi realiz normal mous stuff make heavier mous feel heavier corsair scimitar pro biggest thing hate nib stick 5 key critic mistak keyboard nib f j key hand posit need nib let feel middl mmo grid avoid look mous regard light limit cant control button color 12 button scroll wheel sync,1512172800,3

50966,8626,4283,"3.5 stars for reasons below

I have the following mice to give a fair assessment of what I think of this Corsair Scimitar:
- Corsair Scimitar Pro
- Razer Naga Epic Chroma
- Logitech G600
- Zowie ZA12
- Logitech M510

Pros
- Lightweight
- Customized lighting in 4 zones
- Multi level DPI configuration levels w/on the fly switching
- Button grid that can be slid forward and back for better hand position
- Textured buttons with the 5 button with nib
- Braided cable

Cons
- Very much a palm mouse. If you claw, it may take a while to get used to
- My 4 button gets stuck at times spewing 4's across the screen. I have to wiggle it to make it stop. Very bad.
- Can only store 3 hardware profiles. This thing should be able to store a 100.
- Clicking the middle scroll wheel as a button is way too rigid. Imagine setting this to spacebar for jumping in a FPS. It too rough and should have more ""give"" to it.
- No lighting per button. Would be nice to distinguish rows for software purposes (i.e. editing, movement, building, fighting, etc.)
- Cue software UI sucks for setting up this mouse. As a new user, you are better off deleting all the Actions and starting from scratch to learn the UI.
- Top button next to mouse wheel is hard wired for profile switching. What if I wanted to use this for something else?
- Surface calibration feature doesn't work well. I get terrible lag when trying to drag and draw in a circular pattern that it makes me wonder if this is even calibrating right. This, at 1600 DPI setting on a Corsair XXL mat and fast Ryzen 1700X.

Improvements needed:
- Get rid of the metal plate. Its unnecessary baggage that adds to the weight of the mouse and cost. The lighter the better for less hand fatigue.
- Storing only 3 profiles is lame. Many of us play way more games and use many applications. Let us store at least 100 profiles by designing the mouse to use microSD to store the profiles on. When you click the profile button, it brings up a dialog box that lets us select which profile to use. You owe me Corsair for this idea.
- Cue software needs to not show panels that don't correlate to the present view. For example, why should the left panel of buttons that have nothing to do with the grid buttons be shown? Also don't show the G1-G10 panel when it has nothing to do with the present view. Stupid things like this clutter up the UI configuration and cause confusion. The lower panel also needs to be in sync with the present focus of the button.
- Way too long of a cable. I attach this to the back of my Corsair Strafe keyboard port and you won't believe how ugly this looks on the desk. Supply a short braided 3' cable and a 10' cable. I've also have too many USB connect/disconnect problems in this configuration.
- Ability to slide the grid back another 1/4"". People with small hands (even kids) have to go into claw mode instead of palm mode to get at these buttons. For example, I rest my palm on the mouse and my thumb is comfortably on the 5 key. The button grid is all the way slid back. However, when I need to reach for the 123 keys, I have to physically lift my hand off the mouse and reach for the 123. If I don't, I risk clicking on two keys (i.e. 1/4, 2/5, 3/6). This forces me to push my hand forward wasting valuable time, especially in FPS games.

One thing to consider that I noticed on all my MMO mouses is that if you have a need to lift the mouse off the mat, these devices are not ideal.  First, they are heavier than your typical gaming mouse like the Zowie EC. Over long play sessions, you develop hand fatigue. Second, you can accidentally click one of the buttons on the grid at an inopportune time, espeically while you are playing a fast FPS game. Lastly, finding a means to even grip onto something and lift is a problem - there's nothing to grab onto and feels way unstable. The design on this mouse is awkward. Along the right hand side there is a textured rubber grip region. But, my ring finger and pinky can't grip this and lift without feeling like I'm losing grip.

These types of mice are best suited for palm players with larger hands. More for your Warcraft, Dota, type of games rather than FPS.  If you are going to use this for FPS and play with low DPI and need to lift, good luck! More times than not I have felt that I lost the sense of grip and moved from palming, to clawing.",35 star reason follow mouse give fair ass think corsair scimitar corsair scimitar pro razer naga epic chroma logitech g600 zowi za12 logitech m510 pro lightweight custom light 4 zone multi level dpi configur level fli switch button grid slid forward back better hand posit textur button 5 button nib braid cabl con much palm mous claw may take get use 4 button get stuck time spew 4 across screen wiggl make stop bad store 3 hardwar profil thing abl store 100 click middl scroll wheel button way rigid imagin set spacebar jump fp rough give light per button would nice distinguish row softwar purpos ie edit movement build fight etc cue softwar ui suck set mous new user better delet action start scratch learn ui top button next mous wheel hard wire profil switch want use someth el surfac calibr featur doesnt work well get terribl lag tri drag draw circular pattern make wonder even calibr right 1600 dpi set corsair xxl mat fast ryzen 1700x improv need get rid metal plate unnecessari baggag add weight mous cost,1512259200,3

Say what you will say about its spazzy, kill-streak laden, twitch-fest game play, but that game had one of the best single player campaigns in the arena of first person shooters. The founders of Infinity Ward left Activision and opened their doors as Respawn, so the talent in this game is substantial.

The first Titanfall came up short in the SP campaign (as in it didn't have one). The SP campaign here manages to bring fresh ideas and mix in their exemplary cinematic flares, which provides a big jolt to the staid genre. The only fault with it is its briefness, but it sort of (not completely) makes up for it by having replayable value at more challenging difficulty levels.

The multiplayer is what it is, and hasn't changed much, so people familiar with this franchise shouldn't run into anything drastic.",call duti modern warfar 2 one alltim favorit shooter say say spazzi killstreak laden twitchfest game play game one best singl player campaign arena first person shooter founder infin ward left activis open door respawn talent game substanti first titanfal came short sp campaign didnt one sp campaign manag bring fresh idea mix exemplari cinemat flare provid big jolt staid genr fault brief sort complet make replay valu challeng difficulti level multiplay hasnt chang much peopl familiar franchis shouldnt run anyth drastic,1512345600,4

But most importantly they help you get your shot on target, quicker and smoother. The science behind KontrolFreek's pretty riveting itself. Anyone who is hesitant or just curious on these, it IS worth the try; You will NOT be disappointed. I love KontrolFreek's so much I've purchased them for 3 of my cousins and 1 friend as gifts and now they can't go back to the basic default thumb-stick. JUST TRY THEM, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

51031,9103,185,"I used to have the old mayflash adapter for PC in 2012 which only supported two controllers and SOME rumble compatibility, and didn't work for Smash. This one is much nicer in almost every aspect, including shape/size, build quality, and compatibility.

I bought this with the intention of testing ""Nintendont"" (a home brew application that works on the Virtual Wii side of WiiU that can play NGC titles via USB/SD) as the software declares working with the Nintendo adapter for the most recent Smash title. This one has a switch that allows the change between WiiU and PC modes, which I assume means the old one needed hardware to work on the console, which it did not.

I first tried this at a friends house with a copy of smash. Worked fine, no lag as we could tell, and no input errors/ghosting. Cord length is also well above average. Smash fans, rejoice. A cheaper and just as good option exists!

Second, I tried it with the homebrew software ""Nintendont"", seeing if it worked on the virtual version. I nearly inserted my actual GameCube disc since I was excited by the clean results in smash, which would have been bad (no, GameCube discs will not work and may damage your WiiU. Please do NOT try that.) The menu immediately picked up the controller like it did in the original Wii. I booted up the ISO for Kirby Air Ride and was met with excellent results. No input lag or ghosting. Now for the real precision test, I used F-Zero GX, notorious for being very sensetive to stick input and is highly customizable for dead zones, sensitivity, range, etc. I mapped the stick to the fullest and smallest ranges/zones I could and they were pixel perfect as with the Wii disc reader, and the good old GameCube itself. I was convinced at that point at how well it works.

Final testing was done with Dolphin for Windows. I was met with the same results using the same titles as it was on the WiiU. Finally, quality rumble support! I didn't have to map anything in the version I used as it already had a preset for a real GameCube pad. However, if your version doesn't pick up the pad on its own, make sure you map the triggers separately from the analog sliders to the click button when you press it all the way down. Otherwise games like Metroid Prime will have issues when locking and free aiming. To do this, go to the controller properties in devices and printers and look at the red icons lighting up to see what numbers they are.

In the end, I have to hand it to the developers at Mayflash. Product quality is definitely increasing at excellent prices. 5/5, I really cannot knock it for anything.",use old mayflash adapt pc 2012 support two control rumbl compat didnt work smash one much nicer almost everi aspect includ shape build qualiti compat bought intent test nintendont home brew applic work virtual wii side wiiu play ngc titl via usbsd softwar declar work nintendo adapt recent smash titl one switch allow chang wiiu pc mode assum mean old one need hardwar work consol first tri friend hous copi smash work fine lag could tell input errorsghost cord length also well averag smash fan rejoic cheaper good option exist second tri homebrew softwar nintendont see work virtual version nearli insert actual gamecub disc sinc excit clean result smash would bad gamecub disc work may damag wiiu plea tri menu immedi pick control like origin wii boot iso kirbi air ride met excel result input lag ghost real precis test use fzero gx notori senset stick input highli customiz dead zone sensit rang etc map stick fullest smallest rangeszon could pixel perfect wii disc reader,1512345600,5

It's a really great feeling mouse, but I had to dock it one star because the scroll wheel tends to squeak. I often play games with friends and they've complained about the sound the scroll wheel makes through our voice chat.
Besides that, the macro buttons are comfortably placed for my hand and I like the size and feel of it overall.
The software is only needed to change setting on the mouse as once they're set they seem to stay saved on the mouse and are instantly usable on another computer.

I probably wouldn't recommend this mouse. To save some people time, the main issue I have with this mouse is that after a month or two of use it stops tracking randomly at any time even in games and you either have to unplug it and plug it back in or wait 5-15 seconds for it to start working again. This appears to be an issue many people have had; I remember seeing reviews about it before I bought it and decided to take the risk. By comparison, I bought a Razer Deathadder Chroma on May 18, 2016 and haven't had any problems yet. My brother also bought a Deathadder Chroma on Oct. 20, 2016 and hasn't had problems yet. Although I love the Deathadder I think I'll be trying the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum to replace this Naga Hex V2 just to get some experience with another well known brand.
See below for a detailed comparison/review.

**This review will be mostly a comparison between the Razer Naga Hex V2 and the Razer Deathadder Chroma.**
I bought this mouse on July 12, 2017 on sale for $42.89 after tax and it looks like it's on sale for ~$45 now so this might be a good time to review it. I've been using it almost every day with my desktop PC for anywhere from 30 minutes to 6+ hours of constant movement and clicking. This includes simple tasks like spreadsheets, YouTube, Netflix etc. as well as more intense use like MOBA and FPS games. I bought it partially because it was on sale and partially because I needed a mouse for my laptop (I switched my Deathadder Chroma from my desktop to my laptop).
I'll start with the positives. This mouse looks great, and since I already had the software installed it was fairly quick to set up. It does of course have more options than the Deathadder, specifically in reference to the side buttons. The Deathadder is limited to 2 side buttons which I use to adjust DPI on the fly and I believe that's the default setting , but they can be changed. The Naga Hex V2 however puts these buttons behind the scroll wheel and adds an additional 7 side buttons that can be programmed to pretty much any combination of keys you can think of, I also like having a place to rest my thumb in the middle of the buttons. Both the Deathadder and the Naga Hex V2 allow you to change the colors.

Ok now for a few negatives (sort of). The first major difference I noticed when switching from the Deathadder to the Naga Hex V2 was that this mouse tends to promote more of a palm grip while the Deathadder seems to be better suited for a finger/claw grip. This made the Naga feel odd at first but I got used to it and it's perfectly comfortable even though my hands are fairly small for a guy; so in the end no issue there. The second problem I had was the organization of the 7 side buttons; looking at the side of the mouse directly, the keys go in order of 1, 2, 3, 7, 6, 5, 4 clockwise. Personally I found this made it harder to get used to the buttons but then again I've never been a big user of programmable mouse buttons so maybe more experienced users won't have a problem. Another thing I realized is that I prefer the DPI quick switching to be on the side for easier access so if you want that you'll have to program 2 of the side keys to do it. Oddly enough accidentally pressing the DPI buttons seems to happen to me the same amount regardless of whether I use the Naga or the Deathadder, but it's rare in both cases. These issues are negligible and I'd probably give this mouse 4 stars at the ~$80 or 5 stars at the ~$45 price if it wasn't for the tracking issue I mentioned at the start of this review.
Sorry for the long review, I hope this helped some people with their decision in buying a mouse.",dec 7th 2017 probabl wouldnt recommend mous save peopl time main issu mous month two use stop track randomli time even game either unplug plug back wait 515 second start work appear issu mani peopl rememb see review bought decid take risk comparison bought razer deathadd chroma may 18 2016 havent problem yet brother also bought deathadd chroma oct 20 2016 hasnt problem yet although love deathadd think ill tri logitech g502 proteu spectrum replac naga hex v2 get experi anoth well known brand see detail comparisonreview review mostli comparison razer naga hex v2 razer deathadd chroma bought mous juli 12 2017 sale 4289 tax look like sale 45 might good time review ive use almost everi day desktop pc anywher 30 minut 6 hour constant movement click includ simpl task like spreadsheet youtub netflix etc well intens use like moba fp game bought partial sale partial need mous laptop switch deathadd chroma desktop laptop ill start posit mous look great sinc alreadi,1512604800,3

Long story short, I would definitely recommend this mouse to a friend. My original review of this mouse shortly after buying it was 3 stars because the software was giving me problems. After realizing it was an issue with my PC I changed the review to 4 stars. Now after 1 year and 7 months of continuous use with no issues, I feel obligated to give this mouse 5 stars and re-write my review.

**Durability** Putting this first because it's the big reason I chose to give this 5 stars.
I bought this mouse on May 18, 2016. Since then I've used it daily on both my desktop PC and my laptop. I've used it for browsing, streaming movies, social media, and playing MOBA, FPS, and MMO games. Daily use varied from a few minutes browsing one day to multiple hours of intense gaming another day. I haven't encountered a single issue with tracking or clicking in 19 months of use and on top of that, the USB cord shows no signs of damage. When I got the Razer Naga Hex V2 for my desktop about 5 months ago I started using the Deathadder for my laptop and it's seen a fair bit of travel in those 5 months. I just wind the cord around the mouse and place it in my laptop bag. I've even dropped it a few times. On the other hand, in those 5 months the new Naga Hex V2 has had a continuing problem with the tracking randomly turning off while I'm using it, and it hasn't ever left my desk. At this point I wish I'd just bought another Deathadder.

**Comfort**
I tend to use a finger grip with this mouse but it seems to me that any style grip would be comfortable. I've also seen many people say it's a good mouse for large hands but I personally have small hands and really enjoy the feel of this mouse. I can't recall feeling any discomfort while using this mouse for extended periods of time (3-6 hrs).

**My Experience**
I'm no expert but in my experience this is my favorite mouse for gaming so far. The tracking is fluid and with options ranging all the way up to 10,000 DPI I've really been able to experiment and find my personal preference. I'm not sure anyone uses a DPI near 10,000 though. Personally I find that 1800 suites me well in most cases; but I have presets for 800, 2000, 2450, and 3000 also. So far this is my favorite gaming mouse but honestly I haven't tried too many. Others I have tried include the Razer Naga Hex V2, the Gigabyte GM-M6900, and a few off-brands; none of which I would recommend. In a few days I'm replacing my Naga Hex V2 with a Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum which I have high hopes for.

51133,8,207,"Reviewing on Dec. 7, 2017
Images attached are recent (after 19 months of continuous use)
Long story short, I would definitely recommend this mouse to a friend. My original review of this mouse shortly after buying it was 3 stars because the software was giving me problems. After realizing it was an issue with my PC I changed the review to 4 stars. Now after 1 year and 7 months of continuous use with no issues, I feel obligated to give this mouse 5 stars and re-write my review.

**Durability** Putting this first because it's the big reason I chose to give this 5 stars.
I bought this mouse on May 18, 2016. Since then I've used it daily on both my desktop PC and my laptop. I've used it for browsing, streaming movies, social media, and playing MOBA, FPS, and MMO games. Daily use varied from a few minutes browsing one day to multiple hours of intense gaming another day. I haven't encountered a single issue with tracking or clicking in 19 months of use and on top of that, the USB cord shows no signs of damage. When I got the Razer Naga Hex V2 for my desktop about 5 months ago I started using the Deathadder for my laptop and it's seen a fair bit of travel in those 5 months. I just wind the cord around the mouse and place it in my laptop bag. I've even dropped it a few times. On the other hand, in those 5 months the new Naga Hex V2 has had a continuing problem with the tracking randomly turning off while I'm using it, and it hasn't ever left my desk. At this point I wish I'd just bought another Deathadder.

**Comfort**
I tend to use a finger grip with this mouse but it seems to me that any style grip would be comfortable. I've also seen many people say it's a good mouse for large hands but I personally have small hands and really enjoy the feel of this mouse. I can't recall feeling any discomfort while using this mouse for extended periods of time (3-6 hrs).

**My Experience**
I'm no expert but in my experience this is my favorite mouse for gaming so far. The tracking is fluid and with options ranging all the way up to 10,000 DPI I've really been able to experiment and find my personal preference. I'm not sure anyone uses a DPI near 10,000 though. Personally I find that 1800 suites me well in most cases; but I have presets for 800, 2000, 2450, and 3000 also. So far this is my favorite gaming mouse but honestly I haven't tried too many. Others I have tried include the Razer Naga Hex V2, the Gigabyte GM-M6900, and a few off-brands; none of which I would recommend. In a few days I'm replacing my Naga Hex V2 with a Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum which I have high hopes for. I considered getting another Deathadder Chroma but they were out of stock.",review dec 7 2017 imag attach recent 19 month continu use long stori short would definit recommend mous friend origin review mous shortli buy 3 star softwar give problem realiz issu pc chang review 4 star 1 year 7 month continu use issu feel oblig give mous 5 star rewrit review durabl put first big reason chose give 5 star bought mous may 18 2016 sinc ive use daili desktop pc laptop ive use brow stream movi social medium play moba fp mmo game daili use vari minut brow one day multipl hour intens game anoth day havent encount singl issu track click 19 month use top usb cord show sign damag got razer naga hex v2 desktop 5 month ago start use deathadd laptop seen fair bit travel 5 month wind cord around mous place laptop bag ive even drop time hand 5 month new naga hex v2 continu problem track randomli turn im use hasnt ever left desk point wish id bought anoth deathadd comfort tend use finger grip,1512604800,5

51166,7281,1430,"If I could give it a 4.5, I would, but alas, Amazon insists on keeping whole stars.  Regardless, this game truly blew it out of the water at the time.  I fondly look back on playing it in high school and remembering how people who never played games, mostly girls (as I, too, am female), started to get into gaming BECAUSE this game was dictated towards younger, less mature audiences.  And, hell, there's Disney characters in it!

The game itself is kind of genius.  To combine Squaresoft's popular Final Fantasy characters, new characters of their own such as Sora, Riku (a young Sephiroth look-alike), and Kairi, while ALSO blending in Disney characters seemed destined for failure, but it worked and worked well!  Us gamers were overjoyed to see familiar faces, while us Disney dorks jumped for joy upon revisiting our childhood favorites.

The story is centered around a Keyblade master.  The Keyblade has chose Sora, our main character, to wield the Keyblade and either save or destroy many worlds.  The problem is that some arch-nemesis has begun to let the Darkness and the Heartless seep out into the many worlds of the stars and destroy them.  Stars are winking out.  Whole worlds are disappearing.  Donald and Goofy, two of the more popular Disney characters of all time, join forces with Sora to not only seek out King Mickey, who is attempting to stop the Heartless, while Sora looks for his friends Riku and Kairi after their world disappears.  The company must travel from world to world to defeat the Heartless, and seal it with the Keyblade so that the world can be threatened no more.

Each world with the exception of Traverse Town, the first world Sora ends up in, and Destiny Islands, Sora's home world, are Disney worlds.  A main gripe is that some of the worlds aren't really what you're going to be expecting.  For example, Neverland is hardly Neverland.  It's literally Captain Hook's ship and the Clocktower, which, by the way, is in London...not Neverland.  The Coliseum, for Herclues' world is just that, a Coliseum, but I do like that there are tournaments you can take part of there so it's forgivable.  Understandably, the developers were doing something never done before with a huge blending of games and universes in order to create Kingdom Hearts, and so some of these worlds were not that developed.

Another gripe is that the controls can, at times, be annoying.  Jumping onto things is about as erratic as a seizure and many hours were spent overshooting or undershooting targets.  While battling, the controls to heal or cast magics can be infuriating as well since it takes a half of a second for an item or a spell to take effect and that can make all of the distance.  Why does Sora have to stand still to cast a spell?  I just don't get it.  BAM!! Sora's dead 'cause he stood still while some nasty boss came flying out of nowhere.

However, this all aside, the game is brilliant.  The abilities that are gained, the side-quests, the amount of time spent completing side quests and leveling up are all just so seamless and well thought-out.  Summons are a lot of fun, too, since they are Disney characters, too.  Though almost all of them are from worlds you don't visit.

The game is easily for all ages.  It can be a little hokey for grown adults who aren't into Final Fantasy and Disney, but for kids it's great and for anyone that's into those two categories they'll love to play this.

It's simply a story about not giving up and following your heart and believing in yourself while having fun along the way.

The RGB coloring is subtle but pleasant. Most importantly, the software that lets you set up macros seems lightweight and intuitive to use, though I haven't done anything more than the most basic setup.

My first run through the campaign was honestly a nightmare. I thought the combat was clunky, and the zombies were too strong.

Where as WW2 makes you grind for hours before you get something useful, unless of course you start buying Loot Boxes, which is why they make you grind for sooo long. Like I said, Im over 20 hours in WW2 and I still don't have the BAR and every other assault rifle is garbage by comparison.

The maps in WW2 are also terrible. You spawn on live grenades, there are 3 to 5 lines of sight to check at all times, check the wrong one first and your done. BOps 2 keeps it to 2 to 3 lines of sight, much more manageable.

So, to summarize, if you like grinding and/or paying money for weapons, you like garbage guns, and being shot in the back non stop, play WW2. If you like great weapons given at a reasonable pace, and logical maps, keep playing BOps2. Honestly, Sledgehammer just makes terrible COD games.

51272,1879,4483,"Before we dig too deep into the game, this game is worth owning for any Southpark fan. Despite some hiccups, it's genuinely fun.

Game play is where this title shines the brightest, as the RPG system is much improved over the original Stick of Truth. The combat is much more three dimensional, and the builds in this game have a lot more variety. Additionally, the game allows you to place your players on the board, allowing some moves to hit more enemies  or hit enemies into other enemies or obstacles. It adds a layer of depth rare in most RPGs.

The issue is this is a Southpark game, so you come for the comedy and the satire. This is where the game kinda falls on its face. I'd go so far as to say the funniest thing about The Fractured But Whole is the episode tie-in ""Franchise Prequel.""

The issue is the satire is lazy in many places and feels like it was left unfinished. It lacks the bite and attitude of the show, which frequently disregards political correctness under the philosophy ""nothing is above being made fun of."" Don't get me wrong, this story is not politically correct; moreso that I was left constantly wondering if a joke had to be left out due to Ubisoft. The Southpark team, rather than rewrite, just leaves the setup in without the punchline.

Not only that, but there are several encounters that felt like they were added on a storyboard, but the team forgot to add the connecting pieces, so it feels arbitrary.

At the end of the day, this is a good game. The writing holds it back from being a great one.",dig deep game game worth own southpark fan despit hiccup genuin fun game play titl shine brightest rpg system much improv origin stick truth combat much three dimension build game lot varieti addit game allow place player board allow move hit enemi hit enemi enemi obstacl add layer depth rare rpg issu southpark game come comedi satir game kinda fall face id go far say funniest thing fractur whole episod tiein franchis prequel issu satir lazi mani place feel like left unfinish lack bite attitud show frequent disregard polit correct philosophi noth made fun dont get wrong stori polit correct moreso left constantli wonder joke left due ubisoft southpark team rather rewrit leav setup without punchlin sever encount felt like ad storyboard team forgot add connect piec feel arbitrari end day good game write hold back great one,1512864000,3

Well I bought this game and one of the selling points was the ""visuals"", they must mean compared to the original release because the game is hideous (not in a cool, creepy way, I mean ugly). 1080p is wasted on this game. The graphics being bad wouldn't be to bad though (I'm old and remember when resident evil 1 was cutting edge) but the dialogue and story are REALLY bad. Then you get to the controls, OMFG. Talk about annoying, I've played other resident evil games made for 1 stick (mercanaries on 3ds for example) but after playing a bit you get a feel for it. This game isn't like that (for me atleast). IMO if Capcom wasn't going to put anymore into this port than they did they should have skipped it, even at 20 bones this game isn't worth the money. My advice is if you want a survival horror game for 20 for the ps4 I would get res 5 or 6. I'm not a big fan of the action resident evil games but they are WAY better than this game.

Fractured but Whole is a continuation of the original Stick of Truth game. My copy of the sequel also included a coupon to download the original game free of charge. Here are my thoughts on this sequel:

This feels like three different experiences. The first is an animated story told through sometimes lengthy cut scenes that are every bit as good as something you might see on Comedy Central. Animation is excellent and all of the familiar voices and humor are here. The second component reminds of the old ""point and click"" adventures from my PC gaming days with free reign to explore environments with your character collecting items. The third aspect is the turn based combat system that will feel familiar to fans of role playing games. The twist here is the excellent animation and filthy humor.

51454,4871,3938,"As an early 360 launch title this game has not aged well.  Still worth a few bucks if you can find it cheap in 2017.

Graphics are so-so (but art direction is strong), framerate starts off fine but gets choppy in the later levels.  Story is trash.  Dialogue is funny (except for Jack Dark).  Enemies say funny things when you shoot them like in the original.  Soundtrack is awesome, might be best part of the game.  It is actually worth purchasing separately.

The shooting mechanics are seriously flawed.  As mentioned above, framerates are choppy on later levels.  There is plenty of screen tear.  The cover system does not work nearly as well as in game like Gears of War.  The way the right stick handles aiming is bad.  It responds sluggishly and makes aiming harder than it should be.  Often when you are in cover and targeting an enemy the targeting moves when actually taking the shot.  Also, there is some kind of artificial difficulty where the enemies often move when you place the aiming cursor on them, even when they can't see you.  Another thing about the cover system is that sometimes you are hit by enemy fire despite being in cover.  That should not happen.

The escort missions are terrible, just terrible.  Computer controlled allies get themselves killed and you lose the level.  They also get in your way and you end up shooting them (and yes you do damage and can accidentally kill allies).

The checkpoint system is awful on the higher difficulties.  Do NOT try these levels unless you are a masochist.  It becomes a matter of memorizing levels and enemy locations rather than a test of skills.  Especially the Jungle mission.

Ending on a positive note, the game has tons of multiplayer options and coop (both local and Xbox live).  So, 2 stars for the single player, and add a star due to the variety of multiplayer modes.",earli 360 launch titl game age well still worth buck find cheap 2017 graphic soso art direct strong framer start fine get choppi later level stori trash dialogu funni except jack dark enemi say funni thing shoot like origin soundtrack awesom might best part game actual worth purchas separ shoot mechan serious flaw mention framer choppi later level plenti screen tear cover system work nearli well game like gear war way right stick handl aim bad respond sluggishli make aim harder often cover target enemi target move actual take shot also kind artifici difficulti enemi often move place aim cursor even cant see anoth thing cover system sometim hit enemi fire despit cover happen escort mission terribl terribl comput control alli get kill lose level also get way end shoot ye damag accident kill alli checkpoint system aw higher difficulti tri level unless masochist becom matter memor level enemi locat rather test skill especi jungl mission end posit note game ton multiplay option coop,1513209600,3

51478,8,75,"I've only had this mouse for a few days so I'll be coming back to update this review if need be.
This is a great looking mouse, and the weight and construction feels like solid quality.  I bought it to replace my Razer Naga Hex V2 because the tracker on the Naga kept failing randomly after only a few months. So far it's great, the software is fairly straightforward and I like the button placement. The cord seems strong and durable and has plenty of length. I experimented a little and found that I prefer the natural weight of the mouse without any of the extra weights since I tend to pick my mouse up slightly quite often during games. The buttons can be programmed to pretty much anything but I'm so used to using keyboard commands that I have trouble remembering to use my mouse shortcuts sometimes, even after using the Naga with it's buttons. The mouse buttons themselves are nice and clicky but not too loud. The scroll wheel is different, I'm definitely used to a rubber wheel. It's nice that you can use free scroll for things like looking through a long document or lock the wheel for times when you need the distinct click (like when you are switching weapons in a game). The wheel takes a little getting used to but it started feeling normal to me after a few uses.

The only thing I dislike about the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum is that it feels very thin in comparison to the other mice I've tried (Razer Deathadder Chroma and Razer Naga Hex V2). It feels odd to say a mouse feels too small since I have small hands for a guy, being only 5'6"" tall. This may just be because I was so used to the Naga. It seems that Logitech intentionally slimmed down this mouse from older models; it looks nice but my ring and pinky finger have nowhere to rest. It felt weird at first but I've kind of gotten used to it, however I've noticed I tend to feel discomfort after extended use. The Razer Naga Hex V2 was a disappointment when it came to the tracking but I will say it had an excellent ergonomic design. Which is funny because when I first bought that mouse I thought the extra finger rest on the right side made it look weird but now I feel like the only thing missing from the G502 is that extra resting space. I decided to give it 5 stars anyway.

As a side note; after buying this mouse and using it for about a week with my desktop I decided to buy the Logitech G602 as well for my laptop because having a wired mouse with my laptop has been frustrating at times, especially when using it on my office desk. I'm limited in space and the mouse cord gets caught in the phone cord pretty often.",ive mous day ill come back updat review need great look mous weight construct feel like solid qualiti bought replac razer naga hex v2 tracker naga kept fail randomli month far great softwar fairli straightforward like button placement cord seem strong durabl plenti length experi littl found prefer natur weight mous without extra weight sinc tend pick mous slightli quit often game button program pretti much anyth im use use keyboard command troubl rememb use mous shortcut sometim even use naga button mous button nice clicki loud scroll wheel differ im definit use rubber wheel nice use free scroll thing like look long document lock wheel time need distinct click like switch weapon game wheel take littl get use start feel normal use thing dislik logitech g502 proteu spectrum feel thin comparison mouse ive tri razer deathadd chroma razer naga hex v2 feel odd say mous feel small sinc small hand guy 56 tall may use,1513296000,5

51525,2036,4332,"Just as Shakespeare wrote plays of genius masquerading as entertainment for the masses, so Yoko Taro has crafted an epic work of genius under the guise of ""just another action hack and slash"". After having played through 45 hours and having seen all five of the main endings (and having my save file deleted by the game...wait, what?!), I am here to tell you that there are going to need to publish new editions of ""1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die"", because this is one of the greatest games ever made. Yeah, yeah, overblown hyped-up hyperbole much? Well this game sold all of what, 2 million copies in a YEAR, when say, Horizon Zero Dawn sold more than that in about a MONTH. So yes, my ridiculous yelling about how good this game is, is COMPLETELY justified. So then, on to the review!

Not Synesthesia, but Something New

First of all, this is an action game, but unlike any you have ever played. As a 30 minute YouTube review noted (SkillUp if you want to check it out), this game not only switches from third-person action game (Kingdom Hearts) to top-down shooter (Ikaruga), to Twin Stick shooter (Enter the Gungeon), to Geometry-Based Twin Stick shooter (Geometry Wars), to side-scrolling shooter (Contra), it also switches SEAMLESSLY between them. There's no load screen. The camera simply shifts or fades out and the controls stay the same. Combine that with a soundtrack that also switches seamlessly between 8-bit and orchestral versions, and quiet and dynamic versions (with and without vocals!) to adjust to what is happening, and you have something completely new in games. You have a game that changes the sights and sounds dynamically on-the-fly in tandem so that the visuals and audio are always expressing exactly the same emotion based on what you do. This is similar in concept to the game Rez, where your actions to destroy enemies make different sounds depending on what you do, but that game (while awesome), only performs on rails in 3D, and features one version of a song that you riff off of. Nier's audio/visual experience is a whole other beast entirely.

A Circus Act Desperate For Your Applause

The same YouTube review likened the pacing and theatrics of Nier:Automata to a street performer constantly having to surprise you and top what they just showed you to hold your attention and get you part with your hard-earned cash, and he's not wrong. The first act of this three act (or three play-through, if you will) game ought to make you says ""Wow!"" quite a few times. I know that I was consistently surprised, shocked, amazed, and delighted in those first 15 hours. The tutorial level shocked me by KILLING ME(!), granting me an achievement for dying (!!), and allowing me to find my own corpse and grab the items I had lost (!!!). Once you get past that tutorial (don't give up! the game is teaching you how to play, I promise!), you are in for a roller-coaster of a ride. You'll have many ""What the heck?!"" moments followed by some of the most intense boss battles you've ever seen. The structure is, again, like Kingdom Hearts. You head somewhere, a cut-scene kicks in, you have somewhere to go, or something to do, you fight Machines along the way, encounter bosses, get new items, equip them, and unlock new places to go, etc. It's just that this core gameplay is taken to it's adult limit in terms of the unexpected and awesome. You have plugin chips that radically alter how you fight and heal, but they also can take away elements of the UI if removed (or even kill you!), you have many equitable weapons for both close range and long range attacks, and this means if you aren't enjoying the game you need to alter your combat style and equipment to reflect your personal taste and the situation at hand. Brilliant.

More Than the Sum of It's Flaws

Many people who don't like this game complain about it's flawed mechanics/execution. It's open-world, but there's invisible walls where you can't go. Your attacks don't evolve as you level up and the combat is repetitive. The game varies from too easy to too hard. There isn't enough character development. The plot isn't explained obviously enough/doesn't make sense. They don't like replaying the first campaign a second time. Well...

I agree with others who have stated a 10 out of 10 doesn't have to be about perfection of mechanics and execution. It can be about being revolutionary in concept, and in a competent execution of said revolutionary concept. This game is not PERFECT. It has flaws and weaknesses. But it's 4th-wall-shattering revolutionary execution of it's concepts is so groundbreaking that the flaws just don't matter if you get what the game's creator was trying to make you experience.

The Music

A lot of people have talked about the music of this game so I'll be brief. Not only is the music amazing but it dynamically changes in response to what you are doing in the game. You need to play the game to understand what I'm talking about but suffice it to say that you need to both play the game and listen to the score on its own to fully appreciate it, because it really is THAT good. Just when you think you're starting to get tired of it and think you'll soon never want to hear it again, it gets stuck in your head and haunts your dreams.

The Plot, The Emotion, A Desolation That Leads to Joy

The first play-through of 15 hours is a shock-and-awe masterpiece of Grade A Action Movie Awesome. It tells a complete story, it's fun, it's fulfilling. But it's pretty obvious by the end that you known NOTHING about what's really going on. The second playthrough introduces a new hacking mechanic which is/can be used so often that many get tired of it. That said, it is certainly interesting, and adds, along with the new cut-scenes, a completely new dimension to the second playthrough. The second playthrough also grants you a new perspective, and has a HUGE revelation to the plot at the end that you probably saw coming a hundred miles away. Even so, it definitely adds to the game.

The third playthrough takes everything you have seen up to this point and dials it up to 11. You gain ANOTHER completely new perspective, everything you known and love is completely destroyed, and you'll likely find yourself yelling at your TV along with the protagonists ""WHAT IS GOING ON!?!?!?"" It's not as ""fun"" as the first play-through, and the big shockers are in the plot, not in the gameplay, so in a sense it's not as ""good"" as the first play-through. That said, it carries the majority of the emotional weight of the game, and let's you play as my favorite character (and it's the second half of the story), so if you want to see the entire story I think it would be absolute madness to give up after beating only the first play-through as 2B. But hey, you paid for it, do whatever you want...

The overall plot has elements of everything from Shakespeare (yes, the themes of his plays are buried in there, and even the character names are references), to The Matrix, Battlestar Galactica, and every dystopian futuristic anime you can think of (and the bible, for good measure). The character development is subtle, and if you like your plot points and character development anvil-dropped on your head you may miss the subtleties. A clenched-fist and mysterious quiet musing here echoes across multiple breakthroughs. I for one love anime stoic/heroic action girls (my fav anime archetype) so I loved 2B and A2 to death. 9S is something else but he's definitely a completely different character in the second half from the first and far less of a one-note performance than your first play-through might make you think.

ALL of the voice actors who worked on this game deserve accolades. There was ample opportunity to cheese-it-up on this game, but every voice actor in the English dub gave a heartfelt nuanced performance (superb direction of the voice acting). Easily on par with a major motion picture with the top tier of actors. And the writing of both the spoken and written dialog (didn't I mention it? how stupid of me. there's written story that's just as good and sometimes better than the cut-scenes, just so you have even MORE types of gameplay experience to draw upon for the story(!)), is absolutely superb in its translation.

If, like I was, you are feeling depressed after beating all three campaigns but have yet to play the ""true"" ending that comes after seeing both sides of the final battle, I advise you to keep going and see the final, final, FINAL conclusion of the game. Because believe it or not, the END CREDITS SEQUENCE is what is going to make this one of the greatest games you have ever played. Or...I don't know. Maybe not if you're really cynical I guess.

In The End

Never has a game made me cry like this. Never has a game shocked me like this. Never has a game made this depressed, or this happy. Never has a game made me yell ""Wow!"" so often or so loudly. Never has a game made me say ""Oh my god!"" so often and so loudly (especially in the first 20 minutes of the third play-through). And never, NEVER has a game made me yell at the screen in hopeful joyous triumph like the true ending of this game did.

If that's not enough to make you play it all the way to the fifth ending I don't know what will. And if the game's creator should ever happen to read my review I just want to say...

3) It's contours are made just right and feels good to hold

51590,424,3775,"Paper Mario Color Splash really took me by surprise. Thousand Year Door for GameCube was one of my all time favorite titles and I was hoping for something similar to that after the somewhat lackluster Paper Mario for Wii. This game actually did that for me.

This is the first HD Paper Mario ever and its absolutely stunning. Sometimes I just walk around gazing at its beauty! Its all handcrafted with legitimate care and consideration. The art design is out of this world, with sharp and precise paper cut-outs for every level that burst with color. That may be the biggest draw.

The music is something else I adore about the game, as its lovely and calming to listen to. For battles, things are taken up a notch and the music is great there as well. There isn't really voice acting but that leads me into the next section.

One of this games biggest accomplishment is the writing and witty dialogue between characters. The shy guys, toads and the rest of the cast are hilarious, even Marios trusty paint bucket, Huey. There is always a smile on my face while playing because of these funny and adorable characters and the things they have to say.

The gameplay is also excellent and unique. The game utilizes a card battle system in which you must choose a card to play, paint the card, flick the card then the action unfolds. In true Paper Mario fashion, you must then time the attacks and blocks perfectly to get their full effect. I personally love this battle system, but many may find it cumbersome and annoying. There is an overworld map of the land of Prism, and it plays like any other Mario title. There are various levels and areas you must complete to advance. Here, you must paint each level back to its original state, from Black & White. Its a fun challenge to 100% every level.

Color Splash is a gorgeous and memorable adventure that really does feel like an adventure. With fun levels, unique gameplay, hilarious writing, memorable moments, great music and good replay value, Color Splash is a true gem and a must-own for the Wii U. This is one of the last Wii U games to ever have been released. I guess they saved the best for last.

51625,2050,879,"I was in the market for a second pair of headphones in the style of closed back this time around. I already had some great pair of open back headphones already. But I needed something that was closed back and cheap.

I looked around for a while before I settled on the logitech G430, that I was able to get cheap. I was curious about how well the headset would do, along with the fact it's USB audio dongle supported DTS Headphone X. Beside supporting DTS HP X, it also supported Dolby headphone, which I already heard before on the past. My main focus was the latter. Some people might be put off by having to use the logitech software to have access to both Dolby headphone and DTS HP X, for me that not a hassle, as used the software before hand with mice and didn't have an issue, but not every one con-fig is the same.

I found the volume controls on the cable to be very useful, since I won't have to control the volume from the usb sound device it self. Which also handy if you are using a sound card, that way you don't have to fool with the volume on that either. The control box is in a good spot and is easy to get to, even have a clip so you can place it on your shirt or pants. The one thing I did not like about the cable it self, was the quality of the cable, It looks like it could be easy to break if your not careful. A thicker cable would had been a better choice, since the cable is not removable, the rotating mic is nice touch, but being removable would had been better. Since even when you move it upwards, it still in the way.

The Ear pads are comfortable even with glasses on, but it even more comfortable with them off. The pads are removable and easy to clean. So that's a very good thing to be-able to do. Sadly the headband pad can't be removed, but you can still clean it, you just have to wipe it down to do so.

Surround Modes

By default it is set to DTS 7.1 and Super Stereo front  mode but there is also an option for stereo wide. But it gives you option for First Person Shooter and logitech Signature studio. Some games I found my self prefer using stereo front, others Stereo wide. For movies I always preferred to use Stereo wide because it makes the movies feel open like its.

In games DTS 7.1 boosted the bass which was good in some games, while other it made the bass sub-woofer like, Which I do not enjoy. I found my self loving Logitech Signature studio the most out of the 3 room's type.  In this setting, every thing sound natural, at the same time while it could be heard cleanly the highs where too clean, When I tried the FPS mode, I didn't like it as it sounded off. Although the bass was much better then the other modes it was lower then the other modes. But I it did not bother me in games.  Movies on the other hand, It didn't do a good job. That's where DTS 7.1 mode work the best, Movies came alive and I really felt like I was in the movie. But there was a down side, the volume had to be turned up whenever I watched a movie or stream TV shows, there was some games that also had the issue.

Music wise turning off the surround was the best option, with it turned off, the G430 does a very good job in stereo mode with music. Better then what I thought it would do. I would say the sound signature was neutral to my ears. The bass was good and was not muddy like cheaper closed back headphones I used in the past over all enjoyable.

Conclusion
Over all while the G430 comes with an USB sound card, I plugging it into my sound blaster AE-5 gave better results, include being able to get the correct volume in game that had the issue and able hear voices clearer and at the right volume when ever I watched a movie. While I did enjoy using DTS Headphone X, that's really the only thing I enjoyed using on the USB sound card.  So over all you would be better off plugging it into something else, instead of using that included USB sound card to get the most out of the G430s.",market second pair headphon style close back time around alreadi great pair open back headphon alreadi need someth close back cheap look around settl logitech g430 abl get cheap curiou well headset would along fact usb audio dongl support dt headphon x besid support dt hp x also support dolbi headphon alreadi heard past main focu latter peopl might put use logitech softwar access dolbi headphon dt hp x hassl use softwar hand mouse didnt issu everi one config found volum control cabl use sinc wont control volum usb sound devic self also handi use sound card way dont fool volum either control box good spot easi get even clip place shirt pant one thing like cabl self qualiti cabl look like could easi break care thicker cabl would better choic sinc cabl remov rotat mic nice touch remov would better sinc even move,1513555200,4

1) DPI can only be set in 250 intervals unlike the G502 which can be more specific. Not huge but I prefer 1800DPI and have to use 1750 with this mouse. Only mentioning it because some people really like to use specific DPI settings.
2) The programmable buttons are limited to the preset list of options. Copy, Paste, Cut, etc. or specific keyboard keys such as Enter or Delete; you cant set commands such as Shift+Q or Fn+f8... makes the side buttons pretty useless for me honestly. The G502 can be set to pretty much anything so this really surprised me. I took some pictures to show a size/style comparrison between the G502 and G602 for those interested.

After using it a bit more I feel I should add that this mouse has some real weight to it. Being a primarily wired mouse user I guess I'm not used to the added weight of the batteries.

51697,7495,4320,"When I bought this game, I didn't know much about it. I knew that it was about a girl and some robots and had an open world. I talked myself out of buying it several times because of the robot thing. I gave in when I kept seeing all the rave reviews.

When I first stared playing it, I thought, ""Oh my gosh, they have created a game like the Witcher!!!"" It's not. It kind of reminds me Assassins Creed gameplay.

I'm going to give you a list of pros and cons from my perspective.

Pros
1. The graphics and design... just beautiful
2. The female character is great. She's pretty but not beautiful. She tough and stubborn but  compassionate. I like her voice.
3. Combat is good
4. Ability to override the machines.
5. Has a unique story
6. Controls are easy to learn and map is easy to navigate. (Do yourself a favor and buy the ""forever travel bag""

Cons
1. I wish there were relationships in this story. Not necessarily romance, but something. Rost is the only one I felt any emotion towards. I feel like I need to care about someone in a game like this one. Most of the characters you meet in the game are forgettable. They feel more like robots than the actual robots.
2. Most of the side quests are just as forgettable as the people you will have to do them for. I wish they connected to the story line and not just there to get boost xp or to get supplies.

If I had to compare this to ""The Witcher"", I would give it 4 stars. There isn't a game that can top that game, in my opinion. However, I'm giving it 5 stars because it is it's own game, and it's a good one if you can get past its flaws.",bought game didnt know much knew girl robot open world talk buy sever time robot thing gave kept see rave review first stare play thought oh gosh creat game like witcher kind remind assassin creed gameplay im go give list pro con perspect pro 1 graphic design beauti 2 femal charact great she pretti beauti tough stubborn compassion like voic 3 combat good 4 abil overrid machin 5 uniqu stori 6 control easi learn map easi navig favor buy forev travel bag con 1 wish relationship stori necessarili romanc someth rost one felt emot toward feel like need care someon game like one charact meet game forgett feel like robot actual robot 2 side quest forgett peopl wish connect stori line get boost xp get suppli compar witcher would give 4 star isnt game top game opinion howev im give 5 star game,1513728000,5

I had used this on mostly sandbox games like Witcher 3 and occasionally used it while playing Destiny 2. This feels like there is no lag at all between the controller and the adapter to the game. If you already have an XB1 controller and want to play PC games, this adapter will help a lot, it does what it is advertised for and this has made my experience good.

Highlights:
- Can connect current XBOX One controllers
- Effort to connect is minimal:
--- 1) Plug in Adapter & press Connecting button
--- 2) Power on XB1 controller
--- 3) Press wireless connecter button on controller
--- 4) Once solid light on Xbox logo, you can use it!

I'll give you the rundown on just about every scene you'll encounter: ""Hey, that's what we need, way over there! We'll have to figure out how to get to it"" Then it's climb, climb, climb. Oh, hey there's a place you needed to solve a puzzle (that nobody would ever take the time to make) just to get into, and turns out there's a group of bad guys. Climb, shoot a few bad guys. Climb some more. Oh, and then a cut scene where everything breaks and you're way high up and Nate almost falls to his death but hangs on with one arm, and then gameplay resumes and you have to climb back up. After about 20 times of that, it loses its impact.

The story was a bit weak. It was more about the relationship between Nate and his brother (who was never even mentioned, at all, until this game, and now is a core character) and of course you have the obligatory tough female character in Nadine who is shoe horned into every movie and game these days.

In addition to the constant climbing, and I mean constant. If you play this, look at the end of the game, at your statistics, and compare the distance ran, time spent running, swimming, and climbing. You do so much climbing in this game it's ridiculous. And then there are WAY too many sections where you either give a boost to your companion, or it's too high and you have to drag a box over and jump on it (like in The Last of Us)

The AI is painfully stupid. The ""stealth"" elements are incredibly weak and you can literally jump and land right next to an enemy and they won't notice you. However, if you're hiding and throw a grenade or something anywhere in the area, they'll all immediately know exactly where you are.

While your thumb doesn't go below the mouse it rests in a comfortable alcove with a grippy rubber (also where your ring and pinky fingers are) so it's both comfortable and easy to grip, and pick up to reposition.

The thumb tip button while easy to push will never be misclicked, honestly if you never wanted to use it you'll forget it's there but the dpi shift is great for hyper accurate moments, like sniping.

The pointer finger has an indentation adding again to the comfort.  The mouse is smaller in general on the palm resting area, picture reaching for a door knob, that's about the position your hand will be in with this mouse.

The logitech software that controls there equipment is very easy to use.  It auto loads the mouse and you can click to customize any of the buttons or DPI settings including 3 profiles.

51829,734,4480,"*Updated Review as of 12/22/17

Not hyperbole at all, and no, I""m not even a super fan of the series. I generally skip every other GT because I feel it's more of the same. GT1, GT3, GT5 and now GTS are in my collection. I can honestly say, especially after the update, this is already the best GT game and will continue to get better. The one line reviews about it's cons are really doing a disservice to the great work PD has done.

Cons
- Needs to save your overall progress in the game offline, this can be annoying to people with shoddy, internet it's to deter cheaters in Sport Mode
- Not quite there with commercial everyday cars we love yet, DLC keeps adding new ones, but it'll be a while before we hit 300-400 cars
- PSVR mode is very limited
- That's it!!

Pros
- Best handling racing game on consoles (do yourself a favor a get a wheel, it's amazing!)
- Best online racing on consoles (the system rewards driving clean and fair, it's not about winning)
- One of the most impressive graphical showpieces for a 4K display
- December update added what we all missed from GT, Sunday Cups! And they will keep updating with more races
- Scapes and Livery editor are welcome editions that add a lot of customization and personality to your cars
- So far, all the DLC (Modes/Cars/Tracks) are free!

Really, PD announced this at launch, the game is a service, and will constantly be updated over time. I get that some folks might have been disappointing at launch, but only a month later, and they've already added a substantial single player experience, not to mention the initial campaign was already a good 15-20 hours of SP modes that actually taught you how to drive and gifted you with cars the more gold medals you got. I've had the game since launch and I've only played a tiny bit of MP because I want to collect Golds on everything. The game has been on sale throughout the Holiday period and is absolutely a steal at $35 and $40! The racing feels so good, and it's the first experience I've had online where everyone is purposely not trying to bump into you and race cleanly. In fact, in higher levels, racing online feels like racing against good AI, because other players don't want there precious driving rating affected, they don't ram you, or slow down on purpose in front of you, none of that usual online mess. But hey, even if you are too afraid of Sport mode, the regular content is here for you to dig into, and it's never looked, felt, and SOUNDED better. Finally a GT game with good sounds lol.

51847,324,4205,"Big Review Incoming!
Total Time in Use: 1 Week

Background: I own a lot of mice. My go-to is the Logitech G403, but lately I've been hankering for something with more than 6 buttons. Typically I go to Logitech for my mice, but the G900 was a little pricey and ugly, the G502 was too heavy and the G402 lacked RGB. I wanted something that had a bunch of buttons for games/productivity wasn't a brick and wasn't terribly expensive for a ""part time"" mouse. Given that I did not anticipate using this for competitive FPS, I accepted an Avago-9800 for the sensor. You can't have it all right? More on that later.

Size: In the same league as a Deathadder or G402/G400s or G502. Slightly larger than a G403.

Shape: (8 of 10) This is clearly designed for palm grippers in mind, which is not ideal for me since I'm a fingertipper. I was concerned about the outward flare on the right side of the mouse. It is obviously intended to support the pinkie in a palm grip and I thought it would get in the way if I fingertipped. Happy, I went ahead an purchased and all is well. It feels a little different, but not bad. Palm grip is very nice (my hands are 18x9cm) and there are actually a couple comfy ways to fingertip. The way the pinky rests actually helped make the mouse grip feel very stable in-hand - so much so that I took it into several matches of CS:GO and did very well! I'm not sure if claw grippers would be happy with this mouse since the primary clicks are attached to the shell and harder to click as you move aft on the mouse. Overall, I'm happier than I expected to be with the shape.

Materials: (9 of 10) Except for the black glossy plastic running down either side along the edge, everything on this mouse is covered in a soft touch finish that feel somewhere between rubber and textured plastic. I was instantly happy with the purchase when I felt the finish. It is smooth and adequately grippy without being anywhere near giving you that icky ""gummy rubber"" sensation. My next concern was durability. After scratching at the back of the mouse with my fingernail I am convinced it will stand the test of time unless you scrape at it with something like a flat head screwdriver. The scroll wheel is covered by relatively flimsy textured rubber. I think you could pull it off if you wanted to with your nails, but I don't have any real durability concerns assuming normal usage. Overall, very happy with the materials and apparent durability.

Weight: (8 of 10) I like light mice. Lighter is better for FPS - let's just get that out of the way. To get full marks for weight, this mouse would have had to come in at 85 grams or less. I give it an 8 out of 10 because the weight is decently light, is customizable and ""terribly well balanced."" Weight was a major concern for me when buying this mouse. Even though I thought I'd use the G403 for shooters, I still didn't want to get stuck with a brick. This mouse has weight tuning and I must say that the weight tuning implementation is snazzy. You push a switch on the bottom of the mouse and a weight tray pops out of the right side of the mouse. The tray houses up to six 4 gram weights and leaves the mouse feeling nicely balanced regardless of how many weights you use because all of them are lined up centrally to the mouse. In other words, unlike other mice, this implementation will keep the mouse's center of gravity centered regardless of how many weights you use.  Terribly well balanced indeed.
I don't have an accurate weight scale at the moment, but with the weights removed I'd say this mouse is in the neighborhood of 96-98 grams - heavier than I like but acceptable and easily controlled. Even though it is heavier than my Logitech G203 and G403, it is stable enough to work just fine for ze flickshotz!

Buttons and Scroll Wheel: (8.5 of 10) The mouse 12 actuators including 5 omron switches. That's pretty decent. Primary clicks are rated at 8 million, which is hardly eye-popping, but for me, that is roughly 8 years worth of use and that assumes it is the only mouse I use. 8 million is still decent bang for the buck. The primary clicks are significantly heavier than my G403 but still quite light and nowhere near a huano. Primary clicks are moderately light but with a decent bass to them, more like a ""thwock"" than the G403's ""tick"" which makes them satisfying in a different way. The scroll wheel is notched with easy yet distinct bumps and has a very slight rattle when shaken. Clicking the scroll wheel requires moderate pressure - good stuff there. Overall, the scroll feels almost identical to my G403 but this mouse also has the benefit of tilt scroll as well. Tilt scroll is something I rarely use, but it's nice to have the option, requires only light pressure and is very easy to use. The rest of the buttons on the mouse all feel decent, the top ones behind the scroll have a dull click while the five thumb buttons all are quiet and tactile with minimal pressure and travel required. Regarding button placement, it's not too bad, but I do have trouble hitting the two rearmost buttons (M4 and M5) independently. If it were me, I'd have designed M4 and M5 as a single button and added another button below the thumb on the left ""wing"" of the mouse, much like the Cougar 600M. Thankfully, if I fail to get the hang of it over the longer term, I can just disable one of them using the software. Overall, buttons are good.

Sensor: (7 out of 10) I've owned a couple mice before this one that had an Avago-9800 sensor. I could not stand them - they were good mice in many ways and I really wanted to love them, but the sensor ruined everything for me because I couldn't take them into CS:GO - the acceleration was just that bad. My expectations for this mouse were similarly low, but I figured I'd just use it for browsing/word processing and switch to a ""proper"" mouse/sensor like the G403 when I wanted to kill stuff dead. I tested the mouse in a match of CS:GO just to remind myself how inferior the 9800 is compared to the 3366. I had 31 kills to 12 deaths my first match...without warmup...on minimal sleep...with a new mouse. Wut? Next match I went 21-12, landing quality shots all the way. In fact, in the last week, I have yet to have a game with a negative kill/death ratio...I thought it was just luck until I saw that this mouse actually has a Avago 9800+ sensor and claims to NOT have acceleration or angle snapping. Well, huh. The 3366 still feels snappier and less ""floaty"" than this one, but where the 3366 is a 10, this is an 7, which is to say decent enough and apparently improved over the old A-9800 which I would have given a 5 out of 10 score. The fact that this mouse could actually be acceptable for shooters has meant that I don't feel the need to switch mouses when gaming. That means the G403 has been missing from my desk for a week now and that I have a $25 mouse that has supplanted a top of the line mouse that I spent $60 on. I think the G403 is the best mouse I've ever had, but given my work/gaming mix right now, the Tecknet is more practical as the daily driver for the time-being.

Software: (Score: 7 of 10) Easy to download, easy to navigate, tons of features including robust macro options and it does not hog system resources. Unobtrusive tool tray icon that actually doesn't stand out enough. You can control macros, DPI profiles, lighting color and breathing rate as well as set different X and Y sensitivity to name a few. As with many peripheral software packages these days, the software does leave you wanting more. It takes a while to boot up and close down. Saving your settings takes several seconds and provides no feedback other than the swirly icon stopping and leaving you wondering ""did it actually save?"" Managing colors is tedious thanks to the interface and changing colors does not happen until after you hit save, meaning that you have to hit save and wait several seconds and repeat several times over in order to tweak the right color shade. Overall the software is perfectly functional and given that I don't need to spend a whole lot of time in it, I don't weigh these negatives very heavily at all and neither should you.

Lighting: (6 out of 10) Lighting is good (albeit a little awkward in the software) but colors appear just slightly washed out relative to my RGB Logitech mice. Also, the illuminated ""TECKNET"" appearing on the mouse is hardly awe-inspiring. The main reason I'm taking points off here is because the orange thumb button lights cannot be changed from orange. For me this is a non-issue since I use a green/orange theme, but others will be irked.

Overall Design and Closing Thoughts: It's not very flashy or expensive and it does not have a premium gaming sensor. BUT the quality is pretty good. The ergonomics are good. The sensor is passable. The functionality and productivity potential is higher than a typical 6-8 button gaming mouse. While nothing about the mouse is truly groundbreaking, a mouse is more about value and function than form for me. None of the flaws listed above justify taking a star off the Amazon rating in my mind, especially given the price point. This is a very versatile mouse that feels just as at home in CS:GO as it does in Word, Excel or Powerpoint. Assuming it holds up over the long haul, it offers superb bang for the buck and easily merits 5 stars as my general ""do-it all"" mouse until something on it breaks.",big review incom total time use 1 week background lot mouse goto logitech g403 late ive hanker someth 6 button typic go logitech mouse g900 littl pricey ugli g502 heavi g402 lack rgb want someth bunch button gamesproduct wasnt brick wasnt terribl expens part time mous given anticip use competit fp accept avago9800 sensor cant right later size leagu deathadd g402g400 g502 slightli larger g403 shape 8 10 clearli design palm gripper mind ideal sinc im fingertipp concern outward flare right side mous obvious intend support pinki palm grip thought would get way fingertip happi went ahead purchas well feel littl differ bad palm grip nice hand 18x9cm actual coupl comfi way fingertip way pinki rest actual help make mous grip feel stabl inhand much took sever match csgo well im sure claw gripper would happi mous sinc primari click attach shell harder click move aft mous overal im happier expect,1513900800,5

51897,4695,4489,"I am a 70 year old gamer and bought my first console December 2016 - the Xbox.  That unit served me well so with new enhancements to the Xbox X I decided to sell my regular Xbox and buy the new Xbox X (Scorpio Edition).  I also purchased a 4 TB Western Digital Passport External Hard Drive (WDBYFT0040BBK) for $99.00 which is working out great and was very simple to connect.  I have had the new console about a month.  I am loving it and, so far, have had no problems with either the console or external HD.

I have the Xbox X connected to an older LG TV.  An unexpected surprise was how much the graphics quality of my games increased even though my TV is not 4K.  I had also planned on purchasing a 4K TV but, with the graphics increase, I may just save the money.  It loads non-4K games slightly faster and seems to create a smoother gameplay.  I also like the reduced console size.  Packaging was good, protected the unit well, and has a pleasant appearance.

Several reviews indicate a variety of problems with the new console.  I have not had any issues with mine (knock one wood).  I also never had any issues with my Xbox One console. I was looking at also purchasing a PS4 Pro (because I like some of their  exclusive games) but there seems to be many problems with that console according to their verified purchase reviews.  Also Sonys tech support appears to be non-existent according to many of their reviewers.  Bottom line, no matter what tech product you get, some are going to have problems.

51909,324,535,"This mouse was purchased for my wife's new RGB setup. I thought I had a steal on my hands. The new 50 million click omron switches plus RGB lighting and a legit 3310 sensor all for 25 bucks? Sign me up, that's a great value! I'll take that over a Sensei 310 any day!

Well...not so fast. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Upon hooking it up to the wife's laptop Christmas morning I started looking for the driver software online. There isn't any. Finding the mouse on the MSI website was a pain, it's not even listed in their mouse lineup page.
(https://us.msi.com/Gaming-gear/#?category=Mouse)
I read the manual. DPI switching takes place on the mouse by pressing and holding the rearmost thumb button on both sides and holding for 5 seconds. This method is also how you change the color breathing between off, fast breathing and slow breathing. And, as it turns out, there is no RGB, only red illumination on the logo. Minus 1 star for false advertising MSI!

Also, because there is no software, there is no macro capability for this mouse. But wait, it gets worse. There is a handy-dandy switch on the bottom of the mouse with three detents labeled ""L"", ""R"" and one with a padlock icon. These are advertised to lock the left thumb buttons for use by a left hander, lock the right side thumb buttons for use by right-hander or lock both sets of thumb buttons for office use. I have a couple issues here. First, the main issue is that you cannot use more than two thumb buttons - you can't use all 4 side buttons on the mouse at once! Even if you could the buttons on the far side are too small, too stiff and have too much travel to be very practical in-game. Locking out ALL the side buttons makes no sense. The thumb buttons would not get in the way during office use. The padlock setting should be an ""all buttons available"" mode instead of none. There might be technical considerations here given there is no software, but it still seems like a poor design decision. Minus 1 star for decreased functionality and design. The second, smaller issue is that L actually locks out right side thumb buttons and vice-versa, opposite as described in the manual, but that's a minor gripe.

So, given the lack of software, macros, RGB and full thumb button utility, what is good about the mouse? Well, it's actually pretty good if you're looking for a basic 6 button mouse with good tracking and an ambidextrous shape. Ergonomics are solid for palm and fingertip but not ideal for claw. The side grips are not rubber, in fact everything is textured plastic on the mouse. It feels nice, but the feel is not as premium as the my wife's previous mouse, the DS100, which not only had a soft touch rubber coating but software support and multiple color options. I'm not bitter...honest.

I'd say that mouse weight is around 95 grams without the flexible braided cable. Tracking is superb as you'd expect with a 3310 and all button clicks are nice and crisp. The primary L/R clicks are awesome, up there with the Logitech G403. Biggest gripe regarding buttons are the thumb buttons. They have significant travel but not too bad but don't stick out very far from the mouse, making unintentional presses hard, but making intentional ones slightly awkward as well - minor gripe. There are 3 large mousefeet which have excellent glide, no issues there. The scroll wheel middle click requires significantly more force than the others, but that's typical. There is a nice rubber coating on the scroll and the wheel has moderate resistance with distinct notches, good for gaming, fine for browsing.

In terms of overall build quality, this mouse is very solid and does not have any kind of rattle or creak when shaken/squeezed. I'd expect this mouse to last a long time. Of course, this review is being written less than a week after purchase. I would have said the same about the last MSI mouse (DS100) which developed a LMB double click issue after less than 1 million clicks and 2 years of light use. (I use Mousotron on all my computers to track such things) The DS100 was rated for 5 million clicks, so it developed issues less than 20% of the way into its advertised lifespan. The wife loved the DS100 and wanted another MSI so the OCD could be satisfied - you simply must have the mouse brand match the laptop brand after all.

She is happier with the mouse than me at this point, which is something of a relief, she is not nearly the mouse officianado that I am, and red (the only lighting color available) does happen to be her favorite color.

In summary, there are aspects of this buying experience that are definitely not cool but we're keeping this rodent and hoping it grows on us:)",mous purchas wife new rgb setup thought steal hand new 50 million click omron switch plu rgb light legit 3310 sensor 25 buck sign that great valu ill take sensei 310 day wellnot fast sound good true probabl upon hook wife laptop christma morn start look driver softwar onlin isnt find mous msi websit pain even list mous lineup page httpsusmsicomgaminggearcategorymous read manual dpi switch take place mous press hold rearmost thumb button side hold 5 second method also chang color breath fast breath slow breath turn rgb red illumin logo minu 1 star fals advertis msi also softwar macro capabl mous wait get wors handydandi switch bottom mous three detent label l r one padlock icon advertis lock left thumb button use left hander lock right side thumb button use righthand lock set thumb button offic use coupl issu first main issu cannot use two thumb button cant use 4 side button mous even could button far side small stiff,1514160000,3

51916,6987,528,"I don't know what the fuss is about this game.  It's well made and although I did not play the previous Aliens game (Colonial Marines I believe), I can't help but think people praised this game since apparently there was a big backlash against Colonial Marines.  Isolation is annoying as hell.  You start out with sort of multi-purpose wrench-like tool (and no, it's not a crowbar), but you first encounter humans with handguns.  You can take them, thinking you can pick up their guns, but no, you cant.  You can pick up their ammo, and even though you can see their guns that they dropped, you cant pick it up.  You acquire it later where its just sitting out on a desk or console.  Its the same thing with the shotgun.  Speaking of which, as far as I can tell, you are on a space station with a single alien, and yet you cant kill the thing.  Later you get Molotov cocktails and a flamethrower, but in the movie Aliens these are effective weapons and you can in fact kill one of these aliens with a shotgun.  What gives?

My second complaint is the level design.  It goes something like this: get to the other side and pull some levers, get to the other side and push a button, finally get to the other side again where the exit is to the next level.  What makes this so frustrating?  The behavior of the alien is exactly the same.  Literally, exactly the same.  This is why I ended up doing this: Id run from room to room and then hide in a locker.  The alien would stalk around the room, take a good look at the locker you are hiding in (which you can see through the vents of the locker) and somehow not be able to sense you through some other means like smell/pheromones, and then seeming lose interest and walk away from view.  Then all of the sudden, it pops up and sticks its face right in front of the vents in which case you are supposed to lean back and hold your breath until it leaves again.  Then I wait for enough time for the alien to put some distance between us, then run the next room or if I am feeling luck, Ill move two rooms closer to my goal.  This is not scary if it happens every single time.  The weapons you do have only cause the alien to break off its attack and slink away until it feels like killing you again.  Sometimes this is necessary, but resources are scarce (theres a crafting system), and so you should avoid unnecessarily using weapons against the alien.  That is why I used the strategy I explained.  I did not finish the game because it was so ridiculous, and I have no idea how the game could possibly redeem itself had I finished it.",dont know fuss game well made although play previou alien game coloni marin believ cant help think peopl prais game sinc appar big backlash coloni marin isol annoy hell start sort multipurpos wrenchlik tool crowbar first encount human handgun take think pick gun cant pick ammo even though see gun drop cant pick acquir later sit desk consol thing shotgun speak far tell space station singl alien yet cant kill thing later get molotov cocktail flamethrow movi alien effect weapon fact kill one alien shotgun give second complaint level design goe someth like get side pull lever get side push button final get side exit next level make frustrat behavior alien exactli liter exactli end id run room room hide locker alien would stalk around room take good look locker hide see vent locker,1514160000,3

51927,9084,75,"I have mixed feelings about this mouse. The mouse itself is amazing. It has plenty of buttons, an amazing sensor with 1 to 1 tracking (I tested it), and an option to switch between a free moving scroll wheel and a normal one. With that said, there are a number of things I found that took away from this mouse.

Being someone with doll hands this mouse felt nice in my hand. But due to the way I hold it (I use a palm grip), my thumb is forced into an awkward position that simply isn't comfortable. I caught myself constantly shifting my hand around, just trying to find a comfortable position for my fingers. The buttons my the thumb are way too high for my personal preference, and to me were very difficult to click mid game.

The right side of the mouse for me was a complete failure. Once again, this could be due to my rather small hand size, but I couldn't, for the life of me, get my fingers to stay on on the mouse.

The biggest flaw in my eyes that made me feel the need to refund this product was the feet on the mouse. For whatever reason, I hold my mouse so that more pressure goes on the right side of the mouse than the left. This extra pressure on the right would cause the mouse to slightly ""roll"" clockwise in the air. This ever so slight roll would cause a contact failure between the feet of the mouse and the surface it was being used on. As a result, the mouse would skid around, as if I had simply ripped the feet off the mouse. This would constantly distract me from the games I would be playing (Primarily CS:GO, my usual go-to mouse tester) and get me killed due to the loss of accuracy. This flaw completely ruined my experience using this mouse. I have since gone back to using my old Steelseries mice, as they don't have this same issue as the g502 does.",mix feel mous mous amaz plenti button amaz sensor 1 1 track test option switch free move scroll wheel normal one said number thing found took away mous someon doll hand mous felt nice hand due way hold use palm grip thumb forc awkward posit simpli isnt comfort caught constantli shift hand around tri find comfort posit finger button thumb way high person prefer difficult click mid game right side mous complet failur could due rather small hand size couldnt life get finger stay mous biggest flaw eye made feel need refund product foot mous whatev reason hold mous pressur goe right side mous left extra pressur right would caus mous slightli roll clockwis air ever slight roll would caus contact failur foot mous surfac use result mous would skid around simpli rip foot mous would constantli distract game would play primarili csgo usual goto,1514160000,2

In many ways it was more streamlined and better then the 2nd, but there is just a few too many glitches and issues to ignore.  Wandering why you somehow got taken out by a soldier standing in an area that makes no sense?  You'll find out several games later when the landscape doesn't form for YOU properly and you are doing the same things to other players.  There was one time I probably drove the plant team insane trying to figure out WHO THE SNOT IS SHOOTING THE SUNFLOWER LIGHTHOUSE (this will make sense once you play Gardens and Graveyards mode).  Well is was me......not inside the lighthouse.  Because it was one of the few times I've had this occur to my advantage.

Using the Garlic drone and Engineer bot is risky business.  When those things get shot down, there is about a 5% chance your game is just NOT going to load back properly to your actual character.

These and a few other glitches notwithstanding........this is the GOLD STANDARD on how to do ""Pack Progression"" correctly.  Random unlocks are nothing to be feared.

This then can be spent on a large assortment of ""sticker packs"" which give you anything from summonable zombies, plantable plants, cosmetic adjustments, modified abilities, new character variants (which all play a bit differently from the base class with a different primary weapon) and more.

The game also rewards individual classes for doing their job.  Engineers can make bank by establishing forward teleporter positions, making it easier for you team to raid (and getting coins everytime someone then uses it).  Cactus get extra coins if OTHER classes are able to take advantage of well placed cover.  Chompers get a hefty amount of coins for ""shield breaking"" the outer shell of tougher zombies with a burrow emerge (no idea why this got omitted from the second game).  Pretty much every class has special coin boosts and it promotes newer and inexperienced players to AT LEAST do their job if nothing else.

As for basic random progression, this should be considered a good thing.  Some folks will get frustrated that they don't get exactly the variants the want and have no where specific to go to find them, but the upside is it makes it a VERY unique experience for every player.  I still remember my first Zombie unlock on my XBOX One account, The Goalie Star.  To me, he looked great, did a little less damage then normal but slowed and froze enemies, and gave me my love for the All-star Class.  A friend of mine unlocked the Toxic Pea first, arguably the best ""trooper"" type on the plant side, played that guy once and never looked back.  This makes for a fun experience where you never know what you are going to get.  These classes all have downsides to their standard variant, and don't break the game that some players get some before others.

One could argue that there are 3 upgrade stickers that get thrown into the sticker pool once a particular zombie or plant has been unlocked and they are too weak to play until you get those.  One, the upgrades are marginal.  Two, you gain a crap ton of coins from the co-operative mode, Garden Ops, which you can play until you unlock those. Three, there is always the welcome matt you can play until you get enough coins to buy more packs to unlock their extras.

Finally, the achievement vs experience system is great.  To level up your characters, you need accomplish achievements such us a particular move so many times, take out so many enemies, or even take out so many players.  Some of these can be rather circumstantial, tricky, or just plain really difficult.  Not to worry.  The packs have you covered on that as well.  As you are opening packs you get ""Star Challenge Skip"" stickers which always you to automatically unlock that achievement.  So basically, however you want to play the game, you will eventually, through attrition, get everyone to max level anyway (which is more a bragging thing then anything.  The later levels just give you additional coins, not more hit points or new stickers or anything).  It allows the game to be goal oriented, encourages players to try new things, but at the end of the day, if you are struggling or the other players are making it impossible to accomplish some (take out Bonk Choy plants for example.....if the players aren't planting them, you can't exactly get this done) you can skip it.  And you earned it by some other means, since that was you sticker in your pack!!

So all and all, it would be nice for more games to use this overall method of progression if they are going the ""pack/loot box"" route with microtrans as a side income.  At no point did I feel I needed to buy additional coins, and there was an obvious ""pros vs cons"" for any character that I saw people using once I really got a decent amount of exposure to them before I got them.

(As a side, the one exception was the Tank Commander Zombie.  I was always floor how fast they could kill me all of a sudden and thought they must be broken and was confused I didn't see them more......until I unlocked him.  Guy is literally running around with a tank cannon that is hard to hit with, doesn't do the greatest damage, until you CRIT on someone.

51942,2633,2201,"I have had this mouse since 2012 and absolutely love the shape and feel of it.

Design: Nothing too spectacular, looks good but not amazing in my opinion.

Overall: I mainly use this mouse for gaming. It's extremely comfortable, so if you're looking for just a daily usage or a light gaming (As in you don't game a lot) mouse I would highly recommend this if the price isn't too high. This mouse is fairly heavy, but to me that's not a con. I do love the way it feels and the weight of it compared to an extremely light mouse.

It has four programmable buttons on the side where your thumb rests, which is great. I pretty much use at least 2 of those buttons in every single game I play. The on the fly DPI switch is great too, very easy to change mid-game to your pre-defined settings. The actual Logitech Software is great too, never had any issues with that. You're able to customize your buttons and create macros from within there. This mouse also has an ""infinite"" scroll wheel option you can turn on or off with the click of a button. I really haven't found any personal use to this other than it just being a bit fun to spin!

My only real complaints about this mouse is the battery life is not the best, it may also be due to the fact that I'm still using the battery it came with. No problems plugging it in and playing at the same time though. Now I'm not just sure if this is me or if its the actual laser sensor on the mouse. While gaming, I notice that sometimes this mouse isn't the most accurate. Especially when ""Pixel peeking"" in FPS Games. I feel like the mouse jumps around a bit too much and skips pixels. It's hard to describe, but the best way I can say it is...Imagine your drawing a straight line and out of nowhere your pen skips that perfect straight line a bit. So in that end result, you have gaps in that line.

Other than those few issues, I absolutely love this mouse. It's extremely comfortable and the thumb rest on it is great. It may not be the best for heavy gamers like myself, but anything from just daily use to some light gaming I'm positive you'd love it.",mous sinc 2012 absolut love shape feel design noth spectacular look good amaz opinion overal mainli use mous game extrem comfort your look daili usag light game dont game lot mous would highli recommend price isnt high mous fairli heavi that con love way feel weight compar extrem light mous four programm button side thumb rest great pretti much use least 2 button everi singl game play fli dpi switch great easi chang midgam predefin set actual logitech softwar great never issu your abl custom button creat macro within mous also infinit scroll wheel option turn click button realli havent found person use bit fun spin real complaint mous batteri life best may also due fact im still use batteri came problem plug play time though im sure actual laser sensor mous game notic sometim mous isnt accur especi pixel peek fp game feel like,1514246400,4

Due to me and my OCD, personally I didn't really want this big usb stick anywhere on my PC. I ended up getting it though and just stuck it at the back of my PC and it was hidden.

A little side story, I ended up purchasing a new Xbox One Controller as well. I mainly got this because I preferred to connect with the built in Bluetooth on my Motherboard and to have no USB Adapter. I'm not sure why, but I had so many issues with trying to connect my controller with Bluetooth. Between taking forever to connect and frequently losing connection (When I'm sitting right next to my PC), I decided to give up on it.

That's when I truly appreciated the ease and usefulness of this little adapter. Connecting a controller is in a snap and I never lose connection, unless my batteries are low. I don't notice any lag/delay either. Works great for when I am on the PC and want to play games that are more comfortable with a controller, like Racing games for example.

If you want the ease of being able to use your Xbox One Controller on your PC, this is the way to go! Simple and easy.

GAME COLLECTION:

 PROS

1. Good set for the money. Lots of classics here  7 or so sonic games, golden axe, altered beast, comix zone. There is a good chunk I am not familiar with, but paying 20 or so dollars for even just the sonic games is a pretty decent deal.

2. Decent amount of video options. Either a 4:3 pillar boxed reminiscent of the old tube tvs  or a stretched 16:9 to fill a wide screen monitor  which looks like ass. You can also smooth the sprites, but they make everything look all melty and terrible. Just play without it

3. Games I tested ran smoothly  sonic 3, shining force, phantasy star II. Didnt have any audio sync issues or weird video lag.

4. Games looked nice. Despite the age and technology, the sprites and backgrounds hold up really well in the HD presentation

5. You can remap controls if that is your thing.

6. Nice to be able to save from the console options rather than having to save in game at designated locations.

CONS:

1. Despite having a smoothing filter, there are no other filters present that would be included in a typical emulator  scanlines, etc.

2. There are video and control options, but I wasn't able to find audio options in the games I tested.  I would prefer to hear the music track louder than the text scroll or game effects. I suspect the old games have everything mixed together which is why this option is omitted.

3. No way to speed up gameplay. Another staple of emulation is being able to speed up games 2X, 4X, 8X, or more to get through boring animations, text boxes, or just grinding out random battles. This option seems to be missing here.

SHINING STAR:

 I wanted to pick a game I had NO familiarity with as to not let nostalgia bias my critique. I am playing this game blind, without any help from the internet.

 PROS:

1. Sprites are a good representation of what SEGA Genesis was capable of at the time.

2. Very straight forward story. Doesnt drown you in exposition. You start the game and you are thrust into action.

3. Good gameplay  VERY similar to Fire Emblem or FF Tactics, which I like. Even has the promotion aspect to level your characters.

4. Interaction is a neat idea, but flawed in execution.

5. Interesting characters and locations.

6. Hard but rewarding battles.

CONS:

1. Inventory is limited. Can only hold 4 items on a character and there is no backpack or caravan to dump items into.

2. No way to know what items do. Especially health items. You go to a shop and expect a quick menu or something that says the herbs will replenish 10 HP or something, but it just isn't there. Only by using the items do you learn their properties.

3. Turn order is a mystery. No on screen meter or anything to let you know how many enemy turns it takes to be yours.

4. Enemy turns take forever. You will be up against about 15  20 enemies and you must watch ALL of their turns. Even if they do not move. There is no way to speed it up or skip it.

5. Cannot speed up or skip text, battle animations, turn moves. Everything happens in real time and is pretty slow once you are on about move 30 and just trying to kill the enemy.

6. I mentioned that the interaction is a neat idea, but flawed. The game ties everything to an action choice box pop up and you have to choose talk look item. It is kind of like a point and click game on PC, but doesnt really work on console. It would be easier if all inventory options like healing items, equipment, status were tied to the START button (like normal) and the A button (or X on PS3) just let you talk to people. I don't know why search needs to be hidden under a popup, just have me talk/search with the same button.

Overall the game is a product of its time. Most RPGs in the early 90s were still in their infancy. A lot of these quality of life options probably won't be introduced for a few years, but it is definitely hard to go back and play an older game with modern game styles on the mind. I never would have liked this as a kid. Sonic games were my bread and butter and simple hack n slash games like Golden Axe. This game requires patience, strategy, forethought, and resource conservation. Nine year old me would have been miserable. No wonder I never heard of this game before

I would recommend this collection if you can get it for under 20 dollars. Like I said, just getting the basic classics most people are familiar with makes having this worth it. There are definitely some lost gems to get introduced to, but be aware that these games are over 20 years old and probably won't play like you wish they would.",review littl hefti plan review main game collect one pick game random review give potenti buyer idea expect typic 90 era sega game game collect pro 1 good set money lot classic 7 sonic game golden axe alter beast comix zone good chunk familiar pay 20 dollar even sonic game pretti decent deal 2 decent amount video option either 43 pillar box reminisc old tube tv stretch 169 fill wide screen monitor look like as also smooth sprite make everyth look melti terribl play without 3 game test ran smoothli sonic 3 shine forc phantasi star ii didnt audio sync issu weird video lag 4 game look nice despit age technolog sprite background hold realli well hd present 5 remap control thing 6 nice abl save consol option rather save game design locat con 1 despit smooth filter filter present would includ typic emul scanlin etc 2 video control option wasnt abl find audio option game test would prefer hear music track louder text scroll game effect suspect old game everyth mix togeth option omit 3 way,1514419200,4

52034,3185,3205,"Firstly, this mouse is awesome. The shape is fantastic. It's a little smaller than my old Deathadder, but it feels a lot nicer in my hands. The buttons register a lot nicer as well, and I'm able to 'tap' in game with a lot more control now. I don't know what the sensor is, but its perfection. It's also very light - which I like.  It does exactly what I want it to, and nothing extra.

I love the 'no software needed' method they have of doing it - but the weird online site you have to use to test the hz is kind of annoying. A simply interface or an additional tiny led on the mouse to show hz would have been great. But it is such a good mouse. I can see why all the ""pros"" use it, or have at some point used it - its amazing.

The materials on it, the plastics, feel a bit 'dated' at first. Compared to the soft touch plastics of SteelSeries and Razer it feels a bit on the cheaper side. That said, I don't actually miss the rubber materials on the side with this mouse. When you compare it, it feels dated, but once you start using it the materials are actually really really good. I can hold it firm, its comfortable, and it doesn't get all ""slidey"" when the hands get sweaty.

Then the bad stuff - or should I say, the bad thing. It is literally the only thing that is stopping me from giving it 5 stars.

The cord, WHY OH WHY IS IT NOT BRAIDED?! I've been using it for going on 3 hours, and in that time, I think I've spent about as much time trying to straighten the cord out to stop it from bending into the table, or the screen, or looping on itself, or pushing into the mousepad. It's AWFUL!!! Nothing seems to help.

It completely ruined my first few hours with this mouse, because it is such a good mouse. After 2 days of messing around with it (every 2 minutes it seemed) I have it at the point that its ok now. I just packed my deathadder up, and the braided cable on that has none of these issues.

I'm giving BenQ ZOWIE the benefit of the doubt that this is just an old design that hasn't been touched. But it is ridiculous that such a small thing like the cord could have such a bad effect on the user experience of what is otherwise, one of the best products in it's market.

Fix the cord, 5 stars, full stop.

My other - slight - issue is the mouse wheel. The scrolling feels and sounds a bit cheap, and it almost feels a bit inconsistent. The button push is also very tough to press in.

52039,3435,3841,"Warframe follows the golden path approach of pay-to-win MMORPG's. You ""can"" pay $400 to instantly get every piece of gear, every buff, every prime Frame, every everything, and you'd still be only better-than-average.

PROS:
Gorgeous graphics
Great mission variety
Great and diverse Bosses
Beautiful tutorials
Entertaining and varied characters
No Pay-to-win, mostly Pay-to-look-cool with some Pay-For-An-Edge
User designed content that doesn't suck

CONS:
Steep learning
Some tutorials are absent
Weird market setup
Some levels impossible to solo
Some bizarre leveling mechanics

Graphics and gorgeous. While you can tell they lifted the Infected from Halo, the environs and the characters are beautifully drawn and decently varied on some central themes. Otherwise the levels, even when repetitious, are only really noticeable at the start and end, and are so enormous that really only starts to crop out after 30+hours of play.

This is even better on PS4. Every mechanic is simplified and works great. You have to grind for components to make new gear and warframes, but otherwise you're in a march across the solar system.

The story is actually pretty good, and is gradually revealed in sidebars and codex entries, as well as a steadily growing number of quests and campaigns. The bosses are fun and have a reason to grind up as they provide mats to make new Warframes by the boss.

There are a few humps. Right around Mars and again around Saturn, the difficulty takes a significant jump. Grinding starts in full force at that point, but its varied enough and fleshed out enough that it feels like a 10% grinding as opposed to WOW grinding. You collect materials to make new gear and weaponry, do alerts and syndicates to get access to speciality items and powers and apparel, and begin participating in PVP and major events, so theres so much to do once you hit a grindwall that its a major annoyance but not a derailment of the progression.

PVP also adds a decent flavor. Even a vanilla level 1 guy with little experience can still get a some decent points.

As usual, the only real limit is the paywall. Not for anything significant, but you're limited in the number of slots you have for mechs, weps and drones, meaning that you could get stuck with only 1 suit, and be required to fork out $20 for platinum to get the slot for a second one. Its also irritating that you can pay for stuff with platinum, and they bury the mechanism by which you can get it with in game currency as a blueprint.",warfram follow golden path approach paytowin mmorpg pay 400 instantli get everi piec gear everi buff everi prime frame everi everyth youd still betterthanaverag pro gorgeou graphic great mission varieti great diver bos beauti tutori entertain vari charact paytowin mostli paytolookcool payforanedg user design content doesnt suck con steep learn tutori absent weird market setup level imposs solo bizarr level mechan graphic gorgeou tell lift infect halo environ charact beauti drawn decent vari central theme otherwis level even repetiti realli notic start end enorm realli start crop 30hour play even better ps4 everi mechan simplifi work great grind compon make new gear warfram otherwis your march across solar system stori actual pretti good gradual reveal sidebar codex entri well steadili grow number quest campaign bos fun reason grind provid mat make new warfram bos hump right around mar around saturn difficulti take signific jump grind start full forc point vari enough flesh enough feel like 10 grind oppos wow grind collect materi make new gear weaponri alert syndic get access special item power apparel begin particip pvp major event,1514419200,5

52042,2280,220,"This review is for the PS4 limited edition version.

After playing the Ezio collection about a year ago, I was hooked on the AC series.  So, I bought this game along with Syndicate and Black Flag and although I have had some issues with the different games, I have enjoyed playing the series.  With the last three games, I have played them a bit out of order in terms of when they were released by playing Syndicate (2015), then Black Flag (2013) before playing Unity, which was release between those two in 2014.

One of my complaints with the Ezio collection and black flag is the awkward feel of the controls, especially for jumping and climbing which didn't feel smooth.  I eventually got use to it, but even after playing through those games, I still struggled at times with the jump and climbing.  Syndicate fixed those issues with easier climbing and smoother controls overall.  Luckily, Unity plays more like Syndicate in that respect with climbing and jumping.  The only complaint I have about the control layout is the change from how you access your vision, which moved to the triangle button as opposed to how it has been in all the other games.  Maybe it is because I got use to how it was in Syndicate, but I am constantly hitting the triangle in the middle of combat.  The eagle vision last only a temporary period of time, which I am not sure I am a fan of either.

As it with the other AC games that I have played, there is lots to do with the main missions, side missions and collecting stuff.  The collecting of the various objects throughout the game are the least favorite aspect of all of the AC games as they are time consuming and repetitive.  Although not as difficult to find as in Syndicate, some are hard to locate and see, even with the new 3D map.  I haven't decided if I like the 3D map as in some instances it does help and some ways it doesnt.  Locating some objects, especially those inside buildings can be a bit of a pain as the map and distance to object doesnt always clearly mark the location.

The missions and side missions are pretty similar to the previous games and very similar to Syndicate in a lot of ways.  The landscape is detailed and well done with really good graphics as I have come to expect with the latter AC games.  The basic gameplay is essentially the same as most of the AC games that I have played.  It makes it easy to get started and playing but at the same time, it only has a few additions to make it different than the previous games.

There is plenty to see and do though and it is fun to explore around the city, including the inside of various buildings.  I do wish there was more interactive with the people and environment in the city.

Like the other AC games, there are the occasional glitchy camera views that make it hard to see and do things, such as the landscape blocking my view in the middle of a fight.  There is still some finicky-ness with button pushes at times at certain locations but not as bad as the earlier games.  I miss the grapple gun from Syndicate which at least so far, I don't think is in Unity.  Considering I am getting into this game 3 years after release, I avoided most of the early game bugs and got the game for less than 20 bucks on top of it.

Unity can be played in conjunction with a Unity phone app but I found the app game to be pretty boring and glitchy as it disconnects quite frequently.  It tended to slow my game down instead of enhancing it.

The missions are a bit tougher than Syndicate and Black Flag in my opinion.  The fighting doesnt feel as smooth as Syndicate though.  The story is ok as well, maybe not as strong as the other games in the series but I found it entertaining enough.

I am not a big MP gamer but there are Coop missions as well which can be a change of pace.

Although this doesnt stray far from the AC formula, the game is still fun to play even with some of its flaws.

52053,1590,4478,"South Park: The Fractured but Whole is even more outrageous than the show, if you can imagine that. To be expected, there's a lot of comical profanity, absurd situations, and toilet humor. Quite literally, one of the achievements is to poop in every toilet you find in the game.

Fans of the show will appreciate the attention to detail and seeing their favorite characters from the South Park universe. The SP: FBW looks just like the show, with many many lines of dialog recorded specifically for the game. Gameplay, though, can be very slow and repetitive. You play as a genderless, nameless, silent ""New Kid"". As you meet more characters from the show, they become your allies and you can use their special superhero powers to fight villains and solve puzzles. The title of the game is a pun. Amazon won't let me type that word, but say the last two words together fast and you'll get the idea. Your character's super power is farts. I'm not kidding.

I don't like the turn-based RPG-styled combat system. It's very slow-paced. Ultimate moves animation is unskippable. Seeing them the first time is fun, but I don't want to watch the animation over and over again.

You can set the difficulty at any time to suit your preferences and desired challenge level. There are 4 levels. At 3, it's very hard, so if you're a casual gamer, I recommend level 2.

Overall, the game is OK... It starts off very slow but gets better half-way through the game. Load times are fast, so that's one thing I can definitely say is good. It's more of an interactive episode than a bonafide RPG. The gameplay elements are just to advance the storyline and the gameplay itself isn't very fulfilling. This game is for serious fans of the show only, and not hardcore gamers, as the fighting is very repetitive as I said before. In some battles, it's really ridiculous and frustrating (like fighting Mitch Conner because he cheats and takes extra turns).

I finished it in a little over 30 hours on Heroic difficulty (middle level). Don't bother with the DLC ""Danger Deck"". It's just a bunch of simulations of boss fights and other characters, with amped up difficulty. The rewards are rare costumes. I accidentally bought it and it's a total waste of $5.

52067,6157,1140,"The stick its self is great. I have used an old st290 pro for years, got it way back for Star Wars Galaxies Jump To Light speed. I mention for reference. Used it in many games from Arma to X-plane, Microsoft Flight Sim, Elite and Star citizen. But with the growing number of buttons and functions with games like Elite and SC, the HOTAS becomes more important. Especially if you use a lot of vector changing, I.E. strafing in combat. This is where HOTAS prevails as an option. Being able to bind buttons as shift functions increasing the amount of controls to the HOTAS,  also allows the set up of different profiles. Which makes changing say flight controls to SRV controls easy. The twist can be locked closed, the throttle detached, the buttons completely reprogramed with non volatile memory, stick has adjustable tension. My only complaint so far is the throttle feels sloppy, it will fall under its own weight putting the ship in full thrust. It will not hold at 75-90 percent position, without your hand staying on the throttle. It is also an older hotas meant for ps3 and pc. At first it seems like no big deal, then you see the newer ones are much better in terms of functionality. In games like SC the rudder paddles can not be assigned for strafing left/right, in 4axis it will roll though.

52073,3021,4227,"Despite all the negative reviews, this isn't even a horrible capture card, it's decent actually. However, it is improperly listed.
This is NOT a high definition capture card. It utilizes the eMPIA 2828X ""USB Grabber"" video chip. This chip maxes out at 480i. This capture card was clearly designed to capture standard definition video and not high definition. Any signal above 480i will not be registered by the video chip. I couldn't even get 480p to record.

Now, that doesn't mean the capture card is horrible. Some people, like myself, don't care about high definition video capture but wanted a device to capture old, retro video game consoles like the original PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Assuming you're one of these people, how does this stack up?

The outside is designed pretty well, actually. This is the first capture card I've had with a pass-through, meaning, your video signal comes in one end and leaves the other end. This is great because it defeats the need for a splitter since the signal will pass through the device to your television. This device also has a port for a microphone, which is a neat little addition if you don't have a microphone port, and the form-factor is nice. My Easycap would damage my USB ports since it was such a heavy dongle, while this uses an external USB cable to connect to your computer so no weight is actually placed on your USB port.

The inside is where most people's complaints come from, mainly the eMPIA video chip. This chip maxes out at 480i, so if you were hoping for 480p or even 720p/1080i video recording through the component ports, that's not going to happen. The deinterlacing also isn't very good, so interlacing is very noticeable in the actual recordings. The recording also look a little washed out. All in all, the video quality is not good, but it's not atrocious. If you are streaming something like the Wii or original Xbox, it will be quite noticeable because those games visually look great, but if you go something really old school like N64 or PS1, or even NES or SNES, the video artifacts become less apparent. I am fine with the video quality on this device as someone who records and streams retro games very very casually. You should definitely not get this card if you are expecting to high quality professional-level recordings, it won't give you that.

A lot of people have had trouble getting this device to even work, I've had no trouble. It works fine in my experience. The issue is that the eMPIA drivers are Windows-only and are required to be installed from the installation CD. There's no Linux support (believe me, I tried) and to my knowledge no Mac support. This is by no means a plug-in-play device. After you setup the divers, you should easily be able to import the device into OBS for recording and streaming. If you switch between using the component jacks or the composite jacks on the Gamecap, you have to open up VivaStation and switch the input source and then restart OBS. OBS won't automatically be able to detect the change and will just give you a white screen. Also, don't forget that this cannot record above 480i. So if you are still getting a blank screen, make sure your device does not have progressive scan enabled.

I bought this device for standard definition recording as someone who extremely casually does so. The video quality is not amazing but it is good enough for someone like me. The device is very nicely designed with the pass-through video ports, the external USB connection and the additional microphone slot. But the video chip is not the best and it's annoying when software isn't plug-in-play because it takes some time to setup and does not work on every machine.

I think Amazon really needs to fix their listing for this device. I think this device would get much better reviews, at least 3 stars, if the listing wasn't so misleading. This isn't even the developer's fault. The device never claims to be an ""HD recorder"" on the box.",despit neg review isnt even horribl captur card decent actual howev improperli list high definit captur card util empia 2828x usb grabber video chip chip max 480i captur card clearli design captur standard definit video high definit signal 480i regist video chip couldnt even get 480p record doesnt mean captur card horribl peopl like dont care high definit video captur want devic captur old retro video game consol like origin playstat nintendo 64 assum your one peopl stack outsid design pretti well actual first captur card ive passthrough mean video signal come one end leav end great defeat need splitter sinc signal pas devic televis devic also port microphon neat littl addit dont microphon port formfactor nice easycap would damag usb port sinc heavi dongl use extern usb cabl connect comput weight actual place usb port insid peopl complaint come mainli empia video chip chip max 480i hope 480p even 720p1080i video record compon port that go happen deinterlac also isnt good interlac notic actual record record,1514505600,3

52092,292,4320,"I used to be an avid gamer in my youth, but have gotten more selective in my games and game much less nowadays.

...But this game is one of the very few that I will rave about, and I have literally spent hours, hours playing this in one sitting, and said sittings have happened A LOT with this game.

I won't go into all of the features of this game, there's enough about that already in other reviews and other places on the Internet.

I feel this game really struck an excellent balance.  The game's story covers a lot, yet leaves enough questions unanswered that you keep playing and muse about what you discover in the game.  You learn about the game's characters, but the story never wanders off on a tangent.  The game's story also explores some unique situations.  Why humans worship, or hate and loathe, things that they don't understand, why some cultures empower one gender and don't seek equality, and other cultures pursue equality so much they become blind to issues surrounding that.

That's just a few examples. But, and this is a big ""but"" for me, the game never pushes past boundaries, at least to me they didn't.  Yeah, I have my own religious, philosophical, and political views, but in a modern world so open I don't like discussing such matters, and I get weary when the media brings such matters to me.  But with this game, it presented the issues in a way that made me think, yet didn't make me feel like the game's developers were trying to push their views.  Again, given today's open minded world, I think what the developers have done in this game is a fine line that very few can walk.  Also, I like that this game doesn't zero in on any of the issues.  Since the main character, Aloy, is an attractive young woman, you'll find some of the people around her will try to interact with her in a certain way.  But since Aloy is very goal driven, there's no excessive innuendo or ""mature"" tensions.  Violence is also scaled down;  You will have to fight other humans and even in many cases, act as a detective and investigate crime scenes.  There's signs and displays of blood and bloodshed, but there's no gore or sharp displays of violence.  I for one appreciate that.

Graphics are top notch.  The only immediate quibble I have is Aloy has long, flowing red hair.  Her hair is just too lively, it flutters and swings majestically, even if you're in a building where there wouldn't be any air pressure to move hair like that.  Descending downward makes her hair dance about wildly, enough to where it might distract you.  Honestly though, given how amazing everything, and everyone looks in this game, this is a small complaint.

Controls and game mechanics are tight, save for a few situations.  The one situation that comes to mind is steep, rocky terrain.  Sometimes Aloy will nimbly scale up said terrain, sometimes you have to keep mashing the jump button until she jumps high enough to land up where you want her to, and sometimes she flat out won't interact with the terrain no matter what control inputs you give.  It's frustrating occasionally, but it's a reminder that although the game is open world, that doesn't mean you can literally go wherever you want.  There are some areas where you do have to follow a linear path.  But if you're a thorough and stalwart explorer, there's PLENTY of items to find if you explore said paths.

Weapon usage is a sheer joy.  Melee attacks with the spear look and execute awkwardly a good part of the time, but they work well.  All of the ranged weapons work great, and there's enough variety in ranged weapons for a myriad of strategies to implement in hunting machines, but not so many weapons that it gets overwhelming.

Now, hunting.... What. a. BLAST!!  Hunting machines is such a wild THRILL that I constantly sidetrack from quests to hunt.  A sidequest that would take 20 minutes to complete, or less than 10 minutes if you can fast travel to needed points, will take me an hour or longer just because I always end up facing off against machines that I come across.

The AI in the machines has been executed well, in my opinion.  Some machines will borderline act like training dummies, letting you hit them as you please until they drop.  Others will fight as a primitive animal would, throwing all their might at you then retreating if they can't take you down in short order.  While others still, especially end game machines, will use everything in their arsenal, primitive or advanced, to wipe you out.  There have been times where I've been injured in the game, ran away to hide, only to be finished off in hiding by either the same machine I was fleeing from or another machine who detected my presence and went for an easy kill.  Learning how to interact with components on machines is almost a necessity.  Two examples:

1. You could just hail arrows on the deer-like machine you're hunting and hope the herd it's in doesn't stampede over you as you're firing arrows.  OR, you could scan the machine, realize it has a canister of flammable material on it's back, shoot that canister with a fire arrow and stay quiet.  The canister will eventually explode, destroying the machine you shot at, and damaging/destroying machines near it.

2.  You could try to go head-to-head with the large wolf-like machine that has a large gun on it's back and a radar to find you even if you try to hide.  Or you can equip a weapon whose ammo can rip components off, target the radar component and rip it off, then hide.  Once the machine stops looking for you or you distract it away from you by throwing a rock, you can fire at the gun on it's back, ripping it off.  Then you can pick up that gun and use it to cut down the machine.

So while some of the machines in this game are very tough and smart, being tough and smart yourself will help you stay alive and victorious.

Again, I feel like this game just nailed it on balance.  It's challenging, but not boring or too hard (there' multiple difficulty levels too), it presents unique human issues in the story, but doesn't cross boundaries.  The graphics look awesome, but aren't so perfect that the PS4 isn't taxed heavily.  The controls and game mechanics are solid, but not too tight or fine, but they certainly aren't sloppy.",use avid gamer youth gotten select game game much le nowaday game one rave liter spent hour hour play one sit said sit happen lot game wont go featur game there enough alreadi review place internet feel game realli struck excel balanc game stori cover lot yet leav enough question unansw keep play muse discov game learn game charact stori never wander tangent game stori also explor uniqu situat human worship hate loath thing dont understand cultur empow one gender dont seek equal cultur pursu equal much becom blind issu surround that exampl big game never push past boundari least didnt yeah religi philosoph polit view modern world open dont like discus matter get weari medium bring matter game present issu way made think yet didnt make feel like game develop tri push view given today open mind world think develop done game fine line walk also like game doesnt zero,1514592000,5

52174,7057,1228,"I have played every game since its inception. I have also owned every special edition too. What I struggled with this series so far... is the guardian galaxy. Im not a fan of their weapons, or characters. They look great, but perform poorly. Master Chief and Cortana were a magical duo. I remember spending hours with friends playing halo 1-3. Nastolgia is a word that comes to mind. Unfortunately this particular Halo gets lost in transistion. I feel its trying too hard to accomplish too many things at once. I get that they're trying to give us a break from the MC. However, we don't want that, or at least I don't want that. For some reason I miss the challenges of the covenant and the flood. It was also creepy, I remember the first halo when you meet the flood for the first time. Or 343, not the company but the character. Theres no memborable moments that the original conquest set out to do. I want development, not conflicting paths, and weird aliens. Home is where the heart is and the covenant and cortona aren't its main space. I do love the graphics, ( I got the collection series ).

I also play all of them on legendary and this game has got some points more than other that get so retarded hard it makes me not want to play. I have always had a challenge but never like this to where Im finding loopholes in the game. I enjoyed clearing out a section of foes, and moving to the next.

The Ai is really hit or miss. Sometimes I just watch them when they're trying to heal me just stand or turn around despite me signaling for help. Not as bad as sheva and Chris off of RE5, but not as great as others.

343 really needs to approach a new game, with organic enemies that bring back the sense of fear, heroism and bad-assery that we come to love.

The game is very much like The Witcher 3, but in science fiction plus fantasy setting.  If you enjoyed the Witcher games then this is a must buy.  Be forewarned that it IS extremely difficult as others have stated, even on ""easy"" mode.  Especially early on...  It takes 6-8 hours to level up enough to use weapons better than a metal pipe!!  And you must quest, rather than just kill monsters during those early parts of the game-- as your character will be too weak to slay much of anything early on.  For those who ""stay the course"" past the first 6-8 hours, you are in for a real treat and one of the most enthralling games ever.  Without question I've found this to be one of the most addictive games I have ever played.  My wife is starting to get annoyed with my disappearance, and I'm losing a lot of sleep thanks to Elex!

52218,347,347,"This wheel is a major improvement over a basic Xbox controller, or even Over a basic steering wheel.  The force feedback really makes a huge difference in the feel of the game and the realism!  I hated racing games before I got this, and now they're a blast!

The quality of the force feedback varies by game though... Forza Horizons feedback is jerky and just bad.  Forza Horizon 3 however is smooth, and seems just perfect!

My only complaints with this wheel are the size (its a smaller diameter than a typical car wheel, which takes some getting used to), and the fact that the pedals slide all over on you if you don't have a good way of securing them.  The acceleration pedal could use a stiffer spring as well, for a more realistic feel and to reduce the tendency to floor it all the time.",wheel major improv basic xbox control even basic steer wheel forc feedback realli make huge differ feel game realism hate race game got theyr blast qualiti forc feedback vari game though forza horizon feedback jerki bad forza horizon 3 howev smooth seem perfect complaint wheel size smaller diamet typic car wheel take get use fact pedal slide dont good way secur acceler pedal could use stiffer spring well realist feel reduc tendenc floor time,1514764800,5

Because it is. And it is. But it is also the most frustratingly up and down in quality game I have ever played, and that makes it interesting. And on a certain level, I really, REALLY enjoy analyzing things that are interesting.

Skyrim: Mass Effect OR Arkham City: Primal

A lot of people don't see the connections between this game and Skyrim, Mass Effect, Arkham City, and Farcry:Primal, but to me they are clear to see. It's got the focus which mimics ""Detective Vision"" and ""Hunter Vision"" with it's alternate HUD overlay that highlights certain things. It's got the Mass Effect Conversation Wheel, and silent ""takedowns"" which can be upgraded (slightly). And yes, there's the endless icons cluttering up the map for all the locations and sidequests that you can travel to, a ""fast-travel"" system, and even dungeons (excuse me, CAULDRONS) that feature switches to flip and over-powered bosses to slay. So yes, this game wears it's inspirations on it's sleeve. My first impression: this is the game that Mass Effect:Andromeda SHOULD have been. It's a new world, set in the distant future, that blends science fiction and primitive survival. What a great idea!

Do You Enjoy Fighting For Your Life?

Whether or not you enjoy this game is really going to come down to one question. Do you enjoy the combat? Because if you don't, you aren't going to like this game in all likelihood. Most people seem to be over the moon for the combat for some reason. They love notching arrows, shooting weak points, sneaking up on enemies, performing stealth kills, and thwacking robot dinosaurs over the noggin with a spear. In truth, the combat is deeply flawed and uneven, but some people (or most, apparently) ENJOY the unevenness, and for them, this game is a little piece of heaven.

The Good, The Bad, And the Ugly

The good points of this game are VERY good. The graphics are AMAZING. To the point where I spent a whole lot of time just taking pictures using the photo mode, trying to achieve different framed shots. The combat is nothing if not exciting, and at times, downright awesome. When the game is scripted, it's one of the best scripted adventures I've ever seen, with Prince of Persia style climbing (only better), Arkham City style takedowns from behind, and scripted boss fights and cinematics that are every bit as soon as a summer blockbuster. The problem is...the best parts of this game are few and far between, and poorly implemented, despite the layers and layers and LAYERS of polish (seriously, there are fewer glitches in this game than any I have ever seen). For example:

The story beats for this game are all over the place. There's a deep mystery over Aloy's origin, and deep drama over her status as an outcast at the start of the game. I was REALLY looking forward to a thirty-plus hour adventure to resolve these things. Unfortunately they are both resolved in the first five hours. WHAT?????? I've heard that some people quit this game after the first few hours after resolving these story elements, I can completely understand why. 90% of the impetus to keep playing is immediately removed. There's a mystery about WHY exactly Aloy was born how she was, and what it means, and there's a mystery about a mysterious evil group, but if you've played Mass Effect or Knights of the Old Republic you're probably already groaning when you discover you have to hunt down and take down the Black Suns, I mean Blue Suns, I mean Shadow Carja, I mean Eclipse (whew! I'm tired just thinking about how many times I've taken down the same thugs!). And since I've already discovered I'm a Sith Lord, and the Hero who can unite a Galaxy, and a clone of Sephiroth, I really don't care how or why I was born, especially when I've lived my entire life as an outcast and been raised by an awesome man who exits the story right after it starts. So yeah, the story isn't exactly new. Yes, there is a heavy-handed ridiculous story about the world that's so far fetched I struggled to suspend my disbelief (somehow transforming a planet is easier than hacking a SHUTDOWN CODE??????), but other than a few blockbuster cinematics, this story is told through audio logs and text documents so boring I recommend skipping them all.

It's great that there's a Mass Effect Weapon Wheel. Crafting on the fly is unrealistic but appreciated. But there is so much wrong with this game in terms of management systems of all kinds. For starters, you need to buy or craft fast-travel packs until you purchase an unlimited one. This is a design decision that's beyond stupid. There's camp sites where you can save just about everywhere, but they clutter up the map and frequently spawn you right next to enemies that immediately kill you. Worse yet they are a terrible wasted opportunity. In Panzer Dragoon Saga when you visit a campfire you can save, yes. But you also get to listen to an old man tell you the history of the world and build a bond with your dragon. Those campfire lore minutes were my single favorite part of that game, and I weep for the lost opportunity here.

The need to constantly pick up resources so you can craft ammo and healing items is absolutely ridiculous and tedious. Your health doesn't auto-regenerate, so it's completely possible to be stranded in the middle of nowhere with no healing items, no fast-travel packs, no medicinal herbs, almost no health, and be surrounded by hostile robot dinosaurs. Not my idea of fun.

Then there's the highly un-customizable outfits which somehow manage to be boring, and provide such a limited number of effects that you are constantly switching which one you are wearing to combat just one type of enemy (as opposed to the armors in Mass Effects where you just swap upgrades into your best armor which features all kinds of bonuses, AND looks awesome). Again, crafting ammo on the fly is cool, but why on Earth do you have to craft it at all? It pretty much just ensures that when you need it most, you run out of the one type of ammo you really need and have absolutely no way of getting more.

Then there's the inventory system which seems to have been borrowed straight out of Skyrim. You have hundreds of items which are pretty much useless except to change into money, constantly cluttering up your inventory and forcing you to either discard items or visit merchants to sell huge amounts, either way a huge waste of time and effort. Yuck! All of this could have easily been solved by simply giving you regenerating health! And then there's the quest system...

I never would have climbed a single tallneck or gone through a single cauldron if my wife had not told me to. After I went through two of each, I failed to see why on Earth I did it. Neither was fun, and both were time-consuming. Even worse, the game at no time made it clear that it was important that I do these things. After the prologue, and talking to several people in the village there should have been QUESTS to go the cauldron and the tallneck, and some story-driven REASON for doing so. I found the same with all the other side-quests. Whether or not I found quests (and apparently I missed most of them when I finished the game) was purely random. The game told me at completion I had accomplished less than 50% of the game. This is just plain bad design. I've played the Mass Effect Trilogy countless times, and quests are brought to your attention frequently, allowing you to encounter them and complete them naturally. In HZD it seemed like every time I encountered a quest it wanted me to go in the opposite direction of the main story, and it seems to have absolutely no bearing on said main story. Is it any wonder I only completed a few of the quests?

And then there's the combat. Oh boy. This game had a great opportunity to allow you to craft a warrior who is fast and maneuverable equipping light armor that grants greater speed. But it doens't. Light armor is simply WORSE than heavy armor. Again, yuck! NO increased agility or dodge, just more resistance to the stupid elements. Likewise, if you aren't fond of stealth (I am generally not), you can't craft Aloy into a burly tank of destruction because close-range attacks are almost completely broken, and getting hit close range can so easily kill you. Its worth mentioning that at close range dodge/roll is useless. Seemingly just being CLOSE to attacks takes a bite out of your health. I dodged and dodged and dodged...and died. This is not Nier:Automata where a perfectly timed dodge kicks off combos. In fact, there ARE no close range attack combos. :( This is even sadder because your spear attacks are so bland and awkward, and CANNOT be used defensively. You should be able to lock spear to jaw with the robots and hold them at bay. You should be able to stab at them with your spear to ward them off and get space or escape. Instead you frequently get cornered into a nook and can't see where you are or the beast is, blinding thwacking with your spear like how you wield a sword like a club in Skyrim. This is straight-up TERRIBLE combat.

Add in a run command you use by clicking down on the left stick (instead of simply running when you pressing the left stick all the way in a direction), and you have a recipe for repeated deaths due to bad controls (Aloy should be able to run while crouched, and while in combat should NEVER walk).

The Focus Vision deserves special mention here as a feature that is EXTREMELY poorly implemented. Unlike Hunter Vision or Detective Vision, this ""feature"" does not make HUD elements unnecessary (it doesn't show you where critical plot people are, or important plants are), and it slows you to a CRAWL while you have it enabled. I turned it on all the time only to find it showed me nothing. In combat it's almost useless as I'm standing there like a log while the beasts rip me to shreds, because I""m trying to ""focus"" on them to see their weak point. Ugh! What a pain in the neck!

And last but not least, there are WAY too many dinosaur encounters, and far too many that are ridiculously overpowered, to the point where they become extremely annoying, and the override ability is just about useless. Frequently I was on my way to a story mission, and got ambushed by robot dinos I had no intention of fighting, and suddenly I was fighting for my life, wondering why on Earth I had to KILL the poor beasties just to get where I was going. This usually led to multiple frustrating deaths and/or fast-traveling straight to my mission, which was incredibly frustrating because I ENJOY traveling across the world of HZD when robot dinos aren't constantly trying to kill me! Speaking of which, while I appreciate the lack of blood and gore, why are there no no-lethal methods of dealing with dinos and bandits? I felt like a monster killing hordes of both that were minding their own business, just so I could get a save point and craft items that I desperately needed.

I loved riding on dinos, but I almost never got to do it in the game and that is really really sad. I stopped doing cauldrons after two because I was almost never able to override dinos. 99% of the time when I encountered them they already saw me and so it was too late to attempt override, and they were the wrong kind of beasts to ride anyway. When I COULD override an enemy and ride them, I almost always had to quickly dismount after a short time because the game forced me to.

The Awesome

If I have so many things I don't like about this game, why do I give it four stars? Because despite all the low points, mediocre points, and abundant frustrations, despite all the flaws and examples of bad design, this game does some things REALLY well.

Aloy is one of the greatest video game characters ever created. Despite her rather thin backstory and cheesy dialog, Ashly Burch brings the character to life so completely that everyone and anyone will fall in love with her. While you are running across the game world, Aloy keeps a constant running commentary on everything happening (a trick stolen from the awesome Tomb Raider:Legend) which keeps you from feeling depressed, lonely, and desolate. Everything about this character is amazing. The voice acting, yes. But the facial animation (which is the best I've ever seen for EVERY character in the game) is the absolute pinnacle for Aloy. Her young, earnest, perfectly expressive, courageous, idealistic, hopeful face commands your attention and brings the character to life (I suspect some extremely high quality motion capture). But more than that. When she walks, she walks like a young woman (her hips sway as she confidently strides), she stalks like a Native American (hunched down powerfully to spring into action, stealthily sneaking through the underbrush), and her HAIR is a character unto itself. I wish she got dirt or mud on her face and washed it off in the mountain streams (or took a drink of water). I wish she slept in inns to restore her health and laughed and sang around the campfire. I wish she shouted out across the mountains to other braves, and I wih more than anything she rode a strider alongside other warriors to hunt machines (because she spends far too much time alone), but what she is in this game is still incredible and deserving of all the praise I can muster.

When the story in this game is good it's AMAZING. I hated going through most of the old purple-hued buildings searching for who know's what in auto-logs and such, but I loved the the late game cinematics and story-based climbing missions. The prologue of the game has thrilling platforming, rousing music, and heart-wrenching emotion (not enough to make me cry, but still). I just wish there was more of it, instead of all the open-world machine killing frustration which felt so empty and pointless. Likewise the musical score for this game is excellent. I wish more of it was slow-paced and melancholy instead of so much action music, but it's still a fine score.

And while I had many, many serious issues with the combat (that swapping out weapons in your slot is necessary, and the icons and usage of support items is so incredibly counter-intuitive, and pretty much no one uses the tedious and mostly useless traps), when it worked, it REALLY worked. The first time I encountered a Stormbird (after trying to hide from it for 10 minutes) was a battle I'll never forget. Likewise when I was riding a Strider and firing arrows into beasts I was attacking (it never even occured to me for half the game to do this), and when I was running up the hills side-by-side with a beast as we simultaneously stalked each other. These moments were AWESOME. I just wish that there were far more of them instead of so few. I longed to side straight down a mountain ala The Man From Snowy River as part of a story mission. I wanted to RIDE those majestic flying beasts. I wanted to be the one who brought down a giant dragon with an arrow to it's weak point like the warrior in The Hobbit to save a city. In other words, I just wish the game were MORE scripted.

So there you have it. This game is a one-trick pony, but it does it's trick very, VERY well. It's not the best game of the year (that's the future legend Nier:Automata), but it is definitely the new poster child for the Playstation 4, and certainly the most popular game for the console at this time. I think if you can forgive that it does not reinvent as much as polish many popular elements of game design (except for the areas I pointed out), and especially if you have not played all the games that it's stealing design elements from (especially those that did it better), you will find a lot to love about this game. As for me, I'll play this game when I get the urge to play a game like Skyrim, but want a beautiful, colorful world and strong, beautiful female protagonist (with a running commentary) instead of a dark, grey, depressing world that reminds me of winters at home...",may notic didnt say greatest wont argu horizon zero dawn isnt absolut gorgeou wont argu isnt polish game ive ever play also frustratingli qualiti game ever play make interest certain level realli realli enjoy analyz thing interest skyrim mass effect arkham citi primal lot peopl dont see connect game skyrim mass effect arkham citi farcryprim clear see got focu mimic detect vision hunter vision altern hud overlay highlight certain thing got mass effect convers wheel silent takedown upgrad slightli ye there endless icon clutter map locat sidequest travel fasttravel system even dungeon excus cauldron featur switch flip overpow bos slay ye game wear inspir sleev first impress game mass effectandromeda new world set distant futur blend scienc fiction primit surviv great idea enjoy fight life whether enjoy game realli go come one question enjoy combat dont arent go like game likelihood peopl seem moon combat reason love notch arrow shoot weak point sneak enemi perform stealth kill thwack robot dinosaur,1514851200,4

This one is far less glitch, and most problems can be traced back to my garbage internet connection then anything game side.

The major complaint I have is that you get experience instead of coins for your actions like the first game.  I feel they should have just done both......BUT, after you gain 10 levels, you upgrade the character and get 20,000 coins.  Not sure how much XP it takes to get 10 levels, but it's got to be semi comparable.  The downside is.......you can only upgrade each guy 6?? times I believe.  The positive is there are over 110 different characters you can unlock and level up, and by the time you are done leveling up the guys the game gives you by default, you'll have half the other characters unlocked.  So it's a different approach that I think could've just been made simpler by allowing characters to level up and you get coins equal to the experience you were earning, no matter where you were earning it.",like first littl better im give one better rate one far le glitch problem trace back garbag internet connect anyth game side major complaint get experi instead coin action like first game feel done bothbut gain 10 level upgrad charact get 20000 coin sure much xp take get 10 level got semi compar downsid isyou upgrad guy 6 time believ posit 110 differ charact unlock level time done level guy game give default youll half charact unlock differ approach think couldv made simpler allow charact level get coin equal experi earn matter earn,1514851200,5

52233,7464,3781,"I remember playing Super Mario Brothers the first year it was out on the NES, it is amazing to think that all these years later the series continues to find new ways to stay fresh. Then I look at a franchise like Gears of War that has only been around since 2006 and it's amazing to think how how far the series has fallen off the rails.  I've had a similar experience with the Halo franchise, another series that started out so strong and is a shell of it's former self.

There is no doubt that the visual fidelity of the game looks outstanding on the Xbox One X (as does Halo 5) but that is where the praise ends for me.  At the end of the day it just isn't a fun game.  The mechanics feel a bit wonky, the story is non-existent and the DeeBees are quite possibly the worst enemy type I've come across in the last few years of gaming, really awful addition.

Many accessories for it too. I chose this over the switch solely for the fact that the switch doesn't have many games for it. But when it does I will be getting that.

52296,4303,1842,"So far, so good. I like it a lot more than the first FFTA and a lot less than the PS1 original (which seems to be the common thread, going by the other reviews up here.) I'll make a short one:

The Good-

+The graphics and music are really good in this game. Things are pretty crisp and you can tell who's who. That's the most important aspect of any game's graphics I believe. Each spell or attack has its own animation. There's random weather effects like rain as well. Even every item has its own little graphical icon (a lost art!). The character portraits though really take the cake and they look awesome.

+The presentation is amazing! No, really I can't stress this enough. Everything is laid out in an incredible way, the fonts are cool and colored, everything basically has an option to view a help tip pop up, etc. The menus are great. This game is super polished. Very well done.

+The customization- while not prefect- is really deep. You learn abilities by equipping weapons and fighting with them, then you can ditch those weapons if you want and put on others to learn new skills. Master enough skills to qualify for more jobs and change classes (ex. a soldier, white mage, etc). You can choose what gear you want to wear and yes that includes being able to equip two shields if you so wanted.

+Game progression. I don't mind that this story isn't super at all. In fact, I like how it kind of drops your little band of adventurers into a big world and lets them go from side mission to side mission all the live long day. KIND OF reminds me a bit of the Grudgebringer mercenary army from the old Warhammer PS1 games.

The Bad-

-The law system from the first FFTA is back, though it's been changed. I don't mind most of the changes however some of the rules that you can't break and are out of your control are poor game design. For example if a law says ""Don't use Ice magic or attacks"" that's cool, I can adjust my battle strategy accordingly and take other weapons or use different spells to defeat the enemy. However if you get a law like ""Don't miss"" that's just stupid. If you attack an enemy with a 97%+ chance to hit you will be shocked to see that you DO miss a hell of a lot over time. Also there's a law that says ""No ranged attacks"" which OK that's cool- No magic spells or bow attacks from far away right? Sort of. See in this game if you score a critical hit it automatically pushes the enemy backwards a space. And somehow that qualifies for a ranged attack and you break the law and lose your bonus items. Yep, even if you were standing right next to him and whacked him with a longsword. What???! I mean c'mon now, how hard would that have been to code for a developer with literally millions they can spend on any given title?

-The battle turns for everybody go by too slowly. I can learn to live with it, but each time the game decides to do anything at all it's 3 seconds moving the guy, 3 seconds showing the pop up window, 3 seconds doing the attack animation, 3 seconds of this and that, etc etc. All those seconds will really add up once you realize this game has like 400+ battles to it (!). I realize some of this is probably due to the computer's A.I. however there really should've been an option to increase the turn speed. I've read countless groaning about this very thing in other places and this ruins the game for some people totally.

-The bazaar is bizarre. This is a place that depends on you bringing different pieces of loot (pieces of animal parts, metal chunks, wood and etc you get from killing enemies in battle or winning for quest rewards). So you offer up seemingly random materials and if you're lucky you'll have the option to make a piece of gear which is then sent to the game's shops. And then you'll have to actually GO to the shops to purchase them for gil (money). This is important because without new weapons you won't be able to learn abilities and therefore get access to better job classes. Worse, the loot you get from enemies seems to be totally random. For example I got a turtle shell off a wolf somehow (?)

-It's a minor thing perhaps but does anyone else miss the little random items you could find on the battlefield like me? I know technically-speaking there are chests in some of them you can grab but I like games like Tactics Ogre where you had to burn some grass to get a hidden sword or something underneath.

52314,3577,1663,"I specifically bought this refurbished Rival for the bumpier grip texture. However, the grip came used and you can tell. A major problem with the Steelseries Xai and Rival Vanilla is that the rubber coating/grip has a perfect day one feel which quickly starts wearing away. The feet are also not rounded from the center like you should see on a brand new Rival Vanilla(they are slightly round at the edge compared to the Rival 300's flat skate). Further, the left click feels too tight and could be enough of a problem on its own.

I also got to point out this strange bug I didn't yet solve that was referenced in another review:
""Mouse can't tell the difference between single left click and middle click. 9 out of 10 times when single left clicking chrome tabs, it thinks im hitting the middle click to close the tab. Will be getting a replacement, or refund for different.""

So, I am disappointed I didn't buy brand new and haven't seen a review touch on any of these refurbished product issues. Also, Steelseries is releasing a Rival 300S to replace the Rival 300, but I guess I still hold nostalgia for the bumpy grip on the Rival Vanilla and round-from-the-center feet.",specif bought refurbish rival bumpier grip textur howev grip came use tell major problem steelseri xai rival vanilla rubber coatinggrip perfect day one feel quickli start wear away foot also round center like see brand new rival vanillathey slightli round edg compar rival 300 flat skate left click feel tight could enough problem also got point strang bug didnt yet solv referenc anoth review mous cant tell differ singl left click middl click 9 10 time singl left click chrome tab think im hit middl click close tab get replac refund differ disappoint didnt buy brand new havent seen review touch refurbish product issu also steelseri releas rival 300 replac rival 300 guess still hold nostalgia bumpi grip rival vanilla roundfromthecent foot,1515024000,1

52400,4142,4320,"A near perfect game. Honestly one of the best I've played, but more so for it's gorgeous world and fun gameplay and less for it's somewhat predictable plot. But as much as I love it, there was something that I couldn't avoid noticing.

After completing the game, I found it strange that I could not recall a single bad/evil female character except for some of the faceless bandits that you fight and one of the three matriarchs that rule Aloy's tribe. You come across countless despicable individuals throughout the main and side quests and most if not all of them are males. The men who aren't bad are usually weak in some way, often by being timid, drunken good-for-nothings or psychotic. The female characters however are practically flawless.

There is a particular moment where the Sun King (possibly the most powerful man in the game) offers Aloy a position by his side, one that was held by another strong female. For some reason she takes offense to this to such a degree that the Sun King has to apologize immediately and then later beg her forgiveness at the end of the game.

(Spoiler)There are also several scenes that take place in the past where men are exclusively shown in a bad way. One is shown to be responsible for humanity's near extinction (and is berated by a woman for it...understandably), one is responsible for destroying a large collection of knowledge (created by a woman coincidently), one basically convinces all of humanity to kill themselves believing in a false hope and another who is responsible for creating an evil AI happens to like torture porn. All admittedly interesting character flaws, but none shared by any of the females. Even the evil Hades AI is male while the good and pure Gaea AI is female. (/spoiler)

Despite these eye brow raisers, I absolutely loved the game and would recommend it to anyone.

52469,751,4260,"It has been just over 10 years since The Witcher PC game hit the scene and won the hearts of players and critics alike. The series has had two main game sequels, a card game spinoff, and some expansion/DLC packs. Playing through Witcher 3 and 2 was a delight, but is the first game as amazing as it was when it first was released? Lets find out.

How does it look?

Your first impression when starting this game is the graphics. I would say that the models/textures are somewhere between PS1 and PS2 quality. That is pretty rough considering PS3 games were delivering much more impressive character models and textures over a year earlier. (this game came out in the tail end of 2007) Now the enhanced  version looked to help clean up some of the rougher animations and textures, but I still find them to be weak overall. The graphics are so off putting to some gamers, that additional third party mods were created in order to bump the graphics up a tad more. Graphics are definitely not this games strong suit. (CON)

How does it run?

This game is not demanding at all. It requires less than 2 gigs of ram and any modern CPU and GPU will have more than enough juice to run it. Heck, you could probably get this bad boy installed on a 200$ laptop. I haven't run into any frame rate issues, freezes, crashes, or other glitches that may impair gaming experience.  (PRO)

How does it control?

This one is a little tricky to explain. It has an isometric cam angle, much like Diablo II, but it doesnt control like Diablo 2. D2 was basically a 2D game on a flat grid, but The Witcher needs to move in 3D and the camera fights you constantly. Turning around can be a real chore and sometimes it seems like my clicking on enemies doesnt register. You can control movement with ASWD and mouse (like WoW) but it isn't as smooth. If The Witcher had WoW controls and action bar, I think the experience would be much better (CON)

How much fun is it?

If you can get into the clunky controls and enjoy the narrative, you will have a pretty fun time. You will probably be more forgiving of the outdated controls and graphics if you are coming from the newer games (like me) It is nice seeing the roots of your favorite characters (Triss, Lambert, Eskel, etc) Struggling through the game to get more back story makes it worth it to me (PRO)

How much does it cost?

You can get this game for less than $10.00 out in the wild OR you can subscribe to GOGs newsletter (just need an email address) and you can get the game for FREE. Cant beat that. Free game really makes a lot of the issues feel a lot less terrible. (PRO)

Additional Thoughts?

The talent/skill tree is a little over complicated and overwhelming. Your main stats (strength, stamina, etc) have three different branches to upgrade (bronze, silver, gold) and THOSE  branches have two separate level upgrades. This is also true for sign strength, steel sword, and silver sword. The layout just doesnt work with everything spread so far apart and hidden under other menus. Back to Diablo 2, its presentation was much cleaner and easier to understand

Potions can only be taken while meditating, so no popping potions in the heat of battle like Witcher 3.

Looting enemy corpses can be a little hit or miss. Sometimes I can target the area to get their loot, sometimes I cannot

Bottom Line/Recommendation?

This game looks dated and plays dated. The story is where The Witcher series really shines. Going back to this style of game play after playing 2 and 3 is rather hard and can frustrate more casual gamers, but I think it is worth checking out just to see the roots of this great series. I would say for hardcore fans, this is a no brainer to pick up. For more casual players, I would recommend checking out some youtube videos and seeing if this game is for you.",10 year sinc witcher pc game hit scene heart player critic alik seri two main game sequel card game spinoff expansiondlc pack play witcher 3 2 delight first game amaz first releas let find look first impress start game graphic would say modelstextur somewher ps1 ps2 qualiti pretti rough consid ps3 game deliv much impress charact model textur year earlier game came tail end 2007 enhanc version look help clean rougher anim textur still find weak overal graphic put gamer addit third parti mod creat order bump graphic tad graphic definit game strong suit con run game demand requir le 2 gig ram modern cpu gpu enough juic run heck could probabl get bad boy instal 200 laptop havent run frame rate issu freez crash glitch may impair game experi pro control one littl tricki explain isometr cam angl much like diablo ii doesnt control like diablo 2 d2 basic 2d game flat grid witcher need move 3d camera,1515369600,3

52478,2136,4402,"I love this game. It is VERY reminiscent of System Shock 1 & 2, as well as the Dead Space & Bioshock franchises (which were all also homages or spiritual successors to System Shock). Great character progression systems and mysterious circumstances kept me thoroughly invested in the plot. Well-done microgravity segments (referred to by most people erroneously as zero-gee) and the ability to fly, if you will, completely around the space station exterior to reach other areas are fun additions. The station is completely open-world, assuming you have the keycard/code/necessary movement ability to reach the various different decks, and you may travel between them at will once able. Id love more games like this.

The only negatives I have to list are the occasional glitches, mostly in the sound, none of which were of any impact on the game. Very rarely an enemy would become trapped in a wall or floor, but these were just random mobs in my experience and were not necessary to advance the game. I enjoyed this game so much that I played it not only on PS4 but also PC, and as far as Bethesda titles go, its quite low on the glitch count lol.

Many people would berate me for saying that but I truly feel that way. I enjoyed this game more than I anticipated I would, probably because there was so much negativity following this title.

Why the negativity? My belief is die hard fans are subconsciously discouraged due to the lack of Shepard. Don't get me wrong, I love Shepard and the series but I won't allow that to hinder future titles.

Like all Mass Effect titles, Andromeda is a story driven & action packed role playing game. Immersion is strong with this one. Theres tons of dialogue, lore, flavor, combat, skills, research/development, planets to explore, objects to scan. Combat is fluid and interesting. Graphics are great in most cases, sometimes up close it's a little distorted. Scenery and cutscenes are breathtaking. There's only 1 downside I've found, framerate decreases in few areas.

I guarantee we will all enjoy games more if we keep an open mind. Don't start a game with reservations. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, you don't.

52566,4665,3910,"I have been playing Civ since it was a board game.  Civ II was one of those games where I would pay just one more turn until four in the morning.  Civ III was fun.  Civ IV had nice graphics but the gameplay was a little slow.  Civ V was really slow and overly complicated, but still playable although somewhat tiresome.  Civ VI is a waste of time.  It is slow to load and slow to play.  The control interface is annoying.  The choices presented are obscure, and the configurations you have to choose are awkward.
I have seen this before.  A very good game becomes wildly successful.  The marketeers and accountants start making design decisions, and add bells and whistles just to sell a new version or a new expansion.  The creative people who love to play the game are overruled or fired by robots who will do as they are told.
And then there is ""Steam"".  I don't know what that does except provide a billboard to advertise other slow boring games.

52578,373,4433,"I'm a casual gamer. Especially when it comes to fighting games. I suppose what frustrated me personally with fighting games on the console, and PC was that it didn't feel like the arcade. I mulled around with the thought of getting a fight stick one day--checking reviews and reading about what 0players recommended. Then I came across this gem: the Mayflash F500. This was exactly the entry-level fighting stick that I was looking for. This fight stick has got me excited in my playing fighting games again! It really does make a difference what kind of controller you use.

One of the things that piqued my interest with this particular fight stick, was that reviews were saying it was designed with the casual gamer in mind. That sounded perfect for me. I'm a casual gamer, and I needed something that would get me startedand it wouldn't break my wallet. I'm happy to report that the Mayflash F500 is remarkable for my fighting game needs. It has great weight to it, thanks to a solid metal bottom. It also has a nice plexiglass protective cover (not shown on the Amazon webpage), for smooth movement of my hand/fingers over the top.

One of the attractive features of the Mayflash F500 has been it's functionality across multiple platforms too. For me at least, seeing a fight stick work on PS3, PS4, X360, XB1, Android, and PC is phenomenal! I'm mainly a PS4 gamer, and it's been working great on that console with Street Fighter V (SFV). One caveat though, a console controller needs to be plugged into a front USB port of the Mayflash F500--in order for the fight stick to work on the corresponding console. This isn't really a big deal for me personally, because I have a 6-foot USB cable, and I simply lay my PS4 controller out is the way... so it doesn't interfere with my space. It would've been nice that the port was placed in the back of the unit though, instead of the front, because I find it does get slightly in my way when I have it in my lap.

I've played with the Mayflash F500 with the stock buttons and joystick for about a week, to see if I liked them. While the buttons are responsive and work well, they can be quite loud when button mashing. Overall this isn't even a major problem, but your selections will be quite audible to you and those around you.

The joystick that comes with the Mayflash F500 is okay. This joystick isn't the most responsive one I've used, and I've found that it has a lot of play in-between the micro-switches... and wiggle room (as I like to call it). Up/Down/Left/Right definitely takes some some effort to move out of the dead zone. I've found that the distance from the dead zone to contact with the micro-switches caused delays in my fighting movements in SFV (for example); I would miss some jumps or special moves a lot. The joystick is mounted to a 4-way square gate on it's bottom, and thankfully the Mayflash F500 comes with an a replacement 8-way octagonal gate. I immediately replaced the 4-way gate with the 8-way gate in order to get a better locked-in range.

The amazing thing about this fighting stick so far has been the choice for me to mod it. After a week of playing with the fight stick with stock inputs, I was able to get an idea of what I wanted--and what I was better looking for. As a teenager growing up the 1980's I frequented public arcades whenever I could. I got used to those style of arcade machines, and their joystick movements (e.g. tension, range, feel). Thankfully there are a multitude of replacement parts available online, and I've been able to mod my Mayflash to my liking now... and I'm absolutely loving it.

I want to say that the Mayflash F500 is a fine fighting stick all on it's own. How it's built, designed, and plays is excellent. This is certainly a decent fight stick. I love it's weight, it's mod-ability, and it's overall size and feel. It's clean, neat, and compact--it doesn't take up a lot of space on my desk or lap. For anyone starting out looking for an entry-level fight stick like me, I encourage you to try the Mayflash F500 out. I think you'll be pleased with it, until you decide to double-down on a more expensive stick down the road. I know that I'm glad that I got this, and I'll be passing it down to my daughter when I finally make the jump to a $300 fight stick down the road.

==============================
Addendum:

For those wondering what I replaced the stock buttons and joystick with, I went with Sanwa Denshi. Although Amazon has some great replacement parts available here on it's website, you'll need to go to places like Arcade Shock or Focus Attack to find more variety and choices. I was able to change my ball top on the joystick with a bat top style. I was also able to find colored buttons, and I mimicked the color scheme of the PS4 controller inputs. I was also able to find sound dampeners that I could stick in each button, to quiet down my intense button mashing. The choices for customizing are endless. Have fun, and happy gaming!

52582,4379,4437,"I enjoyed this game immensely when it first came out on PlayStation 2, but was a little reluctant to play the whole game over again because of its density. I pulled the trigger and picked up the game while it was on sale, and am extremely glad I did so. The game is still as enjoyable as ever, and with the time elapsed since my last playthrough I feel like the story is still fresh and exciting. The improvements made by Square Enix are extremely welcome. The graphical overhaul makes the game look amazing, even at 12 years old. The ability to fast forward (at either 2x or 4x) at the push of a button is great for getting through some of the more dragged-out sequences, especially grinding for loot or experience. The fast-forward works surprisingly well in tandem with the semi-automated gambit battle system, as you can carefully craft your battle plan through setting up gambits and let the characters take care of combat after that. I am especially grateful that the game now contains an auto-save feature. I have vivid memories of frantically searching for save points when I had to stop playing the game, or leaving it running if I couldn't find one but had to leave. I am glad that the portion of 2006 that needed save points is done, even if they still existing in this game.

I am excited to be able to re-experience this unique chapter of my favorite video game series in a way that feels both familiar and fresh at the same time.

One of the best aspects of the game is the gameplay. The game is a hack and slash, very similar to the Devil May Cry or Bayonetta series. One of the more surprising aspect of the game is how you have different types of battles. For example, when you start the game, you're playing a aerial flying mecha style shoot em up. The game switches into a third person action game, and at one point you're playing a side scrolling hack and slash. The variety of game styles that are thrown your way keep the game exciting and fresh.

The story is also fun and interesting. The best part of the game has to be it's MANY endings. Throughout each play through and ending, you get to see the story from different perspectives. The alone made me want to beat the game repeatedly.

The music and sound are TOP-NOTCH! The soundtrack is captivating.

As mentioned before, the replay value is most definitely evident. The game even tells you when you beat it the first time to keep playing it.

All in all, an excellent game. One of the best in 2017.

52633,2633,78,"I feel like I'm being real generous here with 2 stars. (Review Updated below)
Overall the mouse is great. Awesome sensor and I love the different thumb grips you could use. The only thing which absolutely KILLS this mouse for me, it's huge. The lighting on it, it gets Warm/hot. Everything on it. Even if you turn the Logo RGB and side RGB off, the DPI lights still make the mouse get hot. It makes it extremely uncomfortable to use. Your hand is directly on top of these lights, which makes my hand get sweaty and just plain uncomfortable. I really want to like this mouse, but how it gets warm/hot is a big no-no.

Paying this much for a mouse, especially coming from Corsair I'd expect it to be high quality. Like I said, it is a good mouse. If it didn't get hot like it does, this would be perfect. I'm extremely disappointed with this purchase and contemplating trading this mouse out, if it's not too late. I'm probably stuck with it though. So I either have to shell out another $50+ for a different mouse or live with it.

UPDATE as if 6/10/18: Mouse randomly has begun to start ""Double Clicking"" like others have mentioned. Extremely annoying. Lowering my rating from a two-star to one now.

52647,2588,1447,"This keyboard, while featuring backlighting and Razer Green switches, which are as close to Cherry MX Blue in terms of feel as you can get, has a couple of major faults. The first is that the default, and unchangeable, lighting mode is ""breathing"", which cycles the lighting on and off at an interval. This is fine if you have the Razer software installed as you can change it, but if you do not, there is no way to change it to a constant backlight.

That was the minor annoyance. The main problem is longevity, which in my case was just over one year. The 'E' key on my board does not respond half the time, and as the warranty is only a year, there is no way to fix it, so I'm left with a $99 hunk of metal. Save your money and look for another keyboard which uses Cherry MX switches.",keyboard featur backlight razer green switch close cherri mx blue term feel get coupl major fault first default unchang light mode breath cycl light interv fine razer softwar instal chang way chang constant backlight minor annoy main problem longev case one year e key board respond half time warranti year way fix im left 99 hunk metal save money look anoth keyboard use cherri mx switch,1515715200,1
52648,8442,4076,"As a self-proclaimed ""huge"" fan of the Final Fantasy series, I must say, that XV, after all the wait, did not live up to the hype. The game itself was called Final Fantasy XIII vs. I think many years back when Square Enix was trying to milk Final Fantasy XIII for all its worth.

First off, for me, the Final Fantasy series has not been the same since XII... I still consider that the last good Final Fantasy of the high-def era of gaming. For me, nothing will ever come close to Final Fantasy VI (III in the US), but I digress.

I purposely did not read any reviews on it, so I just bought the game since it was a Final Fantasy game...

So I'll start with the gameplay itself. It leaves behind the turn based system of yesteryear. It has more a hack and slash feel to it. There are some new dynamics to the game such as having three computer controlled teammates fighting alongside you in real time. You can still input your own commands when you want. Battles are set to an aggro system that's pretty similar to the one found in Final Fantasy XII. After each battle, you gain experience, and you can allocate where you would like your experience to go.

The visuals of the game are beautiful. From the setting to the character, the character designers and animators have done a great job in creating a game that draws you into the world.

The music and sound are 'okay.' You have some of the familiar sounds from previous entries. However, none of the music is as memorable as when Nubou Uematsu was composing music for it.

The story is where the game falls short for me. I have always played Japanese RPG's for their epic stories... the story for this game is well, a little uneventful, unpolished, and just uninteresting at times... That's the part that disappointed me the most.

The replay value is non-existent in this game. Once I beat it (very quickly, almost speed-run quickly) it began to collect dust.

All in all, an 'okay' entry into the series. I will be honest, even if you are a fan of the Final Fantasy series, I would say avoid this one, and go buy Persona 5 instead. Or save your money for the new Dragon Quest...

This could have been expanded a lot and fro those looking for an in-depth multiplayer experience, this game does not offer that at all.

Pro:
Sound is amazing!
Being able to charge on a base is really cool
A50 modkit is mandatory

Cons:
Getting them positioned on the base is extremely frustrating. Half the time you spend 30 seconds wiggling them around to get them to charge.
The sound cuts out randomly (even at full charge) with the base stand about 3 ft away from the headset.
Dolby surround enables on every reconnect
No software instructions in the box
The death blow: Extreeeeme battery drain when turned off and not on the base.

Explanation:
So this is repeatable. I can turn off the headset, try to put it on the charger, it doesnt want to start charging so i say screw it and put it on my desk. I come back 30 mins later, turn on the headset and its at 1%.

This happens all the time. How is it possible? It was at 3 bars of battery when I turned it off.

52798,6477,1745,"(Note: I've posted a truncated version of this review on the game's steam store page)

[h1]Hitman Absoltuion is in the odd position of being a great stealth shooter, but a bad Hitman game.[h1]

It seems that the entire game was rebuilt from the ground up using the typical third person shooter template as it's basis, and then adding select Hitman mechanics on top of it, as opposed to taking the existing Hitman formula and revamping it. You can still take disguises, garrot people, toss people over ledges, drag bodies, hide bodies, and sneak up on people to take them out, but that's about it. While that sounds like a lot in common with other Hitman games, it's markedly different in practice, playing more like an action shooter that lets you use stealth, rather than a primarily stealth game (although admittedly earlier titles did blur the line quite a bit themselves).

[h1]To start off with, the game adds several mechanics that I like, and that do feel like they'd be very fitting in a more traditional Hitman game:[/h1]

* The traditional Third-Person cover system is here. I don't think you'd need this much for shooting in the older Hitman titles, but it is nice to press up against the wall and have a more neatly small profile

* After using the garrote wire, you can drag the bodies with it, which is super slick and handy

* Standing near bodies makes you suspicious, this is a great adition that always felt like an oversight in older games.

* Tossing objects to distract guards finally works like you'd expect it to in a stealth game. The coin toss in Blood Money felt very weak in this regard.

* Instead of Syringes, which were sometimes clunky to use you have a lethal/nonlethal takedown from behind, like in Human Revolution or Arkham Asylum

* The AI does some very cool things. Their ability to check in on things is increased (which means your ability to lure them into a kill also increases) and they have neat little details too, such as popping out of cover at different angles each time, so you can't just put your crosshair where they're going to come out and hit them as soon as they leave cover.

* The ability to fake-surrender to enemies is fantastic. You can use this to lure them away from the rest of the guards, then take them as a human shield (and you can knock them out from this position, making it a good nonlethal option)

* Throwable weapons such as knives are easier to use and lock on to your target

* I like that you have to pick a lock to leave most levels. It might be an extra little nuisance, but it adds tension and makes you have to really make sure you're clear before leaving

[h1]These are all great additions, but the game strips out or changes a lot of mechanics that make Hitman feel like hitman:[/h1]

* Can't look through keyholes anymore (a crucial element)

* Can't close doors manually (another big deal for luring someone away)

* Security cameras are now mere props, they serve no gameplay purpose

* While the lack of syringes lead to the more flexible takedown system, it also means you can't do stealthy stuff like poison your target through their food (although there is one level where this is an option)

* Attacking someone from the front with your hands has been nerfed. In Blood Money, you could run up and disarm people, which was a great mechanic. In Absolution, frontal attacks are replaced with a borderline impossible QTE event, which, when failed, causes you to instantly die. I've only successfully pulled it off once, and if you miss a single of the 5 or 6 commands it asks of you, that's it. You're done.

What really changes the game's dynamic though, is the revamp of the disguises and stealth system. Disguises are nerfed very heavily. If you're disguised in a certain outfit, other characters wearing the same outfit will become suspicious. It's an interesting idea in theory, and it addresses the question of ""why don't they notice a guy with a different face""? But the execution makes me feel like this would have been better left as one of those acceptable videogame breaks from reality. Hitman 2 actually had a similar mechanic, where if you got too close to someone, they'd catch on, but the key word here is close. In Absolution, they catch on from across the room (or at least they do on Expert more, I'm not sure if this changes by difficulty), which means that within seconds of entering a room, you can have your cover blown. They even catch on if 47 is wearing something that completely conceals his face, which I think is just taking it too far. The emphasis then, becomes not so much on hiding in plain sight and planning out your hit, as it is on remaining completely unseen for as long as you can and being ready to react when things go downhill.

The game also has an inconsistent idea of what constitutes ""the same"" outfit. If you take a cop's outfit and the shirt is blue, that counts as the same outfit as a white cop shirt, and in one level there are a bunch of enemies who take over an orphanage, some wearing suits without masks, some wearing suits with masks. If 47 takes one that conceals his whole face, it counts as the same outfit as the one without the mask on that level, but in a later level, you're infiltrating a penthouse with masked SWAT-type guys, and business suit guards, all of whom seem to be working for the same faction, but if you steal the Mask guy's clothes, the Business Suit guards won't catch onto you and you can walk around unopposed until you find another mask guy.

The disguise system also ties into a new mechanic called ""instinct"", a resource which you gain from pacifying and killing enemies, that can be used to ""fool"" enemies of the same clothing into believing your disguise. Problem is, instinct runs out very quickly if you're using it to pass by an enemy. Instinct apparantly has some other properties, such as showing the enemy's walking path and even giving you Arkham-Style x-ray vision, but that's only on lower difficultues and is disabled on Expert. Simply put, you will never have enogh instinct to sneak past all the guards you need to, and at some point in most levels, you will get caught and break into a firefight. Like I said before, the emphasis in absolution is more on not being seen at all and sneaking by people, rather than the disguises themselves, which make the game feel more like a Splinter Cell game at points than hitman.

[h1]With all of this said, the game does actually have some very good gameplay at points, and to really dig into what works about this title, we need to look at the types of levels it has. Unlike older Hitman games, which always drop you into a sandbox with a target and an exit point, this game has several types of levels, all using the same base mechanics, but playing decidedly different from each other due to how each level is designed.[/h1]

* You've got levels that do put you into a small, fairly open sandbox that you can walk around, with a target you're supposed to get. Levels like ""Streets of Hope"" and ""The King of Chinatown"" do feel the closest to classical Hitman gameplay, and they are decent, but at the same time you can't shake the feeling you're playing a stripped down, lesser version of something that was done better six years prior to this game.

* Linear levels that are about getting from Point-A to Point-B, sometimes killing a target or doing an objective on the way, that have multiple types of enemies you can steal (meaning disiguises still have at least a little utility). These ones are interesting, but can become pretty tedious and clunky sometimes. At the same time though, it can be legitimately fun to distract guards enough to slip by them. These were the sort of ""middle-of-the-road"" for me.

* Linear levels where there's only one type of guard and you're trying to get to the end. These ones, despite being the absolute least Hitman-feeling, were the best levels in the game for me. Essentially, because the disguise system is so useless against people wearing the same outfit, and there's only one outfit for you to get, you probably [i]will[/i] get caught and you [i]will[/i] get roped into a firefight. I called these the ""Kill 'em all"" levels, since that's basically the only way you're getting out alive. Essentially the strategy is to take out as many enemies as you can unseen, and then once things go downhill you need to [i]survive[/i]. Playing these missions on expert mode was a revelation, and one of the most satisfyingly hardcore shooter experience I've had. It has that try something/die/repeat loop what Super Meat Boy or Hotline Miami has, where you need to use trial and error to figure out the safest way to get your first couple kills, and as you keep dying and figuring out your strategy, you sort of grow into a mastery of the level, doing a little better each time. Coming up with ways to bait enemies, or setting up traps with proximity mines, or just trying to blind fire in a last desperate bid to get the last three guys, it's all exhillerating. As you build up your instinct, you can pull off a ""point shot"", where you basically freeze time for a few seconds to line up multiple killshots, which is a ridiculous mechanic for a Hitman game, but an excellent mechanic for this hardcore survival shooter. Imagine your favorite cover shooter, but without regenerating health, and you're on the right track. When you finally get that message that says ""clear"" and you just walk around that battlefield without any enemies left, it's an amazing feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. My favorite of these was a vertical mineshaft that gives you quite a bit of interesting vantage points and tools to play with, but really all of the ""Kill 'em All"" levels are a masterpiece of hardcore third-person shooting. I highly reccomend playing on Expert more for the full intesnity of these, there's really nothing quite like it as far as 3D shooters goes. This is where Absolution truly shines and steps into it's own as a stealth shooter and fortunately these seemed to be the most common (or at least the most time consuming)

[h1] Outside of the stealth shooting, there are other things to like as well[/h1]

The story is very interesting this time around. Earlier Hitman games didn't have the most involved plots, but Absolution has a surprisingly character driven story that goes into 47's mind but still feels true to the character. Some may take exception to seeing 47 care about others, but considering the whole plot of Hitman 2 was that he had to save his preacher, I think it fits, and after having 47 as a bit of a blank slate for the prior two games, a look into him as a character is certainly tantalizing and aspects of the plot reminded me of movies like ""The Killer"" or ""The Professional"". Visually, the game also looks phenominal and performs fantastically, each area feels very detailed and the story informs a lot of the environments and characters that inhabit them, such as a town that's more or less bought and paid for by the main villian's company.

Overall, Hitman Absolution is at its worst when it tries to be a Hitman game, but ironically is amazing at it's least Hitman. The game was apparantly made by the Kane & Lynch team, as opposed to the main IO Hitman team, and it certainly has the feel of something made in a different mindset (and little details like the fact that we actually see what Diana looks like in the games upening seconds kind of belie these production differences) If you're a fan of the series, you'll probably have some mixed feelings on it, and it is somewhat inconsistant, but if you approach the game on it's own terms as a stealth shooter, I think you'll find a lot to like.",note ive post truncat version review game steam store page h1hitman absoltuion odd posit great stealth shooter bad hitman gameh1 seem entir game rebuilt ground use typic third person shooter templat basi ad select hitman mechan top oppos take exist hitman formula revamp still take disguis garrot peopl toss peopl ledg drag bodi hide bodi sneak peopl take that sound like lot common hitman game markedli differ practic play like action shooter let use stealth rather primarili stealth game although admittedli earlier titl blur line quit bit h1to start game add sever mechan like feel like theyd fit tradit hitman gameh1 tradit thirdperson cover system dont think youd need much shoot older hitman titl nice press wall neatli small profil use garrot wire drag bodi super slick handi stand near bodi make suspici great adit alway felt like oversight older game toss object distract guard final work like youd expect stealth game coin toss blood money felt weak regard instead syring sometim clunki use lethalnonleth takedown behind like human,1516147200,4

However. This mouse. Let me tell you. Is AWESOME.It feels designed for my use case, which is: something very good for programming/word processing/browsing, and if so happens needs to belt out some mad FPS or MOBA business: so be it.

The features are great; most of which can be tuned for productivity or leisure. I will start things off by mentioning how seamless the horizontal mouse wheel scroll is: very, very useful for coding! Speaking of the wheel, it can be ""unlocked"" to scroll very fast or ""locked"" to scroll methodically: very legit.

Button placement is awesome. You will not be bumping into things accidentally. There's four customizable ones, a profile changer, and a...RGB button? There's a button that just changes the color temporarily, but it has a crosshair logo on it--I forgot what it does.

Profiles are legit. The software to adjust them is fun to use. I can see how profiles would be very useful for CAD users.

Overall, this mouse is for pretty much anybody, literally. I have to say it was almost on the tier of going from a membrane to mechanical keyboard for me.

And the environment and incredibly awesome combat made it a game that even though was a love/hate relationship at times I will always still cherish playing (I have two BB posters - Lol). Enter SoTFS. Only reasons I played this before trying DS3 was because it was remastered for PS4 and I wanted to get an idea of what DS games were like before BB. My impression? First, even remastered it doesn't look anywhere near as good as BB (or vids I've seen of DS3 for that matter), and second, the early to mid-game bosses are relatively easy compared to BB, I breezed through the first 25 or so bosses pretty quickly, but the levels themselves are completely another story. They are incredibly difficult, to the point of being ridiculously unfair. I've beaten 37 bosses out of 41 total and I have lost WAY more souls than I ever did in BB. Of course, at this point the bosses have dramatically risen in difficulty and I'm currently having to farm souls to level up cause I'm stuck on three of them at the same time. Luckily, the SoTFS made some changes and I found an area that is relatively easy to grind, but the game just seems particularly unfair to the player and I've never played a game that puts so many obstacles in your way to succeeding. It just seems that they were trying too hard to make up for all of the criticisms of the original DS2 and went overboard.

52863,5023,201,"STEAM CHORD

There is a feature on Steam that allows you to have customizable global controls that you can use for things like playing and pausing your music while gaming. This feature does not work well on Bluetooth Xbox One controllers, but it does work very well once you plug in the controller via micro USB to your computer. I found that using this adapter make that feature  work as well as it does when you plug the controller in, except that you can't hold down the Xbox (home) button for more than 6 seconds, because the controller would turn off.

XBOX CONTROLLER AUDIO JACK

This also makes the audio jack work on the controller when you're using it with PC. That audio jack is another thing that doesn't work at all if you use a newer Xbox controller over Bluetooth with a PC.

MUCH FASTER PAIRING!

It took about 3 seconds for the controller to pair with the adapter for the first time, as opposed to 5 to 10 minutes with the Bluetooth controller. I will say that on my Mac, it only takes less than 30 seconds to pair the Bluetooth controller for the first time (or re-pair it).

SORRY MAC GAMERS...

In case there was a glimmer of hope for Mac users out there, I can confirm that this adapter does not work at all on Mac. You can only get an Xbox controller to connect to a Mac by plugging it in via USB or pairing a newer Bluetooth controller to it. Xbox controllers aren't the best controllers for Mac anyway though, since most Mac games don't natively support it.",steam chord featur steam allow customiz global control use thing like play paus music game featur work well bluetooth xbox one control work well plug control via micro usb comput found use adapt make featur work well plug control except cant hold xbox home button 6 second control would turn xbox control audio jack also make audio jack work control your use pc audio jack anoth thing doesnt work use newer xbox control bluetooth pc much faster pair took 3 second control pair adapt first time oppos 5 10 minut bluetooth control say mac take le 30 second pair bluetooth control first time repair sorri mac gamer case glimmer hope mac user confirm adapt work mac get xbox control connect mac plug via usb pair newer bluetooth control xbox control arent best control mac anyway though sinc mac game dont nativ support,1516233600,5

We agreed on an exchange, and though I had to clean the pins in the cartridge slot (no surprise there) the second console works perfectly. Item even shipped with an ascii controller! Very happy. Five stars for the service and ease.

Now, a bits of warning - not about this seller, but in retro consoles, in general. They're old. Expect problems and learn about them. They're time machines and need care. Finding a working SNES period is getting more and more difficult. Know how the machines work, and understand that such fragile systems can be damaged when shipped in ways we can't predict. This seller was amazing about this, and I recieved my replacement within one week. Be patient, and at least know somebody that can work on these old babies; or just check the internet for troubleshooting. Also, some SNESes I've run across are bundled with 9v power supplies. 850ma, but 9v. This will fire up Super Mario World just fine, but any cartridge with extra chips will not get the power they need to run. A SNES requires a 10v power supply. Don't argue it. Buy the right stuff for your gear. And that's it!

52874,4,4499,"I really hate the fact that there is such a mix of products on this Amazon product page. I'm only Reviewing the K51 white keyboard and I've not tried the other products that this review will be mixed up with.

This is sold as a hybrid mechanical keyboard. It feels nothing like a mechanical keyboard. There is no clickiness to it. You press the keys smoothly till they bottom out. They key caps are closer to the style you often find on mechanical keyboards, but this is a membrane keyboard through and through. Membrane keyboards are cheaper and more liquid resistent. I currently have 3 mechanical keyboards and there's no comparison. I'm not saying this is a bad keyboard--but if you want a mechanical, get a mechanical!

That being said, this is a very nice backlit keyboard. I wanted a wired keyboard for the computer the kids use in the living room and I wanted it to be backlit so it can be used when others are watching movies. I also didn't want a mechanical because I wanted a quieter keyboard. This fits all my needs and is a nice keyboard!

Also, I have three girls who LOVE the rainbow colors. You have six different options of different types of motion or two options of solid color. There is barely any customization for the six motion options except you can sometimes change whether it moves right to left or left to right. You can also always change the brightness. All of the motions are too quick for me, but the kids love them.

The two options that aren't motion are solid color all across the keyboard and one where you can program each of the six zones to different colors. I don't think programming the zones to different colors is worth it because if the keyboard is unplugged or the computer is turned off, the settings are all reset. I just use the solid color option myself.

Each key does not have it's own backlight. There are six zones from left to right across the keyboard. This doesn't really matter, but it means you can't just light up wasd or anything like that. The backlight is very bright, so having the zones doesn't cause issues unless you expect to be able to light specific keys only. The good side of that is because it's so simple you don't have software to install, and you can set it however you want with a couple of keystrokes.

The biggest downside is that it doesn't save your settings if power is lost or it's unplugged. Not only that, the default setting is a rainbow motion setting. It would be nice if the default setting was a solid color option, but all I have to do to fix it is to hit ""FN-5"". So it isn't too bad.

Overall, I like it pretty well and my kids love it. We had a pretty boring keyboard before this, but it go messed up by spills over time. I think we're going to get a good life out of this and my kids think the colors are amazing!",realli hate fact mix product amazon product page im review k51 white keyboard ive tri product review mix sold hybrid mechan keyboard feel noth like mechan keyboard clicki press key smoothli till bottom key cap closer style often find mechan keyboard membran keyboard membran keyboard cheaper liquid resist current 3 mechan keyboard there comparison im say bad keyboardbut want mechan get mechan said nice backlit keyboard want wire keyboard comput kid use live room want backlit use other watch movi also didnt want mechan want quieter keyboard fit need nice keyboard also three girl love rainbow color six differ option differ type motion two option solid color bare custom six motion option except sometim chang whether move right left left right also alway chang bright motion quick kid love two option arent motion solid color across keyboard one program six zone differ color dont think program zone differ color,1516233600,4

52901,2839,4484,"I absolutely LOVE open world scifi / fantasy games and this game checks all the right boxes ( for me ) that are needed to make a great game.

Graphics & Art  : This game does not look as impressive graphically as Battlefield One or Battlefront 2, but what you get here is a huge lush open world with many different environments, a Day/Night cycle and is still an absolutely stunning game. The games mentioned above are very very good looking games but they are hardly on the scale of Elex  those games are a very linear type of game and Elex is HUGE and sprawling RPG. It is an absolute joy to just get off the beaten path of your current mission and just explore the Environment/World. I just can't say enough about the art style and graphics, while not the absolute best they are still STUNNING to look at and even more fun to just explore this beautiful world that the developers have created for us to lose ourselves in.

Gameplay : If you are familiar with open world RPG games of this type you will be at home here. The fighting is similar to Skyrim/Oblivion, the Gothic series and Risen. Strike, block, roll, dodge and strike again or sometimes just run away because you may be dealing with an enemy that is overpowered for your current power level. There are other ways to fight as well, unlike some of the previously mentioned games, Elex will allow you to use swords, guns and magic, or a combination of all, and this is one factor that makes this game special and stand out from the rest. You will be told you need to join a faction at the beginning of the game, but in reality you can wait, level up and decide later which one fits your play style the best. This game can be brutal at times, it simply does not hold your hand and leaves it up to the player to figure some things out. There are times your enemy will two hit you and kill you just that fast, and others where you can just pummel them. You need to be tactical about the way you approach a fight, think about ranged attacks, sneaking or even close combat, but be prepared for the fight you are getting yourself into. Make sure you are equipped with enough health regeneration materials, mana regeneration resources or any other consumables you may need, Also make sure you use your skill upgrades wisely.

Voice acting & Sound : The Voice acting in this game is over all well done, the main character ( You ) can seem dry at times but is over all acted well enough. The NPC's in the game are also voice acted well and are most times better than the character you control, but like I said before the voice for your character is just fine and adequate. I've played many RPG's where your character is voiceless, so I really can't find any fault here at all.

Now on to the sounds within the game. It's very, very well done, from the sounds of you running through the grass, asphalt, snow, sand or anything else, it seems authentic and real, to the wind or rain pattering on the ground, it all just seems right on target.

Conclusion : This is over all an amazing game. It's absolutely huge with vast amounts of things to do and places to explore. It can be challenging at times so remember to save your game frequently, and in doing so when you die ( And you will ) you won't get set back to far at all. As a matter of fact the game lets you save at absolutely any point in the game you want, even during a fight ( Although I don't recommend it ). This game is just full of wonder and beautiful sights to see along with and interesting story line and characters it makes for a must play game.

52937,324,327,"I bought this mouse for light weight and scroll durability. Given that it comes with the still-competitively-viable 3310 sensor, dual RGB and an ALPS scroll wheel, this mouse was a shoe-in to try at $25 bucks.

Weight: 75 grams
Length: 10.8 cm
Width: 5.8cm
Grip Width: Roughly 4.8cm

Sensor: 3310. Tracking is good and combined with the light weight, this mouse feels very responsive and ""pointable.""

Build Quality: Exceptionally solid. No rattles. UV coated plastic on the top, octogonal patterned hard plastic on the sides. Grip is serviceable, but not because of the plastic as much as the shape and light weight involved. This is a mouse that I think would take a lot of time to break.

Ergonomics: This mouse is definitely best for smaller hands and/or claw/fingertip users. It is about the size of a G203, but the front narrows down pretty rapidly to the point that it feels like the generic G203 and the diamond-shaped G303 had a baby. To hold the mouse the way it ""wants"" to be held, you have to move your hand forward according to the curvature given to the thumb/ring finger, and that makes it quite rear-heavy when picking it up. If I didn't want the rear-end to plop, I had to squeeze that little bit more. What I found out in most grip styles is that this resulted in a slightly crampy feeling that was more uncomfy than the G303, but nothing that caused pain or anything like that.

Buttons: Two thumb, two primary, middle click. There is no DPI button on top, which is a minor negative. The primary clicks are medium pressure, likely because of one-piece shell design involved. Primary clicks are good with only slight pre and post travel. As someone who rests the index./middle fingers very close to the scroll, I didn't care for the subtle comfort grooves being set so far to the outer edges. Pressing the primary keys  meant applying pressure to a small bump, a very minor thing leading to slight annoyance over time. The thumb buttons both have good tactility but have a high degree of pre and post travel, making them feel like the flimsiest part of a very sturdy product.

Scroll: Moderate resistance, good detents, moderate force for middle click with a tendency to accidentally scroll. The scroll feels really good, second only to the Roccat Kone Pure in my experience BUT. Yes, there's a BUT. Using this mouse for CSGO a lot, I use the scroll to quickscope. What I found is that a move to the next detent does noooot always correspond to a response from the mouse. On multiple occasions I would try to quickscope by flicking the mousewheel, getting the nice, tactile feedback but nothing would happen. By itself, this is not a dealbreaker, it is worth taking half a star off.

Software: The software works, but it is a con, this is another half-star deduction. It is very basic and there is no working product registration for US customers. The software also seems to be buggy. Settings don't always take when you hit apply and the program does not start sometimes - other times it will take 30 seconds to pop up. The game tracking is a pain to set up and is so basic that it really isn't worth making the effort to set up, very disappointed there. This mouse also offers adjustable polling rate, adjustable liftoff distance and stat tracking during gaming sessions. The polling rate is best set at 1000hz, I found the LOD could actually be set TOO low (less than half a DVD), to the point that simply applying more pressure on one side of the mouse would make the cursor read the ""mush"" of the mousepad.

I've tried multiple competitors in the same price range including the Logitech G203, Corsair Harpoon, MSI GM40, Technet M009. They all offer a little something different.  This one offers the lightest weight of the bunch and it is the only one I know to have an ALPS scroll wheel even though I'm not entirely sold that it will be more durable in the long run. It also has the most exotic aesthetics - some people think it looks creep, some people think it looks cool. I don't mind it. Overall, good mouse that seems very responsive and durable with minor gripes regarding ergonomics, scroll response and software.",bought mous light weight scroll durabl given come stillcompetitivelyvi 3310 sensor dual rgb alp scroll wheel mous shoein tri 25 buck weight 75 gram length 108 cm width 58cm grip width roughli 48cm sensor 3310 track good combin light weight mous feel respons pointabl build qualiti except solid rattl uv coat plastic top octogon pattern hard plastic side grip servic plastic much shape light weight involv mous think would take lot time break ergonom mous definit best smaller hand andor clawfingertip user size g203 front narrow pretti rapidli point feel like gener g203 diamondshap g303 babi hold mous way want held move hand forward accord curvatur given thumbr finger make quit rearheavi pick didnt want rearend plop squeez littl bit found grip style result slightli crampi feel uncomfi g303 noth caus pain anyth like button two thumb two primari middl click dpi button top minor neg primari click medium pressur like onepiec shell design involv primari click good slight pre post travel someon rest indexmiddl finger close,1516492800,4

52974,5660,1119,"Oh man, how I wanted to love this game.  I've been a huge fan of the Metroid franchise for as long as I can remember, and Metroid Fusion has a special place in my heart since it recaptured a lot of the raw fun game mechanics of Super Metroid but it was the first (and only) game in the franchise to include any real story (and the telling of that story was amazing!).  I was excited to hear the prequel of these characters from Metroid Fusion.

...and instead I got this game.

The story was really hacky and the characters were totally out-of-character.  I didn't believe Samus's portrayal, and Adam was not even remotely how I imagined him to be based on his portrayal in Metroid Fusion.  Some of the other characters in Samus's squad in that game are kind of cool, but Adam and Samus totally ruined it.  Also, the idea of getting ""authorization"" to use weapons and powerups is not at all believable.  Having done real-world ""mission"" type work (let's leave it at that), you don't immediately handcuff your most valuable asset in a crisis situation.  Totally bogus!  I'd rather them have recycled the ""suit is damaged and malfunctioning"" plot device from all the previous games than subject me to that narrative!

And then there's the gameplay.  To say that the controls on the Wii-mote are frustrating is an understatement!  It is very difficult to effectively target anything for missiles, and constantly swapping the position of the Wii-mote is very annoying and not intuitive.  The ""cutscenes"" where you have to find something are also extremely annoying, as is looking for secret passages in 1st person mode after moving around in little bits.  Slows down gameplay and is not fun.  And the fact that they messed with the core mechanics of how energy and missile recovery work (and that there aren't really any new item pickups) also made the game less fun.  ...and the D-pad is a crappy way to move around in a 3D world.

So in short, don't bother with this game.  Though I'm always sad that Mr. Yokoi was tragically taken from us, it's a small mercy that he didn't have to witness this unfortunate entry to the franchise he started.",oh man want love game ive huge fan metroid franchis long rememb metroid fusion special place heart sinc recaptur lot raw fun game mechan super metroid first game franchis includ real stori tell stori amaz excit hear prequel charact metroid fusion instead got game stori realli hacki charact total outofcharact didnt believ samuss portray adam even remot imagin base portray metroid fusion charact samuss squad game kind cool adam samu total ruin also idea get author use weapon powerup believ done realworld mission type work let leav dont immedi handcuff valuabl asset crisi situat total bogu id rather recycl suit damag malfunct plot devic previou game subject narr there gameplay say control wiimot frustrat understat difficult effect target anyth missil constantli swap posit wiimot annoy intuit cutscen find someth also extrem annoy look secret passag 1st person mode move around littl bit slow gameplay fun fact mess core,1516579200,2

52986,133,1464,"I feel like this was overall a good purchase. Despite being my first mechanical keyboard, I really wanted one with linear switches after typing on a coworker's and I also wanted one with RGB backlighting and one of good quality. I decided this looked like the best bang for the buck. It may be overkill for me since I use it at work as a software engineer rather than at home for gaming, but it feels really good to type on. I love the lack of resistance and I can tell it is made very well.

(See update regarding the following complaints.)

I only have two complaints. The wrist rest that came with it is terrible. It is way too low and I basically don't use it. The software also leaves a lot to be desired. The effects it offers are cool, but I wish it offered a little more customization. For instance, I'd love to combine the ""rainbow wave"" effect with the ""type lighting"" effect; what I picture is that when a key is pressed, it lights up white for a couple of seconds and gradually fades back to the rainbow effect. Unfortunately, the options per effect are fairly limited.

Although the software leaves something to be desired, that is not the primary reason I gave it four stars. The primary reason for giving it four stars is the wrist rest. I fee like they could include one that does not taper so much (to the point of being pointless to use) for the price.

Despite that, I love the keyboard and will be purchasing another one for my PC at home when I get a little extra cash to spend.

UPDATE: It turns out you can use more than one effect at the same time! I figured out how to have the white type lighting effect (on key press) on top of the always-on rainbow wave. It took some messing around with it to figure out it, though, and it only works with the effects in a certain order. So, while versatile, the software is still a little difficult to use.

I still don't feel like I am ""5 stars"" in love with it, but I stand by my final verdict: the keyboard is great and I will be purchasing another one.",feel like overal good purchas despit first mechan keyboard realli want one linear switch type cowork also want one rgb backlight one good qualiti decid look like best bang buck may overkil sinc use work softwar engin rather home game feel realli good type love lack resist tell made well see updat regard follow complaint two complaint wrist rest came terribl way low basic dont use softwar also leav lot desir effect offer cool wish offer littl custom instanc id love combin rainbow wave effect type light effect pictur key press light white coupl second gradual fade back rainbow effect unfortun option per effect fairli limit although softwar leav someth desir primari reason gave four star primari reason give four star wrist rest fee like could includ one taper much point pointless use price despit love keyboard purchas anoth one pc home get littl extra cash spend updat turn use one effect time figur,1516579200,4

52998,7442,456,"This was a free download for PS Plus subscribers late last year.  I played Metal Gear Solid for the original Playstation when I was a kid, so figured MGSV would be nostalgic.  It's a decent game, but I only got about 20 hours in before it started to lose me.  Obviously, I did not finish the story, so take my review with a grain of salt.

Pros:
--Realistic AI behavior - they switch up patrol routes, reinforce numbers if they've been attacked and communicate your position to other enemies when they notice you.  They even change tactics depending on how you play.
--Great weapon variety.  You can be a pacifist and take a silent, non-lethal approach, or invest in rocket launchers and go in guns blazing.
--""Buddy"" system is fun and you can call in help, such as air support, to help with certain situations.
--Voice acting is excellent.
--Ability to call in extraction when and where you want adds a great tactical element and makes you feel in control of the mission.  Bug out or stay and finish all optional objectives?  Try to extract directly from a hotzone now or try to make it to a more remote/safer area?
--Huge replayability to get 100% completion and all optional objectives.
--Still looks very good for a 2015 release.

Cons:
--Story is convoluted.  I know people revere Kojima's storytelling but TBH if you (like me) haven't played the other installments you will probably have no idea what is going on.  This does not have to be the case - for example Witcher 3 did a great job of telling a self-contained story that was easy for new players to follow.
--Huge learning curve and this game is downright HARD at times.  Barely anything in the way of in-game tutorials.
--There are no difficulty settings and every mission is scored based on completion time.  I felt like I needed to be pounding energy drinks to get through a mission with a passable score.
--The main villains and even some recurring enemies have supernatural powers.  This in the older games too, but I feel like it's over the top in MGSV.  Is this tactical espionage action or X-Men?
--Some of the humor seems out of place.  In an otherwise gritty narrative, it was weird to be airlifting sheep and launching enemies into the air with inflatable balloons.  IDK I guess this is part of the unique Metal Gear style.
--The open world is a nice touch but it's pretty lifeless.  Everything on the map is part of a mission objective at some point.  Why aren't there a few random villages that AREN'T overrun with enemy soldiers?

Conclusion: It's best in class for the genre, and definitely worth a playthrough.  Especially if you picked it up in the PS Plus month or at a discount.  That said, the hype is a bit overdone IMO (it was near universal GOTY in 2015) and I would have liked to see some difficulty options to make it a bit more accessible.",free download p plu subscrib late last year play metal gear solid origin playstat kid figur mgsv would nostalg decent game got 20 hour start lose obvious finish stori take review grain salt pro realist ai behavior switch patrol rout reinforc number theyv attack commun posit enemi notic even chang tactic depend play great weapon varieti pacifist take silent nonleth approach invest rocket launcher go gun blaze buddi system fun call help air support help certain situat voic act excel abil call extract want add great tactic element make feel control mission bug stay finish option object tri extract directli hotzon tri make remotesaf area huge replay get 100 complet option object still look good 2015 releas con stori convolut know peopl rever kojima storytel tbh like havent play instal probabl idea go case exampl witcher 3 great job tell selfcontain stori easi new player follow huge learn curv game downright hard time bare anyth way ingam tutori difficulti,1516579200,3

53001,520,4499,"I am a big fan of mechanical keyboards and was interested to check out this pseudo mechanical membrane switch hybrid keyboard. So I will talk about that first. This keyboard is decently weighted, and doesn't feel too cheap when holding it or typing on it. The keys have some resistance like a mechanical keyboard, but there is no click and not as much tactile feel as a brown switch. I would put the feel somewhere between a brown and red Cherry switch if I had to describe it. I am just going to be honest and say I actually like the way it feels. I am absolutely NOT a fan of membrane switches, but I'm also not a fan of Cherry red switches. They are fine for gaming but I have a lot of trouble typing with those switches. with these weird mechanical membrane switches, I have no trouble typing at a decent speed, and they work fine for gaming as well.

The keycaps are not MX style, and as far as I can tell, they are some proprietary style made by Rosewill. I don't really love the font on the keycaps, it's similar to a lot of ""gaming"" keyboards and it just looks silly to me but I can see why some people would like the ""futuristic"" look of the font. The keycaps are easily removable, so you could change them if you can find a replacement set of keys. All the keys seem to be the standardized size and layout of a regular full size 104 key keyboard.

The LEDs are outrageously bright and crazy, but of course you can turn them off or tone them down. There are several patterns to choose from, from Rainbow to solid color, and there is even a custom setting where you can program groups of lights. It's very basic so if you are looking for a lot of customization, you aren't going to find it from this keyboard. If you unplug the keyboard or turn the power supply off, your setting will reset, so there is no memory. If your motherboard keeps its power on (like if your mouse light stays on when your computer is off) then it will keep it's setting. I found that it just takes a second to set my preferred color once I plug it in, so it's not a big deal for me. The light really shines brightly from under the keys and the lower part of the keyboard. It's quite bright and colorful and I actually really like how the lights look on this keyboard, the lack of programming is the main downside. If you are not into LED lights, this probably isn't the keyboard for you. Yes, you can turn them off, but there are less expensive keyboards with real mechanical switches that don't have the crazy LED lights. I am reviewing the white model keyboard, and I think it looks great with the LEDs because it reflects the light better than black.

The keyboard comes with a plastic wrist rest thing that just sits under the front of the keyboard. It stays in place as long as you don't move the keyboard. I can't use it, because I guess I move my keyboard around a lot when gaming and didn't realize it. But for typing a lot of text, it can be nice for your wrists. The bottom of the keyboard has 2 legs that swing down to raise the back up, and the USB cord is not removable. The keyboard has the standard built in functions for Windows, and the basic keyboard functions will also work on a Mac too, just not all the shortcut keys.

Overall, I am giving this keyboard just under 5 stars. The price is very good and they keys actually impressed me with their feel. If you want a real mechanical keyboard, don't get this one. You can find a real mechanical keyboard for around this price, and if you don't need the number pad on the right, an 98 key mechanical is very affordable. But if you want an easy to press key that feels good and is relatively quiet, with lots of color, this is a great choice. It's obviously a budget keyboard, but I don't think much more expensive models by brand like Razer are much better, if at all. I was debating between 4 and 5 stars, but I'm going to give it 5 because it was a lot better than expected from a keyboard in this price range. Hopefully it will last a while, I haven't used a keyboard with these switches for long term so I guess we will see.

So instead of getting a nice big Micro SD card, you have to shell out 2x, 3x, even sometimes 4x the amount for the same capacity.  It's stupid, but since gamers keep buying their junk, they don't learn.

The next problem is that the Vita doesn't have enough RAM build-in to do jack.  My son asked for this thing like 2 years ago.  First it was that his PSN id wouldn't work because you have to buys PSN+ specifically for the Vita user (can't just use the ""family"" plan like you ought to), then after shelling out money for a second PSN+ we find out that none of the games will fit in the on-board memory!  It's ridiculous!

Crappy product design aside, the memory card did what it was supposed to.  Once installed, my son was FINALLY able to play the free games from PSN+ as well as the few games he bought digitally.

Found some challenge with that until I started a Witch Doctor. You can summon three dogs (that never die) and spam fire bat and walk through the whole game.

I highly recommend this game if you have absolutely no skill playing video games or you like taking a nap while you play (don't worry, when you wake up you will still be alive).

I experienced multiple gamebreaking bugs within the first 5 hours of singleplayer and haven't touched it since.

Multiplayer was ruined the second EA added p2w lootboxes. Thanks to a bloated manifest, maxing your manifest without paying real money takes about 600-700 hours. Lootbox RNG combined with a lot of hackers and some broken mechanics means this game is a no go.

53129,9314,3642,"I am a racing enthusiast and I was looking for a replacement for my g25 steering wheel that went belly up. I really liked the g25 and although mine died, 6+ years of heavy usage were decent enough that I considered sticking with Logitech. Im glad that I didnt. One day I saw that the Thrustmaster 300RS GT was on sale and I jumped on it. The 300RS GT is a Cadillac among beaters. 1080 degrees of motion, awesome peripherals (Yes, get the TH8A, you will not regret it.), the force feedback feels like the real deal and the movement of the wheel is extremely fluid. Some people complained about the pedals not being good enough about 5 months of heavy usage and they are awesome and just to make thing better my g25 looked like a toy, this one also looks and feel like the real deal.
Pros:
- Great range of motion
- Sturdy construction
- Bang for your buck
- Several enhancing peripherals available.
Cons:
- Not necessarily a con but the paddles rotate with the steering wheel, although some cars are like that, I prefer static paddles. Did not knock a star for it because it excels at everything and this is a preference more than a failure.

The feel is fantastic, and there's no ghosting when you overlap typing from one key to the other, let alone when you're gaming and need to press multiple keys at once. As a gaming keyboard, this is pretty cool, but I was surprised by how nicely it works as a productivity keyboard, too!

The backlighting is a bit on the extreme side, but you can control the type, direction, and speed of the lights. You can also just turn them off entirely, or turn them on and have them remain static like a standard backlit keyboard.

The cord is nice and long, so you don't have to worry if your computer isn't right up next to your monitor. The rubber feet on the bottom keep the keyboard solid in place on your desktop, too.

For the price, this is a five-star keyboard that is suitable for both gaming and productivity.

The saves are spaced just so far apart that when you get to one, your want to stop is outweighed by the want to go on and get to the next one. Of course you want to stop at the next boss battle but by then you've already come so far you beat the boss and get to the next save. The cycle continues.

53251,324,3152,"First off, I have used lots of different mice. I am a peripherals officianado. I purchased this mouse not for a high-end sensor, but as a cheap way to get a feel for this style of ergonomic mouse without going ""all in"" on a similarly-shaped $50 mouse.

I'm bothering with a ""proper"" review not because this is a mouse that is an elite piece of hardware for hardcore gaming, it's not. I'm writing this review because the mouse is an excellent overall physical (note I'm not saying aesthetic) design and a decent value overall.

If you are looking for this exact mouse shell with a competitive-grade 3360 gaming sensor, look up the Fenek Swift and thank me later :)

Ergonomics/Size: 9.5/10
This mouse curves perfectly with my hand, particularly the thumb area. I do find the rear-end is a little long for my liking, but barely so. Among the mice I own are the Logitech G403, G303, G203, G400s,G100s Roccat Kone Pure, TT Ventus R, Rival 310, Cougar 600M, MSI GM40, MSI DS100, Moto V40, Corsair Harpoon, Technet M009...This mouse is the most comfortable of them all. I use a fingertip grip while playing with a palm while browsing (medium hands). The G203 and Corsair feel pretty good while the G403 and Rival310 feel very good - but the Rival310 is actually pretty huge. The shape of this mouse has convinced my to purchase the CoolerMaster MM530, which has a virtually identical overall shape. Side grips are textured plastic and work well for me even when palms are sweaty or covered with mom's spaghetti.

Aesthetics: 4.0/10
They are what they are. The mouse doesn't look hideous, but it does look pretty cheap in my opinion. The colors clarity is fine, nothing to write home about.

Primary Buttons: 7.0 / 10
Primary clicks are not separated from the shell, the pictures are kinda deceiving. As a result, clicks are a little harder than they'd have been otherwise but both are clean and snappy with moderate resistance, similar to the Rival 310 but cleaner.

Thumb Buttons/Middle Click: 8.5/10
Both thumb buttons are out of the way but not hard to get to - positioning is perfect. Both thumb buttons have light actuation force required with good tactility and virtually no pre-travel. The rear thumb button has some post-travel, but not an issue. The buttons themselves are glossy plastic which I personally don't like, but this detracts very little. Overall, this is a <$10 mouse with some of the best thumb buttons I've tried - on par with the G403, slightly below the Rival 310. Middle click is moderate force and does not cause the scroll to move. No issues.

Scroll: 7.5 10
Light scroll resistance with fairly indistinct steps. Better for browsing than gaming but never messed me up in game.

Weight/Mousefeet: 9.0/10 (After weights removed, 4.5 before)
The mousefeet work just fine, which is to say I have zero issues with them. The mouse weighs in at just under 110g out of the box.  There are two 10 gram weights inside however. I took a hairdryer to the mouse feet and was able to carefully but easily remove the 2 rear mouse feet. There are clips at the front of the mouse, so there's no need to remove the front skate. With the weights removed, it is roughly the same weight as the wired G403 without its weight (90g) and it is able to fly around the mousepad.

Sensor: 5.5/10 ALMOST UNUSABLE FOR LOW DPI PLAYERS
Yep, this is where most of the bad news is. The mouse uses an Avago-5050 sensor. 8g, 30ips, that's it. Tracking is actually fairly decent, I can't tell it apart from a 3090 at low DPI and low tracking speeds. As an avid CS:GO player, I did have the sensor spin out about once a game on average. I continued to use this mouse for casual matches because of the excellent ergonomics. NOTE: Don't get any ideas for using this mouse competitively, I play at 800-1200 DPI on all my mice (usually 1100 with in game sense of 1.8). A palm-grip player at 400DPI would probably find this mouse unusable.

Software: NA
I couldn't get the software to work on my computer, so staying with N/A for now.

Verdict:
IF you are a relaxed palmer or a deep fingertip type with med-large hands, and IF you don't mind the looks and IF you have no aspirations of becoming a pro gamer, this mouse will do well for you.

IF you are a hardcore gamer and like what you've read, definitely look into the Fenek Swift (identical shell) and the CoolerMaster MM530.",first use lot differ mouse peripher officianado purchas mous highend sensor cheap way get feel style ergonom mous without go similarlyshap 50 mous im bother proper review mous elit piec hardwar hardcor game im write review mous excel overal physic note im say aesthet design decent valu overal look exact mous shell competitivegrad 3360 game sensor look fenek swift thank later ergonomics 9510 mous curv perfectli hand particularli thumb area find rearend littl long like bare among mouse logitech g403 g303 g203 g400sg100 roccat kone pure tt ventu r rival 310 cougar 600m msi gm40 msi ds100 moto v40 corsair harpoon technet m009thi mous comfort use fingertip grip play palm brow medium hand g203 corsair feel pretti good g403 rival310 feel good rival310 actual pretti huge shape mous convinc purchas coolermast mm530 virtual ident overal shape side grip textur plastic work well even palm sweati cover mom spaghetti aesthet 4010 mous doesnt look hideou look pretti cheap opinion color clariti fine noth write home primari button 70 10 primari click,1517184000,5

Concept: 9/10
Aliens sent an army of robots to wipe out the Earth.  The last of the humans are on a moon base and they send battle androids back down to Earth to destroy the robot army.  You play as these androids.  The gameplay is a mix of old-school top down 2D Shooters, 3D Shooters, Shooting Platformers, and 3D Full Melee Combat with an arsenal of weaponry and of course, more shooting.  You can travel freely through an open world to find quests, fight enemies, and explore.

Story: 10/10!!!
What is life?  Where does it begin and when does it end?

Gameplay Combat: 9/10
The meat of the game is 3D combat where you can lock onto an enemy and attack, dodge, shoot, use a special weapon.  There's bullet dodging, combos, bullet shooting, special attacks, and an arsenal of weapons.  All of your weaponry is upgradeable.  The combat runs at 60fps, so it's really smooth.  You'll be able to take on 1 to 20 enemies at a time, too.  It's more fun than difficult.

The 2D shooting is pretty easy.  Enemies appear onscreen and fire at you.  You can fire back and evade.  The enemy bullets are color coded.  Orange can be shot, purple cannot.  So you have to think quickly whether you want to shoot the incoming shots or dodge.  It's fun.

3D shooting puts you in the center of the screen and the enemies appear all around you.  You use an analog stick to rotate and fire in all directions.  You can fire back and evade.  The color coded shots apply here, too.  It's not too tough and these battles are short.

2D platforming is fun.  Run to the left or right, shoot, use combo attacks, and take out enemies.  It's fast paced and not too difficult.

There are a few bosses in the game and they'll unleash a hailstorm of shots at you.  You've got to dodge and fire back.  These fights are also fun.  I only died once in combat throughout the entire game.  I thought it was easy, but I was still fully engaged when fighting enemies.

Gameplay Exploration: 6/10
The only bad thing I can say about this game is that the Map and Map Design are confusing.  The game takes place in a ruined city on Earth.  Giant skyscrapers and giant trees are all that remain.  In order to keep the game running at 60fps, the team had to reduce the draw distance.  This isn't like Assassin's Creed where you can see detailed buildings for miles around.  Instead, the map is very blocky and acts like a maze.  A quest may appear on your map and it tells you to head west, but you really need to go south, run up a giant tree branch, then head west, then north up another tree to the top of a building, then east to find a cave, then west...  It can get very frustrating just trying to find side quests.  The auto-map feature could have been implemented much better.

Gameplay Quests: 10/10
When you get optional or main quests, they are fun.  The characters are interesting and you're rewarded for your efforts.

Gameplay Upgrades: 10/10
The battle androids can be upgraded with chips that you find in the world.  You can buy them, find them, or kill to get them.  These chips can be combined to create a more powerful chip with the same ability.  For example:  If you have two Weapon +2 chips, you can combine them to create a Weapon +3 chip, which gives you an attack bonus on your weapons.  Two Weapon +3 chips will become a Weapon +4 chip.

These chips take up space on a circuit board.  The more powerful chips take up more space.  It's up to you to pick which chips you want to use.  The circuit board is also upgradeable later on in the game, allowing you to use more chips.  The chips can be swapped in and out at any time.

The types of chips available increase melee damage, ranged damage, damage when you are close to death, increase your stamina, your speed, give you, heal just before death, automatically regenerate health if you take 0 damage for x seconds, increase your melee defense, your ranged defense, your hacking skills...  It's completely up to you to Mix and Match the chips to enhance your character.

The chips are color coded when you install them.  So you can see how much space each one takes and the color tells you if it is offensive, defensive, system, or support.  It would have been easier if the names of the chips were on the chips themselves, like Ranged Defense + 2.  But they are only color coded.  This is a very minor complaint.

There is an arsenal of upgradeable weapons at your disposal.  You also have a combat pod as your companion.  This can shoot enemies and their shots, or fire a special weapon like a laser cannon or gravity bomb.  The pods are also upgradeable.  At times, you will also have another android and their pod as your companion as well.

Graphics: 8/10
The characters look great and they are stylized.  The animations are smooth; the environments, not so much.  Most of the processing power went into the characters and the fast combat.

Sound: 10/10
NieR has a great Soundtrack reminiscent of the legendary Panzer Dragoon Saga or Ghost in the Shell.  The voice acting is very well done and the combat effects punctuate the action.

Replay Value: ??? This is a unique situation
Finish the game and Continue...
You can play through the adventure again as 9S, the hacker who assists 2B the first time through.  9S is a hacker, not a fighter, so the gameplay is slightly different.  He can still run, dash, jump, and shoot, but it's easier to hack into enemies and beat them via mini-game with 9S.  When you beat the game with 9S you can continue again...
This unlocks the final act of the game.  There are 26 different endings, 5 of these are main endings for the game.
When you get a special ending, it unlocks debug tools and you can play through any part of the game or the story to experience it all.

Maturity: Teen
You can see 2B's sexy underwear and there's a lot of combat.  You just kill robots, but they act more human than the humans in most video games, so there's some emotional content as well.  Theres no blood, but there may be tears.

Overall: 9/10

The headset arrived first and my first reaction was what did I pay $150 for here? the sound is just as good if not a little worse than my logitechs I had because the headset has very low volume for some reason without the mixamp. Once I got the mixamp in the mail there was a night and day difference, the two combined is 300% better than just the headset alone.

53371,256,4478,"Instead of Dungeons and Dragons like in the first game; the South Park kids has their eyes dead set on Superheroes theme.

Like the TV show there's profanity and dark, surreal, and discriminatory humor. Instead of a wide variety of jokes (some hit-and-miss IMO) present in the South Park:The Stick of Truth; this game has a heavy focuses on fart jokes and cultural identity/race; so if you get easily offended by this then this may not be the game for you. Even the difficulty select screen has a dark racial social commentary to it.

You still play a silent protagonists, even though it directly picks off from the first game (won't spoil the ending). What's starts off as finding a missing cat, and which group of kids will dominate in making the best super hero franchise turns into something bigger that effects the whole town. Plus there's some plot twist of sorts along the way. The title is obviously a play on words if you haven't noticed, and will not click until the final act of the game

Graphics for the most part is the same from the first game, with exception of maybe more detail in the costumes and overall texture. Game does run at a solid 60fps now.

Gameplay:
You start off with 3 classes with a wide variety of super powers to choose from. This will eventually expand to more classes and abilities where you can mix-and-match

Combat is a grid based system this time around (instead of 2-sided turn based system) having some attacks, buffs and debuffs (status effects) covering a certain area of the grid. Positioning is key as some moves may have knock back features attach to them or AOE damage

There's an upgrade tree that expands once you level up. Instead of selecting individual attributes via what you wear*, you have to equip items you find or buy (in game currency) as you progress through the game.

Wearables are purely cosmetic and does not influence your stats in-game

There's also a crafting system where you combine undesirable items to better ones to use as in-game health/revives or artifacts to attach to your upgrade tree

The software for it is also, for the most part, straight forward and works fantastic. Being able to make presets with it and switch between games easily is a dream as well. There are a few things I wish it could do that it doesn't seem to be able to do button wise; however, that could just be me and also it is personal preference so I won't take anything away from it.

53396,1609,1801,"This is the most amazing headset I have ever used, but only by a small margin.  I have a very big head and ears, and the ear pads are perfect.  It is like lowering the cone of silence onto your head.  VERY comfortable.  I use the noise canceling mic and the audio adapter and it is everything you hoped it would be.  It comes with three cables, but strangely no right angle connector where it plugs into the controller - just a straight connector.  The XO7s came with better cables IMO.  The cables are rubber coated instead of cloth like the XO7.  All in all, the sound is very comparable, with a nod to the elite.  The ear cups are not comparable since the elite is lightyears better, and the part that goes across your head is pretty sweet on the elite.  The X07 creek and groan as you talk after a while due to the plastic, and so far the Elite is as quiet as a graveyard.  The cost is the only reason that I did not peg the star meter.

You would think that something this awesome would have the ability to do 7.1 audio, but alas this is not an option for whatever reason.

53422,9268,1517,"To cover each of those points:

""The Dungeon Movement sucks."" The camera is controlled by the L and R buttons, as well as the Dpad. Attacking an enemy while moving around has a delay that feels too long. There's three camera angles of close, far away, and awkwardly-over-the-shoulder. The enemies also appear in the over-world as a weird mass of blue blocks that clashes with just about every setting in the game.

""Combat is decent."" That's a lie, this is SMT where the combat is eternally broken in your favor. Once you get demons the game becomes exponentially easier. Spoiler: that's the first five minutes of the game. Standard SMT systems for the most part, standard seven elements if you count physical, plus talking to the enemy, as is standard. Party size is lower than I'm used to for the 3DS SMT games, with only a party size of 4 active combatants at a time, as opposed to the 6 we had in Soul Hackers, or the ridiculous 12 party members at a time in the Devil Survivor games, but that actually is a good thing as it makes things feel a bit more focused, and gives a little less room to cover everything with one party, leading to strategy gaining some more importance.

""Story is standard SMT for the most part"" Multiple ending paths that involve aligning with angels, demons, or just not. Setting is interesting and seems to be related to other games, but like always nothing is concrete.

""MC's hair reminds me of Mara."" That wasn't a joke. Just look at it. It looks like Mara rolled around in brown paint and was slapped down on the MC's head. Poor guy, must have been traumatic.

53436,4941,2851,"Scooby Doo First Frights is a beat 'em up game that either pays homage to, or flat out steals from, the Lego games.  The formula is pretty much the same with only minor differences.  However, if you like this kind of game play, you'll probably get your couple bucks worth.

The story is that The Mystery Inc Gang are taking a vacation, and are heading to Keystone Castle for an Eating Contest, but first they have to solve other mysteries.  These take place in a High School Musical, A creepy Carnival, a spooky coastal town, before finally going to the castle.  Classic Scooby Doo fare, so fans are sure to enjoy.

As mentioned, the gameplay borrows heavily from the Lego Games.  You fight enemies, break objects to gather scooby snacks (the currency, we'll talk about what you can buy with it later) and respawn in the same spot after death.  Like the Lego Games, it lacks challenge, but what it does not lack is charm.  There are multiple levels in each episode.  Each episode includes a chase with Shaggy and Scooby, and a boss battle, after which the crook is unmasked.  The levels give hints about who it is and try to make you think.  The third level is really the only one that does, in the others it's very obvious.  Correctly guessing the crook rewards you their mask.  After each episode, the costumes you find in the levels are available for purchase.  Before you buy them, the costumes are locked to the level they were worn in.  These costumes change their attacks and non-story based dialogue, but the abilities remain the same.

Speaking of abilities, each character has their own.  Fred is the strongman who can push and pull heavy objects or turn cranks, Daphne is agile and can climb poles, Velma is smart and can operate terminals, Shaggy has a yo-yo and can grapple, and scooby is....a dog so he can use the dog doors.  Playing the level the first time, you're locked as the characters picked for you, but you can replay the levels in explore mode, and can swap out characters on the fly (save for the very first level, and any chase or boss battle) The first level is the tutorial.  It has you play as all the characters so you can see what they can do and who you like best.  It does a good job teaching you what you need to know for the journey ahead.  The game even lets you play as the enemies...once you buy them that is.  There's also five hidden costumes that are only unlockable with cheats.  Let me save you the trouble real quick.

2839 Daphne Karate Black Belt costume
4826 Fred Knight costume
1585 Scooby-Doo Egyptian costume
3726 Shaggy Native American costume
6588 Velma Pirate outfit

The only real problems I have with the game are how long it takes to spawn a character in explore mode, and how clumsy two player mode is.  Yes, this game has co op.  But there's no split screen like the newer Lego games, so you have to stay together.  Yet when playing alone, if a character gets left behind, they teleport next to you.  That aside I really enjoy the game.

For presentation, the game NAILS that Scooby Doo vibe.  Everyone looks and sounds like they should, and they even included a laugh track. The bosses all say ""And I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!"" All the classic scooby doo troupes are present and accounted for, it nearly feels like an unaired prototype Scooby Doo show in and of itself.

So that's Scooby Doo First Frights.  Is it worth your time? Well if you're looking for a challenging game, or don't like the Lego games, this won't be for you, but if you do enjoy this kind of game, or are a die hard Scooby Doo fan, you'll probably have fun with it, as it can be a nice distraction if you're bored.  Don't spend a lot for it, but do pick it up if you find it for a reasonable price.",scoobi doo first fright beat em game either pay homag flat steal lego game formula pretti much minor differ howev like kind game play youll probabl get coupl buck worth stori mysteri inc gang take vacat head keyston castl eat contest first solv mysteri take place high school music creepi carniv spooki coastal town final go castl classic scoobi doo fare fan sure enjoy mention gameplay borrow heavili lego game fight enemi break object gather scoobi snack currenc well talk buy later respawn spot death like lego game lack challeng lack charm multipl level episod episod includ chase shaggi scoobi bos battl crook unmask level give hint tri make think third level realli one other obviou correctli guess crook reward mask episod costum find level avail purchas buy costum lock level worn costum chang attack nonstori base dialogu abil remain speak abil charact fred strongman push pull heavi object turn crank daphn agil,1517616000,5
