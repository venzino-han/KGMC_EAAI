53441,6714,3803,"I bought this remote because I habitually use my Xbox One to watch shows and movies on Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. I saw the price of the official Microsoft Media Remote and said ""nope"". Seriously... $50 for a remote?! Being the reasonable person I am (and that you are since you are looking here), I went with this remote.

I am well pleased with the Talon Media Remote. There was absolutely no setup involved aside from placing the batteries inside it. I have read some reviews complaining that they had troubles with the remote's infrared getting to the console. Personally, this remote is working better than my Vizio TV remote. It may also help that my Xbox is on an open shelf of the TV stand with no interference such as cabinet doors.

The remote itself feels well-made. The material feels soft but has more than adequate grip. The entire backing comes off in order to add or replace batteries, which can be annoying to some, but it really makes the remote look nicer and it feels nicer to hold.

The remote also has a nifty backlighting so you can see in the darkest of times. Others have complained that the backlighting needs to sustain itself for just a little bit longer so they can find their desired button. I had experienced no trouble with that until I really needed the backlighting, and I couldn't agree more- hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

The Xbox ""Home"" button on the remote can turn on your Xbox which has completely eliminated my need for a controller when I just want to watch a movie or show. And the remote doesn't have to constantly be turned on and connected again when you haven't touched it for so long, unlike the Xbox controllers. That has been most handy for me.

If you want to use a simple, cheaper but well made remote to watch your shows and movies instead of your controller, this is an excellent option!

Hope I could help you with your decision.

If you have a newer tv like we do (Samsung 4k) with NO RCA jacks, you MUST use the Sony A/V cable that came with your ps3, it plugs in the back of the box and has 3 rca jacks coming out of it. Plug the headphones into the USB jack in the front, then plug the rca jacks into the rca jacks that cone from your Sony A/V cable. The rca plugs on these headphones have a female end on the bottom of the male plugs so you can plug male rca jacks into the bottom of them. Then you have to go to the settings on the PS3 and change the sound settings from HDMI to the A/V setting and they will work. It's a little confusing but it works great after that. I was frustrated for awhile until I figured it out, Thank you Google and Toms guide.com!

I need to update this to 3 star. I would do one star but I happen to like product but -

I am a collector and a player for some of these items. However I did notice a change in production. These are not the original black labels. I am sure there is more then one production(s). I can not tell you it is authentic. But there is a production in line of these titles that are missing the card slot the older games provide. Who ever did this. I am sure they have or had a license But that license isn't covering for the fact the production line is selling black labels and not authentic production line. To a collector I am offended as a player of games I do not care. As I said who ever ordered the production most likely has a license to do so or granted. But this is misleading selling black labels.

53499,4935,4205,"Okay, this thing is awesome, I love the 5 programmable thumb buttons and you can reprogram every button on the mouse, down to the left and right scroll clicks. It comes with a program to where you can assign macros and key clicks to each individual button, which is super handy.

It comes with an indicator on the side to show which DPI setting that you're on, which is very handy, especially if you have reassigned those DPI buttons on the top of the mouse.

You can also save profiles for your button assignments, so that you can have separate mapping for different games if you'd like.

The light on the top of the mouse is programmable to be different colors, which is cool and for me, I like to turn that light off, which is possible.

The GUI for the programming interface is a little slow and clicks don't always register, but once you do the initial setup you don't need to use it much anymore besides to switch profiles.

The weight of the mouse is a little heavy for me, but luckily it has adjustable weights in it and I removed the weights and it made it much better for where I wanted the weight.",okay thing awesom love 5 programm thumb button reprogram everi button mous left right scroll click come program assign macro key click individu button super handi come indic side show dpi set your handi especi reassign dpi button top mous also save profil button assign separ map differ game youd like light top mous programm differ color cool like turn light possibl gui program interfac littl slow click dont alway regist initi setup dont need use much anymor besid switch profil weight mous littl heavi luckili adjust weight remov weight made much better want weight,1517788800,5

53501,5923,213,"I had one of these before and lost it in a move. These wireless adapters work great, and I hope they're always available to me. I'll be using Xbox 360 controllers for local multiplayer games for a long time. I use this wireless adapter to allow me to use up to 4 Xbox 360 controllers at once. Most games with controller support will support these controllers out-of-the-box, too. The connection is stable for up to about 30 feet from my experience, but you could probably use it farther away than that with some slight lag, and there's no reason to use these wireless adapters more than 10-15 feet away, anyway, unless you're playing in a theater room!

The presentation of this adapter is pretty bland. It doesn't show a big LED circle of controller connections like the console does. Instead, you get that information from an on-screen driver software overlay. The overlay is somewhat annoying if you use Steam, because Steam does its own thing when you press the controller's Xbox/home button. That said, you can pretty much disable the overlay without too much fuss, and it's easy to tell when you're connected as a specific player based on the controller's LED ring. The lack of presentation quality on the adapter itself is sort of a blessing in disguise, because it blends in with black cases and can be quite unnoticeable and inconspicuous.

The only potentially deal-breaking downside to this adapter is the cord. Xbox One adapters don't have a cord, they are just typical wifi dongle shaped boxes. The Xbox 360 adapter, on the other hand, can more easily fit into the back of your computer, so I would consider that a positive aspect of having a cord.",one lost move wireless adapt work great hope theyr alway avail ill use xbox 360 control local multiplay game long time use wireless adapt allow use 4 xbox 360 control game control support support control outofthebox connect stabl 30 foot experi could probabl use farther away slight lag there reason use wireless adapt 1015 foot away anyway unless your play theater room present adapt pretti bland doesnt show big led circl control connect like consol instead get inform onscreen driver softwar overlay overlay somewhat annoy use steam steam thing press control xboxhom button said pretti much disabl overlay without much fuss easi tell your connect specif player base control led ring lack present qualiti adapt sort bless disguis blend black case quit unnotic inconspicu potenti dealbreak downsid adapt cord xbox one adapt dont cord typic wifi dongl shape box xbox 360 adapt hand easili fit back comput would consid posit aspect cord,1517788800,5

53581,7281,3245,"Huh.  Well, I'm posting this on February 7th, 2018 and the game came out nearly ten years ago.  And it's STILL worth $60?  I don't think so.  Buy from a reputable seller here on Amazon, not new.  'Cause holy damn!  I mean, the game is good, don't get me wrong.  However, the first Fable was released way back in 2005, if I remember correctly, so we had been waiting a while for another and the sequel game looked stunning and worth the wait.  And, for the most part, it was.  I just don't see anyone paying $60 for a game that came out ten years ago if it's not some special collector's edition, which this isn't.  That's just lunacy.

Anywho, on to the actual review of the game.  Fable II is a continuation of sorts from the original Fable.  It's set in the same world, Albion, with some of the same characters hinted at, but hundreds of years later.  Oakvale, our favorite small-town home from the first game, is a shadow of what it once was and heroes have fallen into the stuff of legends.  In fact, the main city of Bowerstone is the new hub of action.  A madman named Lucien is your antagonist, ready to purge the world of its inhabitants due to the fact that he can't handle the chaos that comes with living.  Instead of offing himself like a weaker human, he attempts to destroy the whole world with magic using a foreboding magical structure called The Spire.  Ooh.  Aah.

Typical of the Fable games is the issue of choice.  The first Fable was one of the first games that kept a running record of your actions and how it affected how people viewed you.  The same stands true for its sequel.  Every action has a reaction in the world and how people view you.  Some new doodads include a faithful dog, who is often my favorite part of the game, the ability to choose your gender (restricted only to Ms and Fs, but with the ability to cross-dress in the game), and more varied quests.

I am quite blown away, even still, by the graphics of the game, so that's a plus.  The music is lulling, soft, and lovely.  Combat is very similar to the first, but features charged spells for more ouchies.  Another thing I kind of appreciate is that the game developers did away with Physical Shield from the first game.  It, literally, made you invincible and, therefore, the game became incessantly easy if you just put all your upgrades to Physical Shield.  There's less Will/Spell options in Fable II, but they are effective all the same.  The monsters/human enemies are of a decent range, but nothing to write home about. Your dog, also, is of help, attacking after enemies who are knocked down, helping you to find treasure, and being an all around goofball while you use your expressions and ""converse"" with the people of Albion.

Like most Lionhead games, the comical relief is rampant and hysterical.  The game is definitely for mature audiences for its lewd humor.  Whether it comes from listening in on drunken rambles, reading a book, watching a drunk give over his dinner to the sidewalk, or being hit on by a homosexual, the game is obviously rather liberal with its humor and makes light of the story line.  People will insult or love your appearance, run away screaming or come to gaze upon the sexiest wo/man alive.  It's just plain fun.  Your expressions are more varied and your dog chimes in once you teach him tricks and some of them are downright funny.

So what's so bad about this game?  Why give it four stars?!!! THE MASSES MUST KNOW!!

Well, I played through it twice, with the intention of playing it three times as there are three, count 'em, three options at the end of the game to choose from.  I just couldn't do it.  It got boring, fast.  Some of the BEST equipment you can only get after the completion of the game and it's, honestly, useless at that point.  All that's left is time after defeating Lucien to get some achievement points.  If that's your thing, then great, but I'm not one to put in an extra 8 hours into a game for 15 points to an achievement score that does nothing but portray how much or how little games dictate your life.  Just not my thing.  Again, it also bothers me that some of the best equipment is after the end of the game when the biggest, hardest boss is already defeated.  Why do that?  Why bother?  And so, I stole a star away from that five star option.

However, the game IS fun and IS a blast to play through and you WILL love your dog and enjoy the lewd humor if you like that sort of thing.  It's just not worth $60 ten years after its release.",huh well im post februari 7th 2018 game came nearli ten year ago still worth 60 dont think buy reput seller amazon new caus holi damn mean game good dont get wrong howev first fabl releas way back 2005 rememb correctli wait anoth sequel game look stun worth wait part dont see anyon pay 60 game came ten year ago special collector edit isnt that lunaci anywho actual review game fabl ii continu sort origin fabl set world albion charact hint hundr year later oakval favorit smalltown home first game shadow hero fallen stuff legend fact main citi bowerston new hub action madman name lucien antagonist readi purg world inhabit due fact cant handl chao come live instead of like weaker human attempt destroy whole world magic use forebod magic structur call spire ooh aah typic fabl game issu choic first fabl one first game kept run record action affect peopl view stand true sequel everi action,1517961600,4

3rd round (C route): 2 Star: Very frustrated.

DLC: 5 Star: Be aware DLC feature is only available later stage (A route or later)

Recommendation: Research some site to know.
1) Network feature seems not necessary. But without it, it seems very difficult to clear even easy mode.
2) It will erase save data by certain selection at ending. (better to back up USB or PS Plus)
3) There're some places can do auto-leveling and auto-earning.

53587,310,117,"Legend of Legacy features key development staff from Square Enix's ""SaGa"" series, including composer Masashi Hamauzu (SaGa Frontier II, UNLIMITED:SaGa) and illustrator Tomomi Kobayashi (entire SaGa series). The game was developed by a relatively new studio, FuRyu (previous work includes Unchained Blades), and published by Atlus. Much like a traditional SaGa game, you can choose from one of seven characters for your first adventure. Each character has a chief motive driving them into the game's overarching narrative. For some characters, their motive plays into each and every change, each and every dungeon. For other characters, their motivations merely provide humor and flavor text as you go.

No matter what you do, one thing you will notice is that this turn-based RPG (per SaGa standards) is *hard.* But, you cannot grind your way out of it. In SaGa games, including LoL, you will need to grind smart, not hard. It is important to balance which offensive, defensive, and support stances you learn, as well as what skills you develop. Will each of your three party members learn one of the three elemental charm spells, or will you have one character who learns all three elemental charm spells while another character focuses on physical attacks, and a third on defense? You have a lot of options, and those options will determine which mandatory (and optional) bosses you can easily topple, and which ones will become monumental struggles.

From an aesthetic experience alone, Legend of Legacy is great. Its mechanics are rough around the edges, but still solid.

53627,4685,2112,"I'm very happy with my T300, though I wish the housing wasn't quite so large. Taking off the top cover it looks like a lot of space could have been saved with a little effort on Thrustmaster's part, making the odd housing much easier to accomodate for in a dashboard build such as my own. Instead, I needed to carve my dashboard in order to fit the T300. I suppose I can't complain much on this part, but if there's onething I'd change; this is it.

The ability to swap wheels is very nice, but as I change between a circle and F1 wheel often I wish the connecting collar was metal instead of plastic. As you must insert a screw into the collar in order to secure a wheel to it, my collar's screwhole has become just a little loose; causing concern. Functionally it still works and I haven't felt that one of my wheels is going to fall off or wiggle around yet, I'm concerned for the future.

The software suite that Thrustmaster uses is one of my favorites, and I've not had a detection issue with any game I've tried as of yet. The wheel, all of its buttons and switches, the pedal inputs and the shifter are all on the same page of the suite. Comparitively, Fanatec devices require a different configuration page for each connected device which is frustrating at times. I didn't like the T3PA Pro pedals at all and opted to use Fanatec CSV3 Pedals instead. The Thrustmaster's software suite still picks up on the Fantec's inputs and shows them on the configuration page with the T300; which is very, very nice. I also use a Fanatec CSS1.5 Shifter, which also works on the Thrustmaster configuration page. Neither fanatec devices can be connected to the wheel, which isn't a complaint, but an observation; which is why I was surprsised to see them show up in Thrustmaster's software.

I've tried a Fanatec Clubsport base + wheel configuration and found the force feedback to be a bit stronger, but strangely not as smooth or precise. I'm very happy I decided to go with the Thrustmaster instead, and the ease of using other hardware with it makes me very happy. The T300 is also significantly cheaper than a Fantec wheel setup, although not quite as customizable. I'm alright with this, as I feel the majority of users won't want to change their wheels out often (or even own more than one).

All in all, I'm very happy.",im happi t300 though wish hous wasnt quit larg take top cover look like lot space could save littl effort thrustmast part make odd hous much easier accomod dashboard build instead need carv dashboard order fit t300 suppos cant complain much part there oneth id chang abil swap wheel nice chang circl f1 wheel often wish connect collar metal instead plastic must insert screw collar order secur wheel collar screwhol becom littl loo caus concern function still work havent felt one wheel go fall wiggl around yet im concern futur softwar suit thrustmast use one favorit ive detect issu game ive tri yet wheel button switch pedal input shifter page suit comparit fanatec devic requir differ configur page connect devic frustrat time didnt like t3pa pro pedal opt use fanatec csv3 pedal instead thrustmast softwar suit still pick fantec input show configur page t300 nice also use fanatec css15 shifter also work thrustmast configur page neither fanatec devic connect,1518048000,5

53717,1467,181,"I rolled my eyes at the concept of gaming peripherals, especially the Razer brand, for a long time. Never really felt like they offered anything that justified the increased price that slapping ""gaming"" or ""esports"" onto the box typically comes with. However, this mouse actually costs loss than more contemporary mice you might see at an office store without the ""gaming"" label, and has many features that will actually be beneficial to a gamer.

First thing I want to talk about is polling rate. A USB mouse will by default poll at 125hz. This means, 125 times per second, your computer is receiving movement input from your mouse about its current location, which is then used to move your cursor around on the desktop or in a game. Simple. For a 60hz display, this means that it has just over 2 inputs to look at before it has to decide where your cursor belongs on screen, and this feels nice. But for someone that has a higher refresh rate display, a traditional mouse at the default polling rate may be insufficient. I have a 144hz display that I use primarily for FPS gaming. With a standard mouse at a 125hz polling rate, this means that for 19 frames per second, an input is either duplicated, ignored, or something is interpolated (made up entirely) to decide where my cursor should go. This leads to jitter and overshoot problems depending upon how the software or your drivers decide to handle this. On the windows desktop with a suitably fast display, you can actually see the cursor jitter if you focus on its movement. No good for gamers.

This mouse offers 500hz and 1000hz polling rates in order to rectify this. While it's probably a completely unnecessary feature for someone that's still playing on a 60hz or 75hz display, this is an absolute necessity for someone with a 100hz+ monitor. Moving the cursor around finally feels as smooth as it should both in-game and for standard use in the desktop environment.

The physical design is nice. There are rubber grips on the left and right side, exactly where they should be for someone that uses a finger grip to hold and move the mouse around. They acknowledge that the mouse is not large enough to be palmed by an adult and have designed it accordingly. The silly RGB LEDs can be turned off. The materials used on the bottom of the mouse drag less than most mice, and its light size makes it easier and smoother to move around. I no longer feel like i'm fighting against my mousepad to move the mouse around.

I would definitely recommend this mouse for anyone with a high refresh rate display. While this does appear to be one of razer's 'budget' mice, they did not skimp on any of the sensors, buttons, or physical design itself. The software could use some tweaking, I'd have liked to see more options for rebinding mouse inputs, but that's not anything that can't be corrected with other free software.",roll eye concept game peripher especi razer brand long time never realli felt like offer anyth justifi increas price slap game esport onto box typic come howev mous actual cost loss contemporari mouse might see offic store without game label mani featur actual benefici gamer first thing want talk poll rate usb mous default poll 125hz mean 125 time per second comput receiv movement input mous current locat use move cursor around desktop game simpl 60hz display mean 2 input look decid cursor belong screen feel nice someon higher refresh rate display tradit mous default poll rate may insuffici 144hz display use primarili fp game standard mous 125hz poll rate mean 19 frame per second input either duplic ignor someth interpol made entir decid cursor go lead jitter overshoot problem depend upon softwar driver decid handl window desktop suitabl fast display actual see cursor jitter focu movement good gamer mous offer 500hz 1000hz poll rate order rectifi probabl complet unnecessari featur someon that still play,1518134400,5

53722,1467,3948,"The D-pad is very stiff. As someone that's been primarily using a Wii-U Pro controller for games on my PC, this took some adjustment.

For use on the PC, this controller is pretty versatile. 'PC' mode uses xinput, which makes it compatible with titles such as Street Fighter V without the use of external programs. 'PS3' and 'PS4' engage two different dinput modes - notably, the PS3 mode lets you use the PS button as a normal button in games.

I've got some preliminary concerns about the longevity of the controller - each button individually feels fine, but some combinations of them (such as square / triangle) feel stiff in a way that implies something is catching internally, causing more wear and tear than normal. Other reviews mentioning complaints about only getting a couple months or even weeks of life out of this. But the reality of life is that no one else is really producing a fighting pad with a dpad and layout quite like this, so that's a risk you're going to have to take when buying this. Personally, it still works for me after a couple of weeks and feels pretty good to use.

Here's an update, after a year of owning the product. I didn't play much Street Fighter V after purchasing this product - just wasn't what I was looking for. However, after only a couple of months of using this controller for Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite, the durability concerns were well founded - the buttons are getting harder to use over time, they're stopping just short of staying stuck pressed down. It bears resemblance to the way a controller feels if you've ever spilled something like juice or soda into it. The d-pad did loosen up with some use, and has stayed accurate this whole time - but the durability of the buttons give this controller a very 'disposable' feeling, and the price, sadly, does not match the quality. This would be fine for casual use, but if you want something that is actually going to hold up for use in a fighting game, look elsewhere.

53723,6130,99,"It's pretty good, but it's not great.

The Negative:
-It's a story-driven game, but the story is mediocre and contrived. The story also only goes up to level 50, so if you play beyond that to fight the high-level enemies you see roaming around since the start of the game, you'll run out of interesting things to do.
-The game has no particularly memorable characters
-There are only a couple good songs in the OST
-The game has a frustratingly slow, cumbersome camera. It's a few steps back in evolution. Even on the N64, this kind of camera control would've been criticized. It's only really functional in wide open spaces and only if you don't make sharp turns. A significant part of the gameplay is waiting for the camera to turn around. Even resetting the camera takes several seconds.
-When it comes to customizing your character's physical appearance, the game is mediocre and has limited options. It's hard not to make an ugly character and the pseudo-anime faces feel out of place when everything else has realistic aesthetics

The Positive:
-The world-building is excellent, not only in terms of the land but the beings that inhabit it and their relation to one another
-The game has a very good combat and skill system that keeps things fresh and interesting
-Quests, especially sidequests, often address controversial issues and moral ambiguity in a successful way
-The game succeeds in making the player care about what happens and want to see what happens next
-The game succeeds in creating a sense of urgency
-The game is very well-paced, introducing game-changing aspects of gameplay such as mech suits, flight, new skills and gear, new shops and party members and more to reward progress
-The mech suits, a major part of the game, are very-well implemented both in terms of gameplay and the mythical role they have in-universe
-Customization for mech suits and an abundance of clothing items somewhat makes up for the mediocre character creation
-Unlike most open-world games, there are enough satisfying diversions on your way to an objective that it's better not to fast travel",pretti good great neg storydriven game stori mediocr contriv stori also goe level 50 play beyond fight highlevel enemi see roam around sinc start game youll run interest thing game particularli memor charact coupl good song ost game frustratingli slow cumbersom camera step back evolut even n64 kind camera control wouldv critic realli function wide open space dont make sharp turn signific part gameplay wait camera turn around even reset camera take sever second come custom charact physic appear game mediocr limit option hard make ugli charact pseudoanim face feel place everyth el realist aesthet posit worldbuild excel term land be inhabit relat one anoth game good combat skill system keep thing fresh interest quest especi sidequest often address controversi issu moral ambigu success way game succe make player care happen want see happen next game succe creat sen urgenc game wellpac introduc gamechang aspect gameplay mech suit flight new skill gear new shop parti member reward progress mech suit major part game verywel,1518220800,4

I almost quit playing this in the first few hours due to the strange setup of time passage. I would pause it and leave it paused for hours and then come back because the Story and style had sucked me in, but the game play was meeting extreme resistance. Time is not set up as hours, but slots, during school you will usually see clips of your day. Your playable time consists of mostly 2 time slots of afterschool and evening. If you socialize with someone it will take up a timeslot. In the begining going to a palace will have to be done after school and when you return you will be too tired to do any other activity that day.(Two of your male friends have a request involving a maid, take it as soon as possible and do everything you can to level up the maid as quickly as possible, she will help some with your time crunch) I gave this game 5 stars because it is a very great RPG and you just must accept that the passage of time is how this is structured and embrace it. Find ways to make the most of your time. Try to prepare enough that you can go all the way through a palace to its stopping point in one day, Stack quest for mementos as much as it will workout progression-wise, level up your confidants and social stats in the most productive ways possible.

You will hate the cat early in this game as it will often tell you that you need to sleep and will not take no for an answer.

But overall, more people do prefer to play the game as a portable console, rather than a home console video game system like the Xbox One. But there are some whom still prefer to play video games like Super Mario Galaxy on the Switch as a home console. Nevertheless, there are so many different accessories that are made for the Switch, and controllers that do work, and others that are mixed at the end of the day. HORI in the past has had a few controllers that worked well for Nintendo in the past with the Wii and Nintendo 3DS. But with the Switch, they do have some accessories that have not shown the stamina in the way the Nintendo Switch should be played. This wired controller isn't as strong as the joy-con controllers for the Switch. Also, the 2 ZL & ZR buttons being on the front of the controller, rather than on the top-left & top-right, feels a bit more loose for gamers.  Still, it is a fair price for those who want a second controller for the Nintendo Switch. BUt at the end, it is not the strongest controller for the system.

53760,2280,3762,"This review is for the PS4 Version.

I have not played the previous games in the series but decided to grab this game and give it a try after the price dropped to around 20 bucks.  In some respects, this game reminds me of the GTA series with a mix of a bit of Far Cry.  I am not sure the gameplay is as smooth as the GTA5 or Far Cry, but it is pretty similar in a lot of ways.

For me, I have had a hard time getting use to the button setup as I have been playing the A/C series lately and gotten use to how to run, jump, etcwith those games.  The graphics are well done in this game as is the unique way the backstory is told.  The cut screens tend to be a bit long though and sometimes interrupt the flow of the game.

Initial install and load times tend to be long as well.  I thought I was done with the install after loading the disk only to find that there is more installing to do that takes several minutes after the title screen loads up.  Not a huge deal, but a bit annoying if you are ready to get playing.

Set in the 60s, this has a perfect soundtrack for the time the game is set in and really adds to the atmosphere. The missions are fun but do get repetitive over time.  The map doesnt seem to be packed with side missions or my least favorite thing to do in games, collectables.  The game could be a bit clearer on how it marks the objectives as well.  The game feels less open world and more linear than the GTA series.  The AI doesnt seem as smart as the GTA series.  The driving doesnt seem to be as smooth as GTA either.  No fast travel is a bit of a bummer with games these days as well.

Overall, I feel it is a solid game and worth playing for the 20 to 30 bucks price range but I don't think it matches GTA5 in overall gameplay, vast amount of missions and side quests.  I still find it enjoyable and engaging to play, even if it falls a bit short to what I have come to expect from games such as GTA and FC.

53778,288,3413,"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is the latest came to come out of the legendary Deus Ex franchise. Mankind Divided is a direct sequel to Human Revolution with the return of everyones favorite cyberpunk Batman Adam Jensen. In his quest to stop terrorism in a new aug apartheid world. Mankind Divided was a controversial game with bad PR around it. It started with augment your pre-order fisco, its political controversies with the aug lives matter, and the biggest one with its use of single player one playthrough Microtransactions. Where you essential buy cheat codes. All these factor lead to lack lusters sales and a hiatus of the franchise as Square Enix puts the team to work on Marvel games. So with future put on indefinite hold Mankind Divided will be the last Deus Ex game for a while. Is it any good? Did Deus Ex Mankind deserve the fate it got? Lets find out out.

Pros
-Lets start with the obvious the graphics are leagues better than Human Revolution with the ugly yellow color pallet gone that was the butt of many piss jokes. Characters and environments are rendered photorealistic. I played it on a PS4 Pro with a 4K TV and many times throughout my playthrough I would revel at the environments and Adams glorious beard. Prague at night with rain is jaw droppingly gorgeous with how good it looks.

-Side missions. The side missions steal the show in Mankind divided with many of them having better writing and level design than the main plot. Whether its stopping a cult on the sewer, kidnapping a mob boss son for a shotgun wedding, stopping a serial killer from claiming another victim. The side mission are fantastic and are completely optional with some being easy to miss. If you just play the main missions you're missing out on half the game and some of the best levels.

-The story a well told story. Cyberpunk is one of my favorite genres. An underrated genre in movies and games. The game is a conspiracy based cloak and dagger illuminati pulling the strings,  plotting and scheming. All in a near future dystopia that doesnt seem too far fetch with corporations having all the power. Great voice acting from Elias Toufexis who returns as Adam Jensen.

- Gameplay is refined from Human Revolution. The game has more augmented powers and more ways to choose how you want to play. Want to play as a guns blazing character and leave no survivors or a stealth ninja that was never there? Maybe even both? Regardless of what you choose the gameplay is the best thing of Mankind Divided while not too different from HR it still has been tweaked and refined to near perfection. Deus Ex Mankind divided is by far has the best gameplay of a rpg. Few games come close to it in terms of player choice and versatility.

Cons:
-Microtransactions are annoying, unnecessary, and are locked with one playthrough you're pretty much paying for the cheat codes. That and you have to buy again if you start a new playthrough. Ridiculous and not worth it. The good thing is they're not necessary at all you can play the entire game without touching the microtransaction like I did. Still an annoyance that put people off from buying the game.

-Characters are not as good as Human Revolution. While I enjoyed the story I didn't like the new characters all that much I missed all the old characters from HR. The new ones like Miller, MacReady, and Chikane do not compete with Sarfi, Pritchard, and Malik. You can team up with Pritchard again in paid DLC, but thats behind a paywall. It sucks as he is a fan favorite and to lock behind paid content is unfortunate.

-The ending which is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I think its better than the press one of the four buttons ending of Human Revolution. It does set up a sequel and ends in a to be continued way. Which might not even happen. Due to Square Enix putting the game on Hiatus because the game sold poorly. Now the team focus on a Marvels Avengers game. Which sounds cool but, it will be awhile until we finish the Adam Jensen Trilogy. If Mankind Divided is the last game it ends in a cliffhanger and we don't see the final showdown between the Illuminati and Adam.

-Technical issues. A game this big and with this fidelity will of course have its issues. Frame Rate drops, physics glitching and some bugs. Nothing game breaking but it was annoying reloading a save because the character died because he ragdolled with the games physics, still was pretty funny actually.

Conclusion:
Deus Ex Mankind Divided is an instant classic that gets more hate then it actually deserves. The game tells a visceral dark cyberpunk story with great gameplay and it is one of the best games to come out of this generation. Its dirt cheap even with all the DLC and goes on sell regularly it was even free for the month of January 2018 for PS Plus users. I absolutely recommend Mankind Divided the amount of content and the price its a no brainer.  I say it is even better than Human Revolution with better gameplay and level design. Mankind Divided is a worthy sequel to Human Revolution and worthy of being a Deus Ex title.  9.0/10 - Deus Ex: Mankind Divided brings players back into the role of Adam Jensen in full force. The game provides an immersive experience that allows you to handle any situation the way you want. This game not only follows up its predecessor, it stands on its own as an excellent video game.",deu ex mankind divid latest came come legendari deu ex franchis mankind divid direct sequel human revolut return everyon favorit cyberpunk batman adam jensen quest stop terror new aug apartheid world mankind divid controversi game bad pr around start augment preorder fisco polit controversi aug live matter biggest one use singl player one playthrough microtransact essenti buy cheat code factor lead lack luster sale hiatu franchis squar enix put team work marvel game futur put indefinit hold mankind divid last deu ex game good deu ex mankind deserv fate got let find pro let start obviou graphic leagu better human revolut ugli yellow color pallet gone butt mani piss joke charact environ render photorealist play ps4 pro 4k tv mani time throughout playthrough would revel environ adam gloriou beard pragu night rain jaw droppingli gorgeou good look side mission side mission steal show mankind divid mani better write level design main plot whether stop cult sewer kidnap mob bos son shotgun wed stop serial killer claim anoth victim side mission fantast complet option easi miss play,1518307200,5

53784,514,1331,"This is a quality game with a lot of value. It's basically the star wars movies in a fun disney cartoon form factor. But it doesnt hold back in offering an intense experience.

TWILIGHT OF THE REPUBLIC playset follows the Clone Wars. And its told simply and directly. I personally would of liked a deeper narrative, at least offering us the opprotunity to explore a more detailed plot if we wanted. But instead Disney keeps it shallow, following events accurately enough but very condensed.

Graphics are remarkable. Blending Disney's signature art stylizations with look and feel of Star Wars. And the soundtrack is authentic. From John Williams original musicam score to the sound effects for blasters , ships , lightsaber and creatures.

Controls and Gameplay are solid. Its simple enough to get by with button mashing, yet the game gives us slightly more complex combos to unlock and master.  But the controls themselves work fine. And the addition of individual character Skill Trees was a great idea. Along with the character Leveling Up system. So you get a bit of a RPG game feel. An element I wish they went more in depth with.
 Also, the combat in this game can be pretty amazing. I was surprised out how intense this game can get If you master the combos and moves for the characters .
And something else that was a great idea , was this game lets us boost up the challenge. From Easy mode, all the way up to Extreme Mode of difficulty.

Replay value is moderate to high. And its especially high of you play Local Multiplayer and Co-Op with friends/family.
But single player is still alright after you complete the main story. You can go back to complete all the side challenges.
And as you may know, the Disney Infinity support and updates have stopped, so there won't be anymore updates or figures coming out til further notice. So that's a bummer.
 However, apart from this Twilight play set. Theirs the Rise Of the Empire Play set ( classic trilogy ) and The Force Awakens play set ( from new trilogy) and theres even Star Wars Rebels figures out.

So essentially this review sums up all the Star Wars sets, since ive played and beat all 3. And for a star wars fan , this should be a must have. It practically gives you everything Star Wars in one game.
I highly recommend this game and it has high replay value of you play two players.",qualiti game lot valu basic star war movi fun disney cartoon form factor doesnt hold back offer intens experi twilight republ playset follow clone war told simpli directli person would like deeper narr least offer u opprotun explor detail plot want instead disney keep shallow follow event accur enough condens graphic remark blend disney signatur art styliz look feel star war soundtrack authent john william origin musicam score sound effect blaster ship lightsab creatur control gameplay solid simpl enough get button mash yet game give u slightli complex combo unlock master control work fine addit individu charact skill tree great idea along charact level system get bit rpg game feel element wish went depth also combat game pretti amaz surpris intens game get master combo move charact someth el great idea game let u boost challeng easi mode way extrem mode difficulti replay valu moder high especi high play local multiplay coop friendsfamili singl player still alright complet main stori go back complet side challeng may know disney infin,1518307200,4
53785,4695,4335,"I purchased my copy of the game used from EBay for $24.

I enjoyed about the 1st 60% of the game.  After that the side missions began to feel repetitive and the game began to feel like a grind.  Also around 60% into the game the dialog of the the 3 AIs assigned to your team began to become very irritating because it was the same stuff repeated again and again.

In my opinion the game was just too big and by the end I was just wanting to get through with it so I could move on to another game.  One thing I wish all game makers would do is like Rockstar does on some of their games - give you an option to, either replay or skip a portion of a mission after three unsuccessful tries.

I did get a number of hours enjoyment from the game so am not too disappointed at a $24 price.  Would not recommend paying more than that.  The main story missions were fairly interesting.  The graphics was good.  Weapon choices were good, player mechanics were okay.

53795,751,4203,"Resident Evil is a game that introduced a lot of people to the wonders that is the PS1. I remember watching people play it when I was about 11 and it scared me to death, but I still loved watching. Now over 20 years later a lot of the scares aren't as effective and the jumps are laughable.

If you are as familiar with this game as I am, you can probably get to the guardhouse in less than an hour. Enter, RE Deadly Silence. The game offers the classic mode  which is the original game with some tweaks  and it offers the rebirth mode. This is the mode for people that have beaten the game too many times to count and know all the tricks. It is a neat addition, with some odd quarks worth mentioning.

Lets go over the pros and cons of the new game mode.

Pros
1. Many of the puzzles are changed up to utilize the DS touch screen. Some people may not enjoy this mechanic, but I thought it was rather neat. The scale puzzle in the armor room was perfectly fine and I had no problem with the phonograph puzzle preceding the second Yawn fight. Granted some are changed for the worse (see con #1)

2. In each save room there is an additional chest that can be solved with a mini puzzle and will usually give the player ammo or health items.

3. At random intervals, between door loading screens, the player will be thrust into a first person POV and have to fight enemies with the knife (stylus). It is done to some varying degree of success (see con#2) but still keeps the game fresh. If you can get through the encounter without taking damage, you usually get ammo item for your troubles.

4. Chimera is introduced WAY earlier in the game. Instead of only being in the last 10 minutes like in the original game, they are littered throughout the tunnel sections of the game. Pretty cool

Cons
1. There are two puzzles that are changed for the worst in the rebirth mode.

A) The room where you get the red jewel out of the deer trophy. In order to extinguish the light in the room, you must blow out the candles using the DS microphone. Unfortunately for me, my mic is non working, so I couldn't get the jewel and thus couldn't get the magnum  the most powerful gun in the game. Little unfair for those that might not have a properly working DS. This also affects an earlier section in the game when playing as Jill and you encounter Richard after he has been bitten by the snake. You need to blow into the mic again to perform mouth to mouth. Since my mic is broken, you have to watch him slowly die and miss out on the radio.

B) When you go into the lab and you enter the room to release the water from that area, there is a button to push. In the original game, you push the button and the water drains away. Pretty simple. Now when you push the button, the sprinkler system activates flooding the room with poisonous water. You then have to use the stylus to operate a circular lever to drain the water within allotted time. If you go too slowly, you get poisoned. Good luck finding a Blue Herb in time.

2. The first person POV battle sequences are fine for the most part, though after a while they do get a little tedious. The zombies are super easy to kill, but the hunters are a little tough and the dogs/crows are downright cheap. Hunters stand a little lower than zombies and require more accurate swipes, while the crows and dogs launch at the screen and can be a difficult to time your attack properly. It can be pretty annoying to go down a health status from these unavoidable scenarios when you have no means to heal yourself.

3. There is a MAJOR story element change in the rebirth mode that I cannot get behind. It sounds neat in theory, but if you play the game normally with the general pace of the original mode, you will be very sad and require MUCH backtracking (like me). In the original game, you leave the mansion, go to the guardhouse, go to back to the mansion, then go down the ladder in the courtyard to the underground tunnels to get the doom books to access the final area in the game. (My memory is a little hazy, but that is more or less the order)  However, in the rebirth mode you only find ONE doom book in the tunnel area. So where is the other one? Well you have to backtrack to the guardhouse and have a new POV fight with the Yawn. Then you get the second book. You would never know that. Again, kind of a neat idea, but not really excited to have another fight with the Yawn with only my knife.

Additional thoughts

1. Having the map on the second screen is extremely helpful. Makes traveling the mansion a lot easier. It also blinks according to your health status, which is equally useful.

2. Load times are nonexistent. You can watch the door open and close animation if you want, but you can easily skip them. The power of cartridge vs disc.

3. The Knife is mapped to your L button and doesnt take up inventory space. Very cool

4. Quick turn is added from RE 3.

5. It is pretty amazing that they were able to cram a complete PS1 game onto a DS cart. Even has all of the FMV, even if they are a little grainy.

Thats about it. Very faithful port of the original with a neat twist in rebirth mode. Some odd puzzle elements really keep this game from being the perfect version of RE1, but it is still fun. I would definitely recommend this to all fans. For first time players, be sure to play classic mode first.",resid evil game introduc lot peopl wonder ps1 rememb watch peopl play 11 scare death still love watch 20 year later lot scare arent effect jump laughabl familiar game probabl get guardhous le hour enter deadli silenc game offer classic mode origin game tweak offer rebirth mode mode peopl beaten game mani time count know trick neat addit odd quark worth mention let go pro con new game mode pro 1 mani puzzl chang util d touch screen peopl may enjoy mechan thought rather neat scale puzzl armor room perfectli fine problem phonograph puzzl preced second yawn fight grant chang wors see con 1 2 save room addit chest solv mini puzzl usual give player ammo health item 3 random interv door load screen player thrust first person pov fight enemi knife stylu done vari degre success see con2 still keep game fresh get encount without take damag usual get ammo item,1518393600,4

However, in order to use them (after so many updates, so many reissues of the console), I had to buy this piece of trash just to get the USB cable that allows you to connect any other 3.5mm headphones to the PS3. Why not to sell it separately? No idea. The usb cable does work and it even has a volume control on it, doesn't seem to be fragile, so that is a plus. My luck is that I got this for 25$ refurbished.

53851,612,3992,"I really liked the first Dishonored. I consider it one of my favorite games and can I say that Dishonored 2 lives up to the glory of its predecessor? No, I can't.

The story is very-very simple. The game, actually, starts pretty good in terms of story-telling, there is a very interesting cinematic moment that sets up the whole game, but after that moment most of the story is told very briefly through a 1-2 minute long scene that is not even animated, it's just still images with voice-over. I've stopped playing at chapter 5 and the story stopped there. I mean, the first game was not ground-breaking in terms of story and characters, but it was passable. This game - it's simply a repeat of the old formula of a lone wolf, and it's very weird because both heroes are ex-heads of the empire, yet they have no connections, no money and it feels like Emily was not an empress at all.
Characters are all dull and there is no development whatsoever. Dialogue is pretty much shortened to ""you have to sneak there and kill that guy"".

Sound effects and music are quite weak, as well. Voice-over - terrible! The first game actually had a much better cast, but here - no one cares about performance, they just read the lines in ""cool"" voices. And I specifically look at you, the actor of Corvo.

Gameplay is the thing this game gets a lot of praise for. Well, I have to say that it's not as it was advertised. There is certainly no ""choose your way"" of play. Stealth is extremely boring and quick, all-out killing is just dull. The only proper way to enjoy the gameplay is to collect every single rune available on the level (which is too tedious to do since there are tons of them), so you can unlock all the extra abilities, and killing everyone you see from behind. So, there is only one way to enjoy this game and ""choose your way"" is simply a lie.
Speaking of killing, this game has a very weird moral system, which basically encourages you to NOT kill anybody, yet the game throws all these various items, techniques of killing without introducing anything interesting in terms of ""veggie"" play. So, if you like to get good endings, prepare for a boring gameplay.

Controls on PS4 are very bad. I mean, really. It is too hard to get used to them, so when you end up in a fight, you lose not because you did something wrong but because you're fighting with both the enemy and the control system. This game can only be enjoyed with a keyboard, and that's it. There is no way around it.

Graphics are kind of terrible. The art-style from the first game is present here, but it doesn't work. Mainly, because in the first one pretty much each level was crafted with the art-style in mind, in this game I completed 5 chapters and only one level actually worked well with the art-style, the others - just bleak and dull. And remember how much developers talked about whales in this game? I've only seen one. Yeah.
Not to mention that after all the patches, the game still performs terrible on a Slim PS4. There is constant drop of frame-rate in big locations and my question is: if huge games with a ton of detail like GTA 5 and Uncharted 4 work well on any PS4, why is this game so terrible and laggy?

Lastly, the AI. It's laughable. I played on a medium difficulty and the guards wouldn't see me when I was standing right next to them, they're just stupid. And let me give you another example. In the first chapter I entered some house, I look through the lock to see if there are any guards in the next room and I see one walking in circles with one of his legs inside a bath bowl. So, he walks and drags that bowl with him while saying something. It was ridiculous.

I am giving this game 1 star out of 5. It is an absolute garbage with no interesting story, characters, with a dull and stupid gameplay and horrible, absolutely horrible voice-over. I really hope these actors will never ever give their voice to any character.

53916,256,4422,"Let's start off with the new Battle System which is the best in the series in terms of accessibility.

The core battle system still retains the traditional one limb, one button attack functionality with spacing, air combos, parry, side steps, and timing is crucial to victory.

Added are:
-Power Crush- moves that absorb damage from a mid or a high attack, and it still continues despite taking damage. Sort of like focus attacks in SFIV

-Rage Mode. When a character is at 25% health they can do a Rage Art or Rage Drive.

Rage Arts are basically Ultimate/Super moves, and Rage Drives expand move list to where you can do lengthier combos. If you preform a Rage Art it'll cancel out the range mode regardless if you land it or not. Rage Arts can easily be block if your opponent sees it coming.

This mode makes the game more intense as there's a huge comeback factor if the opponent doesn't finish you off quickly have you hit the 25% health threshold. Both modes are be easily blocked though, so it's a risk reward mechanic.

 -Slow motion feature. The game will go into slow motion when two characters at low health attack simulatniously making the finishing attacks more cinematic

-Damage scaling: longer combos do less damage as more hits land, so skilled players cannot land a touch of death

There's no tutorial mode which is very disappointing as you have to figure the basics on your own or look up online guides.

Character Roster. There's a total of  40 playable fighters. There are new characters, but most of them are somewhat clones of old characters, but different look and backstory.

New characters include:
Akuma (from Capcom's Street Fighter)
Claudio Serafino
Geese Howard (SNK's fighting series (DLC))
Gigas
Jack-7
Josie Rizal
Katarina Alves
Kazumi Mishima
Lucky Chloe
Master Raven
Noctis Lucis Caelum (from Final Fantasy (DLC))
Shaheen

Returning characters include:
Alisa Bosconovitch
Asuka Kazama
Bob Richards
Bryan Fury
Devil Jin
Eliza (DLC)
Eddy Gordo
Feng Wei
Heihachi Mishima
Hwoarang
Jin Kazama
Kazuya Mishima
King II
Kuma II
Lars Alexandersson
Lee Chaolan /Violet
Leo Kliesen
Lili De Rochefort
Ling Xiaoyu
Marshall Law
Miguel Caballero Rojo
Nina Williams
Panda
Paul Phoenix
Sergei Dragunov
Steve Fox
Yoshimitsu

Missing characters from the roster that tend to be mainstays are Anna, Armored King, baek, bruce, Kunimitsu, ganryu, marduk, Mokujin, Julia, roger, Lei, wang...which is somewhat disappointing. Would be great if they release them for free as DLC like Tekken 5, but seeing that there's a season pass they most likely going to be pay-to-play

Modes:
-Story Mode
There's a story mode this time around focusing on souly on Kazuya and Heihachi's rivalry starting with in infamous tossing down cliff scene we see throughout the series. Akuma (from Street Fighter) gets shoehorned in as a hitman hired by Heihachi's wife, Kazumi from beyond the grave to kill both Kazuya and Heihachi.

It's a full length story mode like Mortal Kombat where you play several character matches as you progress; instead of a character select where you get intro and ending like past past games in the series*.  The story last maybe 3-4 hours depending on your skill level/difficulty selected.
There are individual character side stories you can play through, but they amount to a text opening and a ending cinematic scene when you win one match against your rival. I actually prefer this over tagging it onto arcade mode for immediate gratification.

-Arcade Mode. Very typical a series of 5 matches leading up to a boss battle in the end.

-Treasure Mode. Is an endless fight mode where you get in-game currency and treasure chests as you win more matches. Treasure chest contains in-game currency, customization items/costumes for each character, online player icons/tags, etc. At times there will be random battle scenarios like double damage, faster speed or a boss fight

You can also unlock customization items/costumes via in-game currency also, but some costumes/items are locked via treasure mode or paid DLC. Paid DLC costumes are basically just swimsuits for individual characters.

Seeing that it's the 20th anniversary of the Tekken series, the disc contains all Tekken opening movies, TV spots/trailers, and concept art of all 9  mainline Tekken games (Tekken 1-7 + Tekken Tag Tourament 1 &2). These can also be unlocked by spending in-game currency.

-Online. Very smooth with your typical ranked, tournament and quick play modes. If you plan to play ranked there may be long queue times to start a match. Luckily the loading screen let you practice combos and moves until they match you up with someone

-Tunes/Jukebox
For those who like background music. You can select from songs from the entire series all the way back to Tekken (1).

-Paid DLC
There is paid DLC, but not to the extent of lootboxes or treasure chests in this case. The DLC in this game include Tekken Bowl, Geese Howard (from SNK's fighting series), Noctis (from Final Fantasy XV), Eliza, and the mentioned swim suit costume unlocks

-Trophies.
A platinum trophy is easy to get as most of the trophies revolve around grinding for in-game cash, doing a particular set of moves, and finishing the story on any difficulty. The most difficult trophy may be to win a tourament mode online if you're new or not good at fighting games, but with enough practice or with friend invites who let you win; a platinum trophy is not difficult to obtain.

-PS VR.
There's VR mode. But don't have PS VR so can't give you my opinion on it.

Overall, an excellent Tekken game, but may be off putting for those new to the series with no tutorial mode. Luckily there are online guides you can search for to help you out with that",let start new battl system best seri term access core battl system still retain tradit one limb one button attack function space air combo parri side step time crucial victori ad power crush move absorb damag mid high attack still continu despit take damag sort like focu attack sfiv rage mode charact 25 health rage art rage drive rage art basic ultimatesup move rage drive expand move list lengthier combo preform rage art itll cancel rang mode regardless land rage art easili block oppon see come mode make game intens there huge comeback factor oppon doesnt finish quickli hit 25 health threshold mode easili block though risk reward mechan slow motion featur game go slow motion two charact low health attack simulatni make finish attack cinemat damag scale longer combo le damag hit land skill player cannot land touch death there tutori mode disappoint figur basic look onlin guid charact roster there total 40 playabl fighter new charact somewhat clone old charact differ look backstori new charact includ akuma capcom street fighter claudio serafino gee howard snk fight seri dlc giga jack7 josi rizal katarina,1518652800,5

53941,2121,2752,"You can get this very cheap now on Xbox One and having never played it before I thought I'd share my quick thoughts on it as I've been a long time fan of the series. Far Cry 2 is easily the most divisive game in the series. It seems to be an acquired taste. From what I can gather people who like it really enjoy the many challenges and harder aspects of it. Similarly the same features that many like are also seen as an annoyance by many others. The African setting is also something that draws may draw you in. As for my experience with the game, it's been interesting but I can't say that I see myself finishing this. In fact I'm surprised at how dated the game is, although maybe I shouldn't be. After playing 3 and 4 it's pretty hard to go back to this. One thing I noticed fairly early on is that pretty much every mission seems to be the same.

Minimal fast travel means you'll be driving a lot to your mission location, doing basically the same kind of mission as before, and then driving again to another location to do another mission. You won't want to walk because the map is huge and you move very slowly. When you sprint you can only do so in a forward direction, you cannot move direction while sprinting. I guess I was just surprised at how clunky everything is. Others have said they felt the same way almost 10 years ago when the game came out so perhaps it's just poor design. The shooting is okay but it's clearly not as fluid as the more recent Far Cry games, it's very noticeable. Speaking on the map, it's completely empty. It's big and there's outposts and different terrain but there's nothing really to explore or do. There is also no aggressive wild life to speak of, which is disappointing.  You'll mostly want to stick to the roads too, you kind of have to with the cars cause you don't really be able to go off road as rocks and other things will block your way and mess up your jeep or whatever your driving. And as I said you won't be walking your way around so the game kind of funnels you down these paths meaning you'll run into the outposts which leads me to my next complaint- the outposts respawn. Some say this brings challenge, others say it's an annoyance. I tend to agree that it's annoying mainly because the game encourages these constant encounters and these outposts will even chase you down if you drive by. There seems to be only a few things you can do in this world, you can take over outposts, capture safe houses, hunt for diamonds, buy weapons and upgrades, and of course do missions and progress the story. The main problem I'm encountering is that everything is extremely repetitive, there's hardly any mission variety. With what little there is to do in the world, there doesn't seem to even be much meat to what's there. So far, it's just rinse and repeat, with a very uninteresting story that offers no explanation for what I'm even doing there. Far Cry 2 laid the ground work for the other games in the series but I'm not seeing much of a game here in terms of an investment. I like to make big time investments in my games and there's just not enough going on here for me to be able to do that. I'll update this review later if my opinions change or if I ever get around to completing the game.",get cheap xbox one never play thought id share quick thought ive long time fan seri far cri 2 easili divis game seri seem acquir tast gather peopl like realli enjoy mani challeng harder aspect similarli featur mani like also seen annoy mani other african set also someth draw may draw experi game interest cant say see finish fact im surpris date game although mayb shouldnt play 3 4 pretti hard go back one thing notic fairli earli pretti much everi mission seem minim fast travel mean youll drive lot mission locat basic kind mission drive anoth locat anoth mission wont want walk map huge move slowli sprint forward direct cannot move direct sprint guess surpris clunki everyth other said felt way almost 10 year ago game came perhap poor design shoot okay clearli fluid recent far cri game notic speak map complet empti big there outpost,1518739200,3

53950,514,3919,"One of the best games ever made and one of my all time favorites. Great story that is vast and intricate. The environments and locations are a thrill to explore, from shimmering lakesides , and flowering fields to treacherous mountains and creepy caves that seem to be without end.
 If you love JRR Tolkien's Lord of The Rings and Hobbit stories or any classic fantasy worlds such as Conan The Barbarian , Or The Legend Of Zelda for NES or The old DragonQuest games on NES ( known as Dragon Warrior)
Or the game called Wizardy. You should buy this now.

Outstanding memorable soundtrack that stands alongside the best theme music and film scores ever made. Unforgettable.

Solid controls and gameplay. When you pick up a giant sword or war hammer to clobber a monster , you can just almost feel the weight haha. It's not a super stylized fighting mechanic , but it reprelicates the brutality of real battle close enough. Very straight forward controls. You can use magic for one hand or both. Or you carry a shield and sword. Or if you want to just carry a huge Dragon slaying weapon with two heads, then have at it. And don't forget the Bow and Arrow.
 Also, you can choose to charge in and just kill relentlessly , or you can sneak around like a ninja and he a stealth assassin. And I cant forget that you can do all this on a horse as well. Yes. You can attack someone while riding a horse and slash at them while you ride passed them. Or take aim at a menacing fire spitting Dragon , riding a horse up a jagged hill side , shooting your trusty arrows. It's amazing.

There's so much to immerse yourself with. You can even collect and read passages from lots of books. And learn lots of history and lore and useful tactics. Isn't that wonderful?

If you want, you can cook and make recipes. You can make your own armor and sheilds and clothes and magic potions and all types of things.

You will see Giants....Skeletons...sorcerers and witches....even vampires and werewolves. And of course Dragons , and other massive creatures, including Spiders.
I personally love fighting a horde of Skeletons.

53957,5180,3873,"When Dice first announced the setting for this game - scratch that: when rumors started circling before the announcement that the next Battlefield would be set in WWI, I lost my mind a little bit. The setting is almost completely ignored in modern games, but ripe for adventure and heroic exploits. While I'm not a Battlefield regular, I did play Bad Company 2 and loved that campaign, and I'm fairly familiar with the multiplayer sandbox that is regular Battlefield. The final product toyed with my expectations a little bit, but more or less proved that WWI is a fine setting for a videogame.

The campaign itself is less a campaign, more a series of vignettes telling various stories, but they're great stories. Replayability is spotty, but it exists, since there are multiple achievements and medals you can earn for finding items, or using particular strategies. Overall I was a little disappointed with the total playtime of the single-player content, and feel that a bigger and better story could have been told. But it's still very enjoyable and visually stunning - and quite authentic.

The multiplayer side is a mixed bag. There are lots of ways to play within the four distinct classes, but few are very balanced. There are definitely ways to play to win, which require a lot of playtime put in to unlock better weapons, and don't encourage a lot if experimentation. Which is too bad, since the quirky weapon set is fun to unlock and use, including some of the more outlandish types of weapons I've ever seen in a realistic shooter. I wish these were easier to unlock, as you don't get much experience per time spent in game (matches are usually close to a half hour in length). The game interface and menus feel hamstrung when you don't pay for DLC. Since I have only the base game, content feels very sparse. Overall I don't approve of the way this game is set up, nor the amount of content versus what's walled away behind experience. but for such a novel setting, they could hardly have done better bringing it to life.",dice first announc set game scratch rumor start circl announc next battlefield would set wwi lost mind littl bit set almost complet ignor modern game ripe adventur heroic exploit im battlefield regular play bad compani 2 love campaign im fairli familiar multiplay sandbox regular battlefield final product toy expect littl bit le prove wwi fine set videogam campaign le campaign seri vignett tell variou stori theyr great stori replay spotti exist sinc multipl achiev medal earn find item use particular strategi overal littl disappoint total playtim singleplay content feel bigger better stori could told still enjoy visual stun quit authent multiplay side mix bag lot way play within four distinct class balanc definit way play win requir lot playtim put unlock better weapon dont encourag lot experiment bad sinc quirki weapon set fun unlock use includ outlandish type weapon ive ever seen realist shooter wish easier unlock dont get much experi per time spent game match usual close half hour length game interfac menu feel hamstrung,1518739200,4

53989,5180,929,"I'm giving this game a rating of four stars, though my personal experience was closer to five. Taking in some bugs and slight clunkiness in story and objectives this is a solid four.

I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I was a youngster, and the recent portrayals in popular culture have nearly all been great. This is a smaller but equally fun take, with a great character model and voice for Sherlock. It hits on many classic settings that are quite evocative of original stories, but are new cases, like a salty old sea captain, a Greco-Roman-inspired cult, and the political machinations of various growing South American countries. Each case has memorable characters, events and settings. The actual gameplay is on the slower side, emphasizing the gathering of clues and observations of visual cues during interviews. A somewhat trippy interface allows you to connect clues by making certain inferences, leading to (hopefully) an eventually solid accusation. This game is somewhat unique in that it allows you to accuse the wrong person, based on - sometimes quite plausible - incorrect conclusions from the evidence gained. You are then treated to a bit of continuation of story which will show you the consequences of your choice. Since Sherlock is so well respected by members of Scotland Yard, they take his explanation and prosecute accordingly, so it's funny to see how a leap in logic is then solemnly executed by the boys in blue.

While the game is sometimes plodding, and occasionally frustrating when objectives aren't clearly explained or when a small detail is missed, this can easily be set back on course using a guide or other resource form the internet, and this only popped up once or twice in the course of the game. When played with an appreciation of setting and classic Sherlock sleuthing, this game really comes into its own. It's part adventure game, part point-and-click, part action game.

While this is a terrific standalone game, there have been entries both before and after this one that just don't work as well. On the one hand, if you enjoyed this game and want to experience more of it, it's fairly disappointing that the other games aren't as good. On the other hand, if you tried one of the others and didn't like it, it may still be worth your while to give this title a try.

53990,9390,1374,I sold my PS3 copy because I decided I wanted to make the upgrade and get Deadpool for the PS4. Sadly Deadpool for the PS4 is more of a downgrade than an upgrade. First of all the graphics look EXACTLY the same as they do on the PS3. Secondly the frame rate drops so bad that it acts like it might freeze up. There was even a time where the sound cut out for 30 seconds to a minute. What's even more ridiculous is it would only take one simple update to fix this game but the developers seem to be too lazy and incompetent to fix their game.

54013,9214,1579,"The very first Cooking Mama game in the franchise. This game is very fun. A lot more challenging than the newer Cooking Mama games. I've had to do the same recipes multiple times to get a gold medal. It made me a bit frustrated, but none the less, I'm glad I have the game in my collection. It's still a great game, and is one on my top three favorite Mama games list. This of course wasn't my first Cooking Mama game. My first was actually Cooking Mama 4 Kitchen Magic for the 3DS. That's how I fell in love with the Cooking Mama series. Since I have all the Mama games for the 3DS. I decided to get the ones for the DS. This was the first one I picked up for the DS. Used of course, but the game came complete with case, and manuals, just the way I like my games to come, and in immaculate condition.

It had a Gamestop sticker on it from the previous owner, but was easily removed, along with a small piece of paper that was under the plastic on the edge/hinges of the case. That was also a price tag. The case as well when I opened it had a Gamestop receipt from 7/7/10. That put a smile on my face. Seeing that the seller probably only open the case to see if the game was in there, and closed it back up, not taking the time to test the game, and clean it up a bit. But that's okay with me. But testing the game to see if it works might've been a safe thing to do. Or maybe they did, who know. But anyway the previous owner paid $16.19 for the game with their Gamestop rewards card. The game was used even back then when that person purchased it and the price was $17.99. The game card came in good condition, but was a bit dirty on the back. Looks like maybe food, or something. It was removed with ease with a damp paper towel. So the little flaws that was on the case, and game card was easily removed, and I was able to restore it to it's original condition. The game also had a save file on there. That made me wonder why the person gave up their copy, and never really completed it. Maybe they got frustrated as well. Oh well. I deleted the original file on there, and started fresh. Not a big deal at all. Most used games comes with a save file on it. Not a big deal what so ever. It can be deleted. Now I'm not saying all sellers that will be selling used games on here will be just as good or even better than the one I bought the game from. But when you do research on that seller. You most likely will be happy with your purchase. I know I am.

Anyway if you're a Mama fan, and didn't start off with the first of the series, and want to like I did. I highly recommend getting yourself a copy of this game. You will really enjoy this game. It's challenging, but very tranquil at the same time. It's very family friendly, not harsh in any way. Any kid will get frustrated, and cry because the game is very challenging. Time does go much faster than the newer Cooking Mama games. But that is what makes it fun. Maybe this game is too challenging for younger kids. It could be why the Cooking Mama games became watered down over time. I like that it's more of a challenge. It makes me feel like I actually had to work my butt off to get gold in everything. But anyway. It's a good game to play with 3 other people with just one single game card via download play. It has 76 dishes, and you can also combine dishes as well.",first cook mama game franchis game fun lot challeng newer cook mama game ive recip multipl time get gold medal made bit frustrat none le im glad game collect still great game one top three favorit mama game list cours wasnt first cook mama game first actual cook mama 4 kitchen magic 3d that fell love cook mama seri sinc mama game 3d decid get one d first one pick d use cours game came complet case manual way like game come immacul condit gamestop sticker previou owner easili remov along small piec paper plastic edgehing case also price tag case well open gamestop receipt 7710 put smile face see seller probabl open case see game close back take time test game clean bit that okay test game see work mightv safe thing mayb know anyway previou owner paid 1619 game gamestop reward card game,1518825600,5

54023,751,4212,"Fire Emblem never really wowed me with its story. In my opinion, the series shines through interesting characters and the battle mechanics. The story usually involves being plopped in the middle of a war, multiple factions want to rule, and you have to murder anyone in your path. Not exactly Shakespeare. Raidant Dawn has plenty of interesting characters and the battle mechanics are very true to the series. However, there are a good amount of flaws inherent within in the game that keep it from being really good.

1. Right off the bat, before even starting the game, you are going to make a grave mistake. You will choose a difficulty setting of Normal, as you have played FE before and are pretty adept to SRPGs in general. However, based on my experience, and some internett research, the game's difficulties are a flat out lie. From what I have gathered on FE forums, gamefaqs, and other such sites, the difficulties when localized from Japan were erroneously tagged. In Japan the options are Normal, Hard, Insane. In American it is changed to Easy Normal Hard. So see how that is messed up? By selecting Normal, you are actually selecting the Hard difficulty without even knowing it. You will waste countless hours fighting the game because your EXP gain is slow and you are under leveled. Pick Easy, that is the Normal Difficultly originally.

2. There is no way to speed up or skip the enemy phase. Boy, I don't understand why this was introduced so late in the series. It is such a slog to have to watch your enemy movements and then any ally movements before you can go. A 10 minute fight could easily double in length because of all the needless time wasting.

Additional thoughts - don't pay anything over 50$ for this game. It is an ok entry in the series, but I have enjoyed the 3DS line much more.

Bottom Line - get the game if you are an absolute fan. It is a little on the expensive side, especially for something used. For newcomers, I would suggest starting at Awakenings on the 3DS and continue from there. All of the quality of life changes made to the series on the 3DS really make it hard to go back and play this game.",fire emblem never realli wow stori opinion seri shine interest charact battl mechan stori usual involv plop middl war multipl faction want rule murder anyon path exactli shakespear raidant dawn plenti interest charact battl mechan true seri howev good amount flaw inher within game keep realli good 1 right bat even start game go make grave mistak choos difficulti set normal play fe pretti adept srpg gener howev base experi internett research game difficulti flat lie gather fe forum gamefaq site difficulti local japan erron tag japan option normal hard insan american chang easi normal hard see mess select normal actual select hard difficulti without even know wast countless hour fight game exp gain slow level pick easi normal difficultli origin 2 way speed skip enemi phase boy dont understand introduc late seri slog watch enemi movement alli movement go 10 minut fight could easili doubl length needle time wast addit thought dont pay anyth,1518825600,3

Overall I'm impressed and would recommend to other gamers :) and before I forget..you will need a aux cable to plug into the amp shown in the pic and from the amp connect the aux cord to controller..now like I said if you want chat..you will need a coverter adapter..you can buy them for 25-30 bucks on amazon and they will ship them deals fast :)",reason pick 5 star simpli hook xbox one tri fuzzi first rememb thisif fuzzi first make sure plug usb port power amplifi usb usb need convert adapt want sound astro 40 sound 25 much better also xbox one set got audio chang set stereo compress window sonic headphon give much better sound overal im impress would recommend gamer forgety need aux cabl plug amp shown pic amp connect aux cord controllernow like said want chatyou need covert adaptery buy 2530 buck amazon ship deal fast,1518912000,5

Unless you really dig around in the answered questions, you will assume that it works with dance mats. Well you'd be wrong, as the drivers for this product only allow controllers with thirteen buttons and two joysticks to be used. This means that it will work with ps2 joystick controllers, but not dance pads. This was a huge letdown, and made the product borderline useless for my purpose.

Now because it does do what it's supposed to, I can't make this a one star review.

Cons:
later guns and armor are super expensive you would have to: (A) Grind for days or (B) Play the whole game ten times to get anything
cause the devs are idiots and made fake numbers
starting weapons and saved data of the first game of guns become a joke and do nothing for damage
Enemies have annoying autoaim/aimbot
Enemies are damage sponges and deal alot of pain
Leveling up is broken. even on new planets and hard enemies. weapons still don't level up fast enough
its a waste of my time to grind when i could do a little, get everything upgraded and move one. but no
the game is made poorly by idiots. poor and lazy check points, hard to reach areas. the two races are broken and sloppy
space battles with enemies that constantly attack you and will need to grind for crystals to power your ship. seeing the pattern here?
they should re-name this to: The Grinding Game from Hell
the camera is your enemy, its slow and stubborn
the game robs you of bolts in order to progress, gotta pay some robots 6,000 bolts, a TV 10,000 and a thief 20, 000. wow thanks game, not like things are ultra expensive, oh wait, things are super expensive.
also the ship has more colors then parts? WHY?

54199,1327,78,"This mouse has a great amount of things going for it. The sensor is a flawless sensor with high, tunable DPI (and a variety of other parameters). A major plus for me is that with the default side grip in place, the sides are tall and flat. This means that I can pretty much use the mouse ambidextrously and always have a nice grip up front for my fourth and fifth fingers. In Sensei-styled mice, this front edge usually tapers and gives me a worse grip. The main part of the mouse is also nice and wide, allowing for my hand to be spread out and reduce cramping. I got the non-aluminum version because I wanted a lower overall weight. But if you like heavier mice, the aluminum version would be the way to go.
*update after 30 days: with regular use, one of the mice I ordered started double-clicking on it's own. I confirmed this using http://unixpapa.com/js/testmouse.html to test my sanity; and the mouse. Oddly enough, I think I may have fixed the problem by simply clicking the left mouse button more towards the side where I noticed it wasn't triggering the double click as often. Now when I click in the middle or more towards the wheel, which is normal for me, the double clicking problem appears to have diminished or resolved. Still dinging a star for this odd problem.
*update at 4 months: one of the mice I ordered had the scroll ring and rubber ring become unglued causing scrolling to become an issue. After reporting this to Corsair, I've had to go through a week of firmware and software troubleshooting because they seem incapable of understanding I want an RMA because physical components came unglued. Dinging another star from this review because potential buyers will have to deal with this type of insufferable customer support if they make a purchase.

54221,4217,4007,"Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of the classics of gamings second golden age (roughly 2007  2013). Story, music, characters, gameplay are all of the highest order. Belongs in the library of every gamer who appreciates story-telling mixed with stealth-action gameplay. Worth the purchase price of $20, but frequently discounts to $5 or less, where it is an incredible bargain.
Total size on my hard-drive: 18.2 GB

The Directors Cut Edition adds some visual tweaks and re-designed boss-battle environments. The Missing Link DLC is included, folded into the main story campaign.

+ Story with serious themes. Starts with a literal bang and is paced well.
+ Relevant side-quests that can contain important backstory.
+ Choices matter.
+ Voice-acting is excellent.
+ Superb soundtrack by Michael McCann. Synth-orchestral sound with a techno feel at times.
+ Multiple ways to play (with the right upgrades). Stealth? Shooter? Fall safely from any height? Punch walls (discovering new passages)? Up to you. High replayability.
+ Multiple level paths. Youll end up at the same objective, but there are at least two paths to get there (and there are frequently more).
+ The Directors Cut features completely revamped boss-battle environments. Stealth builds are now completely legit.
+ Addictive hacking mini-game. Its over in seconds, too, so it doesnt slow the gameplay down much.
+ Individual weapons. Decent selection, and they all look and feel unique.
+ Well-optimized, and not resource-intensive. Locked 60fps @1440 on an RX 470 with everything maxed except Depth of Field (which is an effect I dislike, so it was turned off). Back in the day, it played fine on the desktop APU I used to have (using the integrated graphics). If you have a low-spec computer and are looking for a good game to play, Human Revolution should be near the top of your list.

+/- Not an open world. Rather, a few small hub areas that have some side-missions. Allows for more focused level design, but can feel claustrophobic at times.
+/- The Missing Link DLC is included in the main campaign (right after leaving China for the second time). You lose all of your upgrades once this section of the game begins (though you get them back once this section is complete, PLUS any upgrades you accumulated). Generally, the insertion of the Missing Link DLC slows down the later part of the game, but narratively it makes complete sense. And Commander Burke is a great adversary.
+/- Graphics are fair. Light-shafts and shadows look great, but skyboxes look low-res and facial expressions are wooden. Edges are jaggy even with anti-aliasing cranked up (down-sampling is the best solution).

- Mouths frequently don't sync properly during conversations.
- UI doesnt scale properly. The HUD is tiny at 1440p; I cant imagine it at 4k.
- Some odd controls with kb + m. Right click and hold to enter cover. Iron sights is a toggle of the middle mouse button.
- Predictable, stupid enemy AI. Get even a few upgrades, and ghosting levels becomes incredibly easy.

Even with those few drawbacks, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is one of the very best stealth / role-playing / action hybrids. It belongs to none of those genres, but takes the best elements of each and adds in an emotional story whose morals exist in planes of grey. A game to play through, reflect upon, and play again. 9/10",deu ex human revolut one classic game second golden age roughli 2007 2013 stori music charact gameplay highest order belong librari everi gamer appreci storytel mix stealthact gameplay worth purchas price 20 frequent discount 5 le incred bargain total size harddriv 182 gb director cut edit add visual tweak redesign bossbattl environ miss link dlc includ fold main stori campaign stori seriou theme start liter bang pace well relev sidequest contain import backstori choic matter voiceact excel superb soundtrack michael mccann synthorchestr sound techno feel time multipl way play right upgrad stealth shooter fall safe height punch wall discov new passag high replay multipl level path youll end object least two path get frequent director cut featur complet revamp bossbattl environ stealth build complet legit addict hack minigam second doesnt slow gameplay much individu weapon decent select look feel uniqu welloptim resourceintens lock 60fp 1440 rx 470 everyth max except depth field effect dislik turn back day play fine desktop apu use use integr graphic lowspec comput look good game play human revolut near top list open world rather,1519257600,5

54247,3802,879,"I bought these to replace a ""high end"" Astro headset with an external amplifier. After it broke due to poor quality, and being out $200 for my trouble, I needed something that would work for long-term use.

Some looking around, and these kept coming up in people's recommendations. I pulled the trigger without reading all the way, expecting a bog standard, cheapo headset with the bog standard 3.5mm jack, something I'd probably use as a stopgap until finding something a bit more substantial.

My expectations were exceeded in just about every way possible!

Let's talk about comfort. The headset is light, without feeling cheap, which is a huge bonus for something being worn for hours at a time. There's enough padding on the headband that I don't have to worry about the plastic digging into my scalp. The earcups are just big enough, and despite having some misgivings when I first bought them and got my hands on em (the fabric feels ""crinkly"" in the hand), hours later, there's no fatigue. A pleasant surprise.

Sound quality is utterly equivalent, at least to my ears, with my previous Astro set which was connected over optical. In other words, excellent.

I used the USB adapter (which appears to the computer as a separate sound device). I just plugged it in and it worked, no messing around. And as an extra bonus, even though the description here says that it's only supported on Windows and Mac, it also works just fine on a modern Linux like Ubuntu 16 with equivalent quality.

With the possible exception of the garish color (I'm not a fan of the cyber-neon blue, to be honest), this is quite possibly the perfect headset, and it puts others that cost many times more to absolute shame.

  IGN: review on (Horizon Zero Dawn) an if you know (IGN) you know that a review like this must mean its a truly remarkable game
Theres something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon
Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after Id finished its main campaign some 40 odd hours later.

Superb graphics and environments. Weapon/gear crafting are also a great feature. This is the only game in all of the Tomb Raider games that I actually enjoyed playing. It still contains similar puzzles as all TR games do but it is also a shooter-style game. I personally think Crystal Dynamics ""borrowed"" some of the abilities from other games. The Survival Instinct is pretty much the same as Assassin's Creed Eagle Vision, the fast travel feature is almost the same as Assassin's Creed's fast travel, although you need to be at a base camp to use it. The only major downfall to this game as well as other TR games is the map. It's a terrible design.

54318,2280,1166,"This review is for the PS4 game.

Although this type of game is not necessarily my favorite type to play, but I did enjoy playing the Uncharted collection that came with my PS4 and decided to get this one when it dropped in price to under 20 bucks.

Like the previous games in the series, this has some beautifully done, well detailed graphics and scenery but it is the story and good character acting that really got me involved in the previous game.  Most of my favorite characters are back and well-acted by the individuals who voice them.  Uncharted has all those things that has made this a fun series to play with its blend of action and puzzle solving.  The game is solid and plays smoothly with no major issues at least for me.  Like the previous games, the game is pretty linear (although a little less so than the previous games) and can be completed in just a few hours of game time.  With that being said there are no major surprises in terms of the different sections of the game and will feel very familiar if you have played the previous games in the series.  It is also one of those games for me that doesnt have much replay-ability as a solo player unless you missed some of the collectables.  There is a multiplayer game if you like doing that.

It is still a fun and entertaining game to play, especially if you are a fan of the series.  For me, it was worth grabbing this when it went on sale as I am enjoying the Nathans adventure.

54321,9423,207,"Pros for me: Small mobile size, good for claw grip. No wire, so less drag and no possibility of a wire getting stuck up on something, and it does not drift when i let go of it (a problem when using a low drag mouse pad with a wired mouse). Perfect tracking. In 2.4 ghz mode, I did not perceive any more or less latency compared to using a wired mouse. Able to set DPI in increments of 100 in the software, and very wide range of DPIs. No software CD included, guided me to download installer when i plugged in the USB receiver. No restart required. Software is optional, can just use plug and play, but then can't change DPI. I feel that the mouse is built well. Comes with 2 AA Energizer alkaline batteries in the box. When the connection does drop with 2.4 ghz receiver, it is only for a split second, and it recovers ""lost"" mouse movement, so you do not have to correct for the lost signal by repeating the same movements again. The new beta version of Razer Synapse that installs with this mouse is really clean and modern looking, instead of having the dated gamer aesthetic of the previous version.

Cons for me: Kind of heavy with 2 AA batteries installed, have to overcome a lot of inertia and so is actually not so good for twitchy games in my opinion (but i can adjust to this). Rubber grips on sides are ironically slippery when hands are sweaty, more slippery than the textured plastic surface on the top of the mouse. Rubber also does not have longevity, it will get pretty gross and come apart over time. Connection is not too reliable with the 2.4 ghz receiver plugged in to my desktop under my desk, but i will get an extension cable to have it closer to the mouse. Razer Synapse software is a 100+ MB download with a lengthy install, not a serious problem in this present day of computing but it just seems way too large for something so basic (but it does manage settings for many other Razer products as well, not just this mouse). Requires you to make a Razer account, then to be online and to log in from the app, just to change DPI. That's asinine.

Other thoughts: I would have liked a built in rechargable lithium ion battery instead, for less weight and to not have to manage batteries.

54338,1501,4489,"This is absolutely the best gaming console I have ever owned. I love my Scorpio Edition! I have owned the first Atari and the next few generations of Atari. I have owned a first generation Nintendo (Think Super Mario Brothers.) And in the past decade I have owned the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One. I read several mixed reviews about the Xbox One X. Some people here on Amazon experienced some bad ones that were defective from the start. Some units shut down as soon as people would turn them on. Some people got an hour or two of use before it shutdown on them and would not power back up. I feel bad for them and Microsoft because it makes MS look bad and leaves a bad impression of the Xbox in their minds. Well, I could not be any happier with mine! Well I could of been happier if I had gotten it for free! Anyway, my Scorpio Edition works perfectly. I have had no issues with it what-so-ever. I have played a couple games on it for at least 5-6 hours a day the past couple of days and I am loving it! I tried a few older games just to see if they looked any better and they do. I did not have any games that were native 4K and HDR so I bought one that is. I bought ""Middle-earth: Shadow of War"" and let me tell you, this game looks amazing! I could go on and on about it but this review is about the Xbox One X, and not the game. But if you buy this console, you got to see this game on it!

54339,2535,1814,"It's the first musou game I actually enjoyed.

Granted, the last time I played one was probably Dynasty Warriors 3, and the franchise has seemingly advanced quite a bit since then. Room-clearing supers, team-up attacks, and all that have added to the ""run to place, fight until there is no more fighting"" formula that makes up most of this brawler series. Special achievements and requirements add a little more focus and things to do, as well as reasons to grind stages over and over to unlock one more thing. And there's always more to unlock and grind for.

The special superpowers and weapons of the One Piece cast are a great boon to the rest of this game, since their variety forced the devs to make a lot of different and unique effects. Some are better at clearing areas, some chain their attacks in interesting ways, others launch themselves around the battlefield - there's a lot of different playstyles to unlock. However, what you're doing with them most of the time - blowing away droves of enemies that present little threat - doesn't really change from character to character. Kicking things up to hard or facing a stage you're underleveled for is about the only time you might find too much difficulty outside of the challenges. Mind, losing a stage is really discouraged, as you lose everything but the XP gained - and given a stage can take a good 45 minutes to complete, that can can be really disheartening.

If you're not already into One Piece, though, this is not the place to start. The story is extremely abbreviated from that of the manga or anime, and leaves much unexplained under the presumption that players will already be familiar with the series. And, to be fair, compressing 15 years of manga continuity into a single game is a herculean task, and so they've aimed for a ""greatest hits"" sort of summary. It's appreciated that they use new 3d cutscenes rather than just cut-paste anime scenes, but it's still by and for the fans. Still, if you like a character, you can probably play them. If you like a story, there's probably a stage for it. It services the fans well, but likely leaves everybody else in the dust. Furthermore, it just kind of ends at the point they had in the manga at the time, so don't expect a big-wrap for the series.

The grind can be a little too heavy at times - later levels seem to presume you've taken some time to grind on the side, which isn't really welcome. Granted, replaying levels and gaining new bits is satisfying, but it shouldn't have been a necessity to pad out the game's length. There's even a big endgame series of levels for those who have maxed their characters or close enough to it, though they're mostly just remixes of existing content at higher level rather than a new story or tale.

Overall, though, it's probably the best One Piece game yet, and the flurry of blowing hundreds and thousands of enemies out of the way is very true to the series' feel. If you don't mind the rhythmic repetition of the musou games, of blowing away enemies until the climax of a super... rinse... repeat... this is absolutely a game for fans of the series. It's not deep, but it uses the wide cast and lore to create a delightfully violent playground. Though it's nothing too innovative, it is a satisfying and colorful brawler to pound your way through. If you're not into One Piece and you read this far... well, I recommend reading the manga as a goofy pirate battle comic, but this game isn't for you unless you're willing to do a little homework. (Even I had to do some catching up to do before I played some of the later levels.)

54345,2535,3957,"With all of the DLC installed, this is easily the best COD game in recent years.

The campaign tells a stellar story (excuse the pun) with amazing visuals and some really fun level design. The levels set exclusively in space - be it in your ship on assaulting an enemy cruiser - make use of some of the best controls for a space game I've seen to date, and cannot be faulted. The score for the game is also spectacular, but I won't get into that in too much detail.

The multiplayer definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea, but will be right up your alley if you enjoyed Black Ops 3's MP. I, personally, didn't get into it as much as I have in past games (I only made Prestige 1 or 2, I cannot remember), but all I have are good memories. Finding matches can be a pain at non-peak times (especially in DLC maps), but when you do get into a lobby you're gonna have a good time. The rig system of class customisation is similar to BO2 & 3's Pick 10 system, but it doesn't feel anywhere near as restrictive (as you can change your rig on the fly in game instead of being limited to one specialist player for each game). Maps are varied in size and layout, some better than others, with a few nice remastered classics thrown in. Gunplay is similar to Black Ops 3, but a little slower paced.

Zombies is where Infinite Warfare shines brightest though. The on disk Zombie map - Spaceland - is an absolute hoot, with bright lights, a killer soundtrack and a nice lighthearted spirit that's been missing from a lot of recent Zombies maps in other games. Spaceland is easily the best ""base"" zombies map since Kino Der Toten in Black Ops. The DLC maps are all radically different, and all knock it out of the park. The addition of the easter egg challenges that had started to get on my nerves by the end of Black Ops 3 was initially a turn-off for me, but all the Infinite Warfare ones feel like something new and rewarding - new characters, modes & customisation items, to name a few.

I firmly believe that this game deserves nowhere near as much hate as it received on launch, and will go down in a lot of players' memories as a high point in the series.",dlc instal easili best cod game recent year campaign tell stellar stori excus pun amaz visual realli fun level design level set exclus space ship assault enemi cruiser make use best control space game ive seen date cannot fault score game also spectacular wont get much detail multiplay definit isnt everyon cup tea right alley enjoy black op 3 mp person didnt get much past game made prestig 1 2 cannot rememb good memori find match pain nonpeak time especi dlc map get lobbi your gonna good time rig system class customis similar bo2 3 pick 10 system doesnt feel anywher near restrict chang rig fli game instead limit one specialist player game map vari size layout better other nice remast classic thrown gunplay similar black op 3 littl slower pace zombi infinit warfar shine brightest though disk zombi map spaceland absolut hoot bright light killer soundtrack nice lightheart spirit that miss lot recent zombi map game spaceland easili best base zombi map sinc kino der toten black op,1519516800,4

54378,9431,4503,"If you can believe it, I own all these versions of Skyrim: Skyrim SE on XB1 and PC, Skyrim Legendary on PS3, Xbox 360, Skyrim vanilla on Xbox 360 and PC and in total, I have over 2,000 hours on the various versions. I think I'll take a different angle at this review since the SE does bring a new feature to the XB1.

This version does come with all DLC, it's worth mentioning here that you cannot remove any of the DLC like you could on the Legendary edition, which simply means, the Vampire random attack parties start showing up at level 8. On Legendary, you could choose not to install Dawnguard until you wanted to deal with the vampires being a threat to your favorite merchants and other NPCs.

It also comes with fully ""new"" achievements, meaning if you have all achievements on Skyrim Legendary or vanilla, you can get them all again.  Using mods does disable achievements but Bethesda does have the Creation Club which offers paid mods that do not disable achievements. Some believe it's a controversial move but I haven't had any crash problems with the Creation Club mods but have with regular free mods.

The modding is the big, new feature and this is what I do since I want the achievements. I played my non-modded character for roughly 100 hours, up to level 55 with some power-leveling in there. I started getting bored and decided to try the modded character out. I did not start over. Instead, I loaded up 8-9 mods and continued from my last game.

This, to me, is very important. You can do what I did and what it does is start a new set of saves. Meaning, at any time, I can switch back to playing my unmodded level 55 character and still get achievements or can load my modded level 55 character and just have some silly fun. A few things worth mentioning, there are still bugs in the non-modded game, the quest, ""Blood on the ice"" in Windhelm wouldn't start for me but if I mod it and put the Unofficial patch in my mods, it lets me play that quest fully, which is relatively important since you'll need it to buy the Windhelm house Hjerim. There's no achievement tied to this quest so you get to play that quest, have access to one of the best houses on the game and lose nothing for doing it modded.

My goal is rather simple, complete all achievements, then switch to my modded character. The modded character allows much more immersion. In Skyrim you're limited to marrying from a set group of characters, you can only adopt 2 kids and you have very little control over your followers. With the mods, you can marry just about anyone in the game, adopt up to 6 kids and have full control of up to 32 followers. There are mods that to me ruin the game like a ring that lets you carry 10,000 pounds of equipment and weapons that do thousands of points of damage. I'm using the mods to add replayability. You can skip over roughly 50% of the quests in this game and still get all the achievements so you can then finish those other 50% quests with a modded character with all the added things you believed should have been in the game. The unofficial patch has fixed two quests that were bugged. I also like the mod that changes how the females look since most are very rough looking, you can pretty things up. The follower mod is good for many laughs. I had two followers with me while fighting a dragon and commanded both to dance in place. So, while I'm pounding away on the dragon, in the background, are my two followers dancing around like nobody is watching. I also use the immersive dialogue mod to make everyone more interesting and maybe more importantly, so everyone doesn't repeat the same line every time you see them. It knows your relationship to the other character and responds accordingly. No more running into your home and hearing your housecarl say, ""Hello, friend, I hope you're not here to cause trouble."" You'll now hear various sayings from, ""I've missed you!"" to ""How was the hunting?"" There are a few other mods that I like a lot like the one that adds more weapon types, those include composite axes (axe with a spear/sword), scoped bows, a knuckle-type dagger, the missing longswords, it's stuff like this that I love seeing in mods. My favorite mods are the ones that add extremely difficult ""boss"" type characters with unique armor and weapons. Most of these have their own locations and they don't really alter the game very much. You just fast travel to their keep or whatever location they're at and fight them. These are so much harder than anything in the Skyrim game. I fought one named Gotha who had great armor and mask with massive horns coming out. I used 16 health potions and probably 15 minutes, running around, jumping, dodging, timing my every attack just to kill this one character. It adds a bit of a Dark Souls feel with these bosses and I think that's one of the real weaknesses of Skyrim. Once you have the Dragon weapons, have them improved/tempered, you become nearly invincible but these Boss character mods add a whole new dimension. I do use the improved blood and extra execution moves mod as well. It adds a lot of realism to those snowy fights where you hit someone 20 times with a sword only to see a little blood. With the mod, there is blood everywhere on the snow. Last, I do use a few of the home mods like Waterview and Windyridge. These add homes in areas where there are no other options and Waterview has many areas to plant your alchemy ingredients plus custom stands to put your different weapons and masks on. It's located on the other side of the mountain beside of Whiterun and Riverwood. Windyridge is up in Winterhold.

The Elder Scrolls, specifically Skyrim, will most likely be my all-time favorite game. Another series has every chance to pass it and that's Fallout but so far I still prefer Skyrim to Bethesda's other masterpiece. This Special Edition, if paced and used with mods that add difficulty, is the best version. I do play it some on the PC but prefer the XB1 version just because it feels like my favorite console game was majorly improved.",believ version skyrim skyrim se xb1 pc skyrim legendari ps3 xbox 360 skyrim vanilla xbox 360 pc total 2000 hour variou version think ill take differ angl review sinc se bring new featur xb1 version come dlc worth mention cannot remov dlc like could legendari edit simpli mean vampir random attack parti start show level 8 legendari could choos instal dawnguard want deal vampir threat favorit merchant npc also come fulli new achiev mean achiev skyrim legendari vanilla get use mod disabl achiev bethesda creation club offer paid mod disabl achiev believ controversi move havent crash problem creation club mod regular free mod mod big new featur sinc want achiev play nonmod charact roughli 100 hour level 55 powerlevel start get bore decid tri mod charact start instead load 89 mod continu last game import start new set save mean time switch back play unmod,1519603200,5

The aerial combat was good, brief; and the only authentic Great War battlefield portrayed in the entire game, was below you, in low detail, not interactable.

54429,6855,419,"At first you needed it to play co-op on Wii u and Switch but since more recent updates you no longer need the amiibo for co-op. The main appeal of this amiibo is so you can play as a ""custom knight"". The difference being that instead of collecting treasure and using it to buy upgrades in the game, collecting treasure as a custom knight is like gaining experience points and after gaining a certain amount you level up and gain a relic or something for shovel knight and another color pallet choice. There are some extra relics that can only be obtained as a custom knight. Max level is 50 so you won't get to max level until near the end of the game. Also there is a person in town that will give you the option to summon a shovel fairy if you scan the amiibo. It doesn't effect the gameplay but it flies around and does silly or adorable things.

Also an important note is that if you are playing co-op and both players want to play as a custom knight you will need 2 shovel knight amiibos, one for each player. However, you can still play with one player as a custom knight and one not being a custom knight if you only have one amiibo.

I would have given it 5 stars if it was a necessity for co-op but since it is no longer that way I'd say it gets 4 stars.

54481,2872,2970,"DQ 8 is a game of firsts. First game of the series on PS2. First game to use the patented Akira Torimaya art style in full resolution in one of the games. The first to completely drop the ""Dragon Warrior"" name for the true series' name: Dragon Quest. And its the first of an alliance between Enix & its bitter rival Square. There is even a PS2 demo disc of Final Fantasy XII in the package.

Enix had made the previous entry in the series on PSone late in it life cycle (Dragon Warrior VII) and that had been a jab at Square because the first FF game early on in the PSone was the first to be released there was FFVII.

Many people like to say Square abandoned Nintendo because of the N64 and while that is true for the main home console market, Enix & Square separately made a reputation for themselves by doing Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance titles which were remakes of the console releases. So pixel DW & FF games reigned on. Sadly there was no DQ game on N64 or Game Cube.

Square was the more popular company but was bleeding cash because of the lack luster of its two massive CGI theatrical releases ""The Spirits Within"" and ""Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children"" so the two partnered up.

So what does this all culminate in? Something special. Having laid aside the history lesson, DQ VIII is a fun, beautiful game to play back then and now. Each character is amusing to listen to with full vocal conversations. Consider the 3DS remake as well.",dq 8 game first first game seri ps2 first game use patent akira torimaya art style full resolut one game first complet drop dragon warrior name true seri name dragon quest first allianc enix bitter rival squar even ps2 demo disc final fantasi xii packag enix made previou entri seri psone late life cycl dragon warrior vii jab squar first ff game earli psone first releas ffvii mani peopl like say squar abandon nintendo n64 true main home consol market enix squar separ made reput game boy color game boy advanc titl remak consol releas pixel dw ff game reign sadli dq game n64 game cube squar popular compani bleed cash lack luster two massiv cgi theatric releas spirit within final fantasi vii advent child two partner culmin someth special laid asid histori lesson dq viii fun beauti game play back charact amus listen full vocal convers consid 3d remak well,1519689600,4

54560,5101,2719,"Edit (8/15/18): When VersionTech noticed my low rating they got in contact with me and offered help. Their customer service reps are great, and very friendly. Anyways, they sent me a replacement for them and the second pair seems to be working fine so far (I've had these for 2-3 months now), so I bumped the rating from 1 to 4 stars.

I enjoyed playing games on my PS4 with this headset for a few weeks. After about a month, my PS4 started lagging really bad, and the sound kept skipping. I rebooted the console, but the issue persisted. I just quit and went to bed. The next day I tried again, it worked fine for a bit, and then again, the lag that made my games impossible to play. For whatever reason I disconnected the headset, probably pissed that I couldn't play and my PS4 was dying or something. To my surprise, it started working fine again... tried a different pair of headphones I had, no issues. Tried these again, laggy, skipping sound. Now, I don't know what is going on, all I know is that my PS4 (original model) doesn't like these at all for some reason. That's all I needed them for, and since they've just sitting there for the past 3 months, they're useless to me now, hence the 1-star rating.

While they worked, they did a pretty good job, and I probably would've given these 4 stars. I don't recommend this to PS4 owners at all, especially if you own the original model. I can't speak for the Slim model or the Pro.",edit 81518 versiontech notic low rate got contact offer help custom servic rep great friendli anyway sent replac second pair seem work fine far ive 23 month bump rate 1 4 star enjoy play game ps4 headset week month ps4 start lag realli bad sound kept skip reboot consol issu persist quit went bed next day tri work fine bit lag made game imposs play whatev reason disconnect headset probabl piss couldnt play ps4 die someth surpris start work fine tri differ pair headphon issu tri laggi skip sound dont know go know ps4 origin model doesnt like reason that need sinc theyv sit past 3 month theyr useless henc 1star rate work pretti good job probabl wouldv given 4 star dont recommend ps4 owner especi origin model cant speak slim model pro,1519862400,4

Seriously, as good as this game was it isn't worth $40. No game that old is worth $40 unless it at least comes with all DLCs. Please stop price gouging old games! It isn't right. There should at least be some control over price gouging video games on Amazon. The used copy I got came in great shape just had a sticker on the case (nothihg a razor blade & a little lighter fluid couldn't handle) also the box wasn't closed all the way on arrival but the disk was in perfect shape & works well.

Even after all these years this game is still pretty enjoyable & story is pretty well written almost seems like movie material. Graphics are pretty advanced for the time this game came out & driving seems pretty realistic. Only thing I wish this game had was more free roam after campaign. Also there seems to be no way to get the DLCs on PSN. Used to have the game on Xbox 360 which included DLCs but decided to get it on PS3 this time around.

Theres at least 5 DLCs from what I can remember that my Xbox copy came with; Vegas pack Hero pack Jimmys Vendetta, & Joes Adventures.

The design is great, the lighting is amazing and most importantly I easily got used to the switches.  I can type very quickly on this keyboard, and I love the feel of the keycaps as well as the switches.  I did a few gaming session with it and it worked well in that capacity too.

There are only a few things keeping me from going full five star on this:

(1) The keycaps do not let you see the ighting below the secondary functions of every key.  Meaning that "" 4 "" is lit up, but "" $ "" is not.  It's a minor nitpick, and can be fixed with different keycaps however it is annoying.
(2) the Chroma software requires you to create a Razer account to use it.  Why????  This is severely stupid.
(3) Again with the software, it is exteremely customizable, however the learning curve is also quite high.  I still cannot figure out how to make the lighting breathe AND ripple at the same time.  I know it is possible but I cannot be bothered to go through all the nonsense to get it working.

It's easier to pull off an amazing stunt in real life than what it is in Supercross Encore. There's Alot of once great gaming series/franchises that have been completely ruined for me over the years.

The adjustable head piece is plastic and round and is supposed to wrap around the upper/back part of your head, not straight over the front/top (note the round shape). I moved it around for a while to find the perfect position and then forgot I had it on while playing Minecraft with my kids for 4 hours.

This is for right hand users only so don't buy it if you are a lefty.

Kind of heavy. This is not a lightweight mouse like the BenQ Zowie. More like the weight of a Razer Naga Hex V2. I'm surprised because I would figure it would be more lighter. Boy I was wrong. I suppose this is because of the weight of the rubber grips on the left, right, and underneath the mouse where the weights go as well as a magnet to keeps the bottom cover intact (no, this assessment didn't include the weights).

Being someone who likes very light mice to lift and prevent hand fatigue, the tuning weights don't do much for me. You can place up to 5 weights inside the bottom of the mouse to ""tune"". They can be arranged in different locations. One caveat is that they cause the mouse to create more friction to the mouse mat. If you got a fiber cloth mouse pad, it'll probably wear more using these weights.

It feels kind of cheap. I say this because if I lift the mouse and drop it on the mat, it has a plastic hollow kind of sound. Tapping on the plastic surface has a higher ""tinny"" kind of sound compared to my other gaming mice.

Placement of the buttons are good. The one button that I don't care much for is the one near the thumb grip. It is located just a tad too far away from my thumb which causes me to shift my hand towards it. Losing that grip is not good for fast paced FPS games as you have to reset your palm. As a result, I claw more than palm with this mouse.

The scroll wheel is very good. I like the ""infinite scroll"" where it just spins forever. There is also a button on top that forces it into grooved steps.

Software wise, you use the Logitech Gaming Framework. Setting up is pretty much straightforward. You assign mouse functions, keystrokes, and multi key macros (keys only, no mouse operations). The UI is hard to read though because of the black mouse image. They should have just created two images - Top View and Left Side View to avoid the clutter and make the buttons easier to recognize.

The curvature of the thumb area is very good and the grips on the left and right sides are excellent. However, I'll leave it to time to determine if those grips start to lose their stickiness and erode. The rubber is pretty hard so I expect the inlay pattern to not wear fast.",45 star right hand user dont buy lefti kind heavi lightweight mous like benq zowi like weight razer naga hex v2 im surpris would figur would lighter boy wrong suppos weight rubber grip left right underneath mous weight go well magnet keep bottom cover intact ass didnt includ weight someon like light mouse lift prevent hand fatigu tune weight dont much place 5 weight insid bottom mous tune arrang differ locat one caveat caus mous creat friction mous mat got fiber cloth mous pad itll probabl wear use weight feel kind cheap say lift mous drop mat plastic hollow kind sound tap plastic surfac higher tinni kind sound compar game mouse placement button good one button dont care much one near thumb grip locat tad far away thumb caus shift hand toward lose grip good fast pace fp game reset palm result claw palm mous scroll wheel good like infinit,1520380800,4

54875,8738,461,"Everything about Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is improved upon from its direct predecessor Donkey Kong Country Returns. We experience the realm of DK for the first time in High-Definition. The graphics and worlds are so much more lush and there is so much to explore and unlock in each level. Retro Studios couldn't go wrong by bringing back David Wise, the composer from the original DKC series in the mid 1990's, and it really shows with how immersive and memorable the music is. The worlds and enemies are distinct from each other and this has always been a strongpoint of the DKC series when compared to other platformers.

I'm enthralled by the return of Dixie Kong this time around and I hope she is here to stay. Cranky Kong is also a playable character but I try to avoid using him as I find his abilities harder to control than Diddy Kong's jet-pack or Dixie's hovering ponytail. As for the animal buddies, we are still left with just Rambi The Rhino and some background appearances from Squawks The Parrot. I sorely miss using Enguarde The Swordfish during the underwater levels among some of the other animals which had extremely useful abilities to help you soar through levels.

Retro Studios did away with the hoard of Tiki characters from DKC Returns and instead replaced them with Nordic Animal Vikings threatening to freeze DK Isle for good. While I like the Viking enemies much better than the Tiki characters that were used before, many of us DKC veterans are still left longing for the return of the rightful villains to the DKC universe, King K. Rool and the Kremlings. Are they really owned by Rare? Is this the reason for their unexplained absence 2 times in a row?

My only other complaint, and this is a massive one, is the extreme difficulty of the game following the same issue with DKC Returns. Now, you're hearing from someone who completed all 3 DKC games from the original series on the SNES and the GBA versions respectively. Even the Donkey Kong Land series on the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color version of the original. Yet something in the translation from straightforward 2D to 2.5D has made these games nearly impossible to master in the later stages of the game. Same thing with DKC Returns, except they gave us Super Donkey Kong to complete the levels for us if we were unable to do so ourselves after multiple attempts. Such feature is absent this time around and there was really no reason to remove it because of how hard this game becomes. Even in the early stages, you can sense how hard this game is going to get later on. It's not even funny, I was stuck on the 5th World for over a year with this game. I'm not removing any stars for this, but simply pleading with Retro Studios to make the game more accessible for beginner to intermediate players in the next sequel.

Now in 2018, with the upcoming port of this game coming out the Nintendo Switch, perhaps the inclusion of Funky Kong as a playable character will make this game easier to master. I can only hope. This was an incredibly hard game where I didn't exactly feel like I accomplished anything significant once I beat it, just sheer exhaustion. Still, this is an awesome game and memorable addition to the longtime series.",everyth donkey kong countri tropic freez improv upon direct predecessor donkey kong countri return experi realm dk first time highdefinit graphic world much lush much explor unlock level retro studio couldnt go wrong bring back david wise compos origin dkc seri mid 1990 realli show immers memor music world enemi distinct alway strongpoint dkc seri compar platform im enthral return dixi kong time around hope stay cranki kong also playabl charact tri avoid use find abil harder control diddi kong jetpack dixi hover ponytail anim buddi still left rambi rhino background appear squawk parrot sore miss use enguard swordfish underwat level among anim extrem use abil help soar level retro studio away hoard tiki charact dkc return instead replac nordic anim vike threaten freez dk isl good like vike enemi much better tiki charact use mani u dkc veteran still left long return right villain dkc univers king k rool kreml realli own rare reason unexplain absenc 2 time row,1520467200,5

54889,5101,961,"After reviewing several different Vita cases, I ended up deciding on this because it seemed like the best option in its price range. I purchased it a little bit before I ordered my Vita because I wanted to make sure I had a way to keep it safe as soon as I took it out of the box. And I was glad I did.
This case will fit the Vita 2000 model perfectly (I don't have a hard shell on mine, only a screen protector). It will also fit up to three game cards on the inner flap. About that, I don't recommend sticking the cards too far in the little pockets, because it may be hard to get them back out, especially if you don't have skinny fingers. Other than that, I never needed more than three cards while I'm on the go, so it's not a big deal to me.
Now, the case is most importantly designed to keep the Vita safe from falls, rough handling, and other forms of impact. It does that flawlessly. The anti shock ""bubbles"" will keep your Vita safe from almost anything.
I've read many reviews from people saying you can't fit the charging cables and adapter in this case... I don't understand how they can't. All you have to do is insert the adapter in the pocket first, all the way in. Then bend the cables like an accordion and stick them in the pocket, plug ends first. And voila. Now your Vita is still totally safe from impact, and you can also carry your charger around with it. In fact, keeping your cables/adapter in the pocket helps make the case sturdier when it's zipped up: less room for the Vita to bounce around during transportation.
All in all, there may be ""better"" cases out there, depending on what better means. This one is currently very cheap (7.99), and it does its job perfectly. I've had mine for almost two years now, both the case and the Vita are still intact. Unless you need to carry more games around for some reason, I 100% recommend this to any Slim Vita owners (can't speak for the 1000 model as I don't have one).",review sever differ vita case end decid seem like best option price rang purchas littl bit order vita want make sure way keep safe soon took box glad case fit vita 2000 model perfectli dont hard shell mine screen protector also fit three game card inner flap dont recommend stick card far littl pocket may hard get back especi dont skinni finger never need three card im go big deal case importantli design keep vita safe fall rough handl form impact flawlessli anti shock bubbl keep vita safe almost anyth ive read mani review peopl say cant fit charg cabl adapt case dont understand cant insert adapt pocket first way bend cabl like accordion stick pocket plug end first voila vita still total safe impact also carri charger around fact keep cablesadapt pocket help make case sturdier zip le room vita bounc around transport may,1520467200,5

54898,5101,606,"I have been playing video games for a while now. I used to play the original Pitfall on my dad's work computer back in 1991 or so. Then we got Nintendo's Famicom (sort of the same thing as the NES), then I had a Sega Genesis, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4. I had not played Nintendo games in a long time, and I was craving some of the first-party franchises Nintendo owns exclusively. The good old ones, such as Mario, Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Sar Fox, etc.
While I love my PS4, there's a uniqueness about Nintendo's franchises that simply can't be found anywhere else. There's some really good PlayStation exclusive games out there, pretty sure XBox1 users will also have some exclusives they love. But when it comes to exclusive IP, Nintendo takes the crown. These are franchises my generation has been playing since we were born.
I missed out on the Wii, but the cool thing about the Wii U is that not only it has GREAT games available on it (anything Mario, Mario Kart, Zelda, or any of the others I mentioned above, plus a bunch more), you can also play your old Wii games on it, so that instantly makes the library endless. So yeah, I've been buying Wii games as well... just a decade late, that's all.
If you like or want to play games with family and friends, Nintendo's systems are typically designed to do just that. Again, PS4 and XB1, both great systems, but they don't compare when it comes to local multiplayer, again Nintendo takes the crown. Mario Kart, Smash Bros., Nintendoland, Mario Wii U, Mario 3D, Donkey Kong, Yoshi, and more, are great, fun games for kids and adults alike. They make great party games, and are easier to set up than board games.
The system comes with a gamepad that resembles a portable console or tablet. This is what you will be using for all the menus, and for most games. Some games make special use of this pad, such as Nintendoland, which sometimes will give the gamepad holder a special task that sets that person apart from the rest of the group.
Now, not all is fun and games (literally it is, but I'm just speaking metaphorically here) with the Wii U. The system did not sell well, and fell very very short of the expectations Nintendo had for it. The company made a few key mistakes with this system: the main one being the time of release. Depending on how you look at it, the Wii U was either released too early or too late. Too late to compete with the PS3/XB360. Too early to compete with the PS4/XB1, which were released a year later, with far more powerful computers in them and full support from 3rd party developers. This threw off both consumers and developers, because the PS3 and XB360 were already established as the top contenders, with huge libraries of games. And from a 3rd party developer perspective, the system was in between generations, it was too much work to make next gen games and try to port them over to the Wii U hardware, and most importantly, not profitable enough to justify it.
One issue you may have is there are many accessories available for the system. There are tons of knock-off brands out there, but the quality is sub par. If there is one thing Nintendo is known for, is quality products. If you can afford it, I recommend getting officially licensed Nintendo products (controllers and such).

In conclusion, the poor sales record doesn't mean that the Wii U is not a great system. It is one of the best and most fun consoles I've ever owned. It's like a Wii on steroids. I bought mine two years ago and never regretted it.

54943,7281,3140,"To be fair, this game is rather old now, but the in-game graphics are actually still pretty spot on, it's a fun game to play, and was revolutionary for its time.  This game inspired more thought towards the Assassins Creed games, and the producers of the game never thought it would be such a hit.  However, after the game was played widely and recommended from people who played it to people who did not, they produced more of the Prince of Persia games.

That being said, this is obviously the first of the series, but not the first Prince of Persia game.  There were ones that predated it, but aren't worth your spit so don't bother.  And they're ancient.  However, that is where the death machines come from as it seems highly unlikely that this castle had rotating buzz saws and spiked, spinning columns back in the days of Persian times.

The characters are actually pretty enjoyable.  The Prince is an arrogant snot-rag at first, but eventually his snooty, pretentious outlook turns to base sarcasm and then genuine appreciation for the world and people in it, so hey...redemption.  His female counterpart-love interest, Farah, is also pretty genuine as she typically talks like an actual person and has a use other than being the ""damsel in distress.""  Both play off of each other well, and once they team up, it's fun to see her helping the Prince.

The gameplay is forgiving, thankfully because of the ability to reverse time, so if the Prince falls an irrevocable death, you can always reverse time and send him careening back up to the ledge he jumped from, safe and sound.  And this is super helpful as the majority of the game is puzzle based, attempting to get the Prince to navigate the gigantic palace safely.  Only a small amount of the game is actual fighting, and it's pretty repetitive and even gets to be annoying after a certain point.

The story is simple, but intriguing.  The Prince must save the world from the sands that have been released from an hourglass by an evil Vizier (I call him Jafar because he looks just like him) who is part of the official governmental party of Farah's homeland.  The Prince and her are the only two survivors, other than the Vizier, and they must find the hourglass, return the dagger that started the whole problem to it, and hopefully save the world from being consumed by sand.  All the palace workers, guards, creatures, and royalty have been turned into mindless sand beasts keen on killing the Prince and Farah.  So, they team up to kick some serious sand.

The ending, for lack of a better term, is pretty lackluster, but again, the developers never intended for it to be such a hit.  But with it'\s revolutionary gameplay where the Prince can run up walls, do backflips over sand beasts, and turn back time, the game had a lot going for it.",fair game rather old ingam graphic actual still pretti spot fun game play revolutionari time game inspir thought toward assassin creed game produc game never thought would hit howev game play wide recommend peopl play peopl produc princ persia game said obvious first seri first princ persia game one predat arent worth spit dont bother theyr ancient howev death machin come seem highli unlik castl rotat buzz saw spike spin column back day persian time charact actual pretti enjoy princ arrog snotrag first eventu snooti pretenti outlook turn base sarcasm genuin appreci world peopl heyredempt femal counterpartlov interest farah also pretti genuin typic talk like actual person use damsel distress play well team fun see help princ gameplay forgiv thank abil revers time princ fall irrevoc death alway revers time send careen back ledg jump safe sound super help major game puzzl base attempt get princ navig gigant palac,1520553600,4

Still it retains a lot of classic ff elements, such as, active time battles, magic casting and a deep magical story. The graphics are some of the best most realistic ones on playstation. The characters are clean and real looking.

The prerenderd backgrounds shine with artistic flare and poetic fantasy. The soundtrack reflects the tragic story perfectly with orchestra from nobuo umetsu. Some of the most soul chilling memorial youthful sounds to me are in this game. You are a teenager with fears of letting other in. soon you become a fighter for the garden school you are in. it becomes a huge adventure of true birth, time travel and memories. It symbolizes rebirth and that memories is time that is from you inside. the battle system is the junction system. You equip magic to stats that change them. What is alike the magic, reflects in its effect. A cure spell gives you the best hp boost, etc.

you can draw magic from enemies. Your gf's aka summons, are a huge part of this game and your power.

As others have said, this game in some respects reminds me of Bioshock and other games like that.  It has a good creepy atmosphere with some really nicely done graphics and level designs with the exception of the black blob enemies.  This is a bit less of an all-out action shooter and blends some elements of using the environment and stuff around you to progress through the game (which reminded me a bit of the Dishonored games).  It can be frustrating at times trying to progress due to the lack of clear direction of what you need to do though as well as the limited supplies can be a bit frustrating.  A but too many, notes, books and the like to read, which tend to slow things down a bit too much. Load times are a bit long and slow.  I am not sure at this point in the game that I am, that I like this better than the Bioshock or the Dishonored series, but I do find it fun and entertaining, especially the holiday sale price I got it for.

55072,3773,703,"The original Blackwidow Chroma is a not so great keyboard. I got this as a Christmas present in 2016 and it lasted until around May 2017.

When the keyboard DID work, it worked pretty well. The lighting was good, the software was buggy as hell, and the switches felt good enough.

Okay, so going over the design it looks just like your average 2014 Blackwidow until you plug it in. One design change in the Chroma is the WHITE backplate instead of a green one, and that's so all the colors pop. You have 5 additional macro keys which are very nice to have, as well as a USB pass through and input jacks for a 3.5 MM mic and headphones. Nice job on thinking outside the box Razer. HOWEVER, this keyboard is made of a plastic that is a GREASE MAGNET. When I took it out of the box, it already had at least 5 finger prints on it from me picking it up. Overall, the design gets a B-.

The key switches. This keyboard uses the FIRST GENERATION Razer Green switches, made by a switch manufacturer named ""Kailh"" and these switches were not that great, and we can't be surprised by that because all other Kailh switches are crap. The Blackwidow Ultimate 2014 and the Blackwidow Chroma (And Chroma TE) had issues with some keys not being as clicky as others, as well as registering twice on one key stroke. Personally, I never had these issues BUT they felt VERY MUSHY.

HOWEVER, despite feeling mushy, they were very responsive and were actually a bit quieter, due to the mush. But still, a mechanical keyboard isn't suppose to be feel mushy. Luckily, Razer ditched Kailh and switched to Greetech in spring of 2016, Greetech switches have MUCH higher quality and feel a lot better. No mush to them at all. This keyboard here did get updated with the Greetech switch, but its pretty rare to find one. Overall, the switches get a D-.

What about the software? This keyboard runs on Synapse 2.0, I'm not sure if it will be updated to support Synapse 3.0 or not, but I highly doubt it. At the time when I had this keyboard (Late 2016 - Early 2017) Synapse was very buggy. Sometimes lighting effects wouldn't change or work right, it crashed a lot, it was a nightmare. Luckily a few updates in Summer of 2017 fixed all my issues, made my Deathadder perform a bit better too. Software gets a C.

Now for the icing on the cake, the lighting. The lighting is very nice. This keyboard features a white backplate while the Blackwidow Ultimate 2014 features a green backplate. The Chroma model has a white backplate to allow ALL the colors to look vibrant. If they would have used a green backplate, all the colors but green would look ""off."" The lighting is controlled through Razer Synapse, which allows for a few preset lighting effects, or you can create your own. Lighting gets an A+.

Would I recommend this keyboard? Honestly, no. If you want a Razer Chroma keyboard, get the Blackwidow X Chroma or the Blackwidow Chroma V2. You get upgraded LED's, as well as the new Greetech switches.",origin blackwidow chroma great keyboard got christma present 2016 last around may 2017 keyboard work work pretti well light good softwar buggi hell switch felt good enough okay go design look like averag 2014 blackwidow plug one design chang chroma white backplat instead green one that color pop 5 addit macro key nice well usb pas input jack 35 mm mic headphon nice job think outsid box razer howev keyboard made plastic greas magnet took box alreadi least 5 finger print pick overal design get b key switch keyboard use first gener razer green switch made switch manufactur name kailh switch great cant surpris kailh switch crap blackwidow ultim 2014 blackwidow chroma chroma te issu key clicki other well regist twice one key stroke person never issu felt mushi howev despit feel mushi respons actual bit quieter due mush still mechan keyboard isnt suppos feel mushi luckili razer ditch kailh switch greetech spring 2016 greetech switch much higher qualiti,1520812800,2

Even the later games, while sort of blah, had their own little tweaks and quirks that kept the feeling fresh and vibrant. Which is what makes this so disappointing. Everything, from mechanics and plot down to the jokes are just lifted from a game more than 10 years old, and merged with a second villain.

Pros:
Gorgeous scenery
Colorful and fun characters
Some good jokes, even with the blatant wink-wink some of them have
movie tie-in handled well without being annoying

Cons:
Zero new things
Great mechanics and villains removed
Zero new jokes

55085,831,4372,"Persona 5 is the most stylish and artistic JRPG game I've ever played. Within the first hour, you can sense the love that the devs put into this game. The sheer amount of polish in animations and art style are a non-stop visual treat. The funky jazzy pop-rock music compliments the game's style at every turn. Culturally, Persona 5 immerses you in the every day Japanese lifestyle of a teenager. Many of the cities and locations you visit are near snap-shots of the real thing.

Weighing in at around 90 hours, Persona 5 is no pushover when it comes to content. 80 percent of Persona 5 is fully voice-acted by a talented English cast that breathes life into the characters while not sounding unrealistic or awkward - often an issue in anime dubs. The fighting elements are insanely enjoyable and will feel familiar to any turn-based JRPG fan. Also, there's a Pokemon capturing aspect to it as well - if that's your thing.

The shining star of the game is the life-like connections you feel towards the many characters you meet throughout your journey. You grow immensely throughout your journey, right alongside many friends who you can choose to either ignore or strengthen bonds with. Going to the movies, studying for a test, eating some sushi, or sightseeing are everyday activities in Persona.

Be ready for tons of story elements that, while feeling cumbersome at times, are well worth the patience. If you persist through to the end you'll realize that those slow moments all add up to fulfilling experiences, which affects the entire way you feel towards certain characters. These all ultimately result in greater satisfaction in the game's finale. I've never played a game where digital pixels transcend reality and feel like life-like friends.

55184,7355,4026,"I bought this to convert my PS4 fightstick so I wouldn't have to buy one just for an Xbox One.  First thing I did was update the firmware of the stick. So far I tested the adapter with the following:

1. Dualshock 4
2. Hori RAP 4 KAI (both PS4 & PS3)
3. Mad Catz MIDI Pro Adapter for PS3 (all three modes)

I have not been disappointed by its functionality. The amount of lag produced is so minimal that it's hardly noticeable. My only caveat is that you need to update the converter's firmware, but it's necessary in a world where either Sony or Microsoft can transform any device into a brick just by releasing their own update. And this has happened just recently for the PS4 variants of this converter when firmware 5.50 came out.

Another thing I would like to point out is that since the stick is recognized as a Xbox One controller, you can use this on PC as an easy way to play games that require Xinput. The converter is wireless capable, so after pairing feel free to ditch the cable.

NOTE: While the number of controllers grows as time passes, not every single controller is supported. Check with the manufacturers webpage to find out what is and what isn't compatible.

55267,4032,3769,"New Bordeaux, 1968. Lincoln Clay returns from Vietnam and, reluctantly, starts helping out his family and the criminal life he thought he'd left behind. A bank raid, pulled off with the help of the local mob, goes south and Clay is betrayed and left for dead. Surviving, he sets out to destroy the mafia family running the city and take everything over for himself.

Back in 2002, Illusion Softworks released Mafia (aka The City of Lost Heaven), one of the greatest video games of all time. Mafia had an incredible narrative focus and memorable characters, not to mention jaw-dropping graphics for the time. The game's story - of the rise, fall and escape of taxi cab driver turned mafia hitman turned state's witness Tommy Angelo - didn't break new ground, but the dialogue and voice acting certainly did. The gameplay was also quite good. Mafia achieved its feats through a strong narrative focus: the city was a backdrop with you moving directly from mission to mission. Despite some surface superficial similarities, the game was very much not Grand Theft Auto: 1930, and was all the better for it.

By the time Mafia II rolled around, Illusion Softworks had been taken over by Take 2 Interactive, the publishers of the Grand Theft Auto series, and it's clear that they wanted the team to make the game more like the GTA series, with lots of optional content, side missions and filler activities. Remarkably, the developers held their ground and, whilst Mafia II certainly had some more optional activities, it still wasn't a true open world game. Unfortunately, the game's story and characters were thin compared to the original game and it was much shorter, resulting in a less satisfying game overall (although still perfectly decent to play).

Mafia III, sadly, hoists the surrender flag on the series trying to do its own thing and not be a GTA clone. A new developer, Hanger 13, handles production duties on the game (helped by a few veterans of the first two titles) and it's clear they were told to make an all-out GTA clone...but bizarrely without anything approaching an appropriate budget. The result is a game that is extraordinarily frustrating, giving rise to some excellent gaming moments but then throwing it away with repetitive missions and a startling array of technical errors and crashes.

The game's opening is a near-unmitigated disaster. The opening few hours of the game introduce protagonist Lincoln Clay and depict him carrying out a bank raid which goes horribly wrong and leaves him betrayed and left for dead. Rather than simply tell this story, the game jumps backwards and forwards in time several times for no discernible reason, drops a ton of cut scenes into the mix and also brings in a framing device of a TV documentary in contemporary times looking back at these events. As a storytelling device this is perfectly fine (and gets a lot better later on), but the way it's presented at the start of the game is totally incoherent.

The game doesn't really get going until the city opens up and you're presented with the open world environment. This section of the game is the most interesting, but unfortunately is also the most repetitive. During Lincoln's adventures he allies with three criminals who agree to work with him to bring down the city's mafia family. As he drives the mafia out of each city district, overthrowing their crime bosses and taking over their rackets, he has to choose which ally to assign the district to. Make the wrong choice and your allies will start getting annoyed and will eventually turn on you. However, the game makes it pretty easy to avoid this: there are nine districts, so just give each ally three districts each and they'll be kept sweet forever (simply having a different number of districts that made it impossible to keep everyone sweet may have made the game more interesting).

The act of taking over each district is repetitive in the extreme: a local contact gives you intelligence on the bad guys. Once you've caused enough damage, the crime boss arrives to investigate. Then you kill them. You have to do this twice for each district (to flesh out the capo), so by the end of the game you've done this exact same activity eighteen times (twenty-seven if you count the final ""boss fight"" against the capo). It starts getting boring somewhere around the fifth.

Fortunately, the game breaks up the territory-control stuff with character-based side missions where you keep your allies on-side by helping them solve their own problems, and helping their lieutenants with activities such as gun-running and stealing trucks full of cannabis. There's also collectables to find (such as records and magazines), although not as many as in other games which means you might be tempted to actually do them, and activities such as street-racing which are actually quite good fun. The game also gives you a lot to do with your money, from customising vehicles to upgrading weapons.

The game also can't be flawed for its voice acting and a lot of its writing, which is very good when the story is actually allowed to move forwards. Set in 1968 and featuring a black protagonist, the game throws itself head-on into an exploration of racism and the civil rights movement, which makes for a sometimes ugly game but also a refreshingly honest one. The characters - particularly Clay and his criminal allies, plus his slightly-comical (but also psychotic) CIA friend Donovan - are really well-drawn. If Mafia III was allowed to focus in on the story, like the first two games, and drop the repetitive open-world stuff it would have been much stronger for it. The open world stuff also damages the game's attempts to be a period piece, by giving you a Satnav (not commonly found in cars in 1968) and a mobile phone (ostensibly a walkie-talkie, but it basically stands in for the mobile phone from the GTA games in most respects).

The game is all over the place in other areas. This is a game that came out three years after Grand Theft Auto V but looks like it came out three years earlier. Play this and Mafia II back-to-back and you would not be able to claim with a straight face that six years of video game development took place between them. Particularly awkward are character models: the main characters look really good but everyone else is awful. The environmental graphics are pretty decent, though, and the cars look really nice. The car handling is also pleasingly unrealistic. You can throw these cars around a lot more than the more ""realistic"" direction that GTA series has gone in and they're fun to drive throughout. On the audio side of things, the game has an excellent 1960s soundtrack, although the number of songs that the game licensed is surprisingly low. It's not long before the same songs and adverts start looping around again and again.

From a technical standpoint, the game is - eighteen months after release - a bit of a mess. I experienced a dozen crashes to desktop in the 33 hours it took me to finish the game, along with frequent screen tearing and clipping. Mission objectives frequently vanished on me, or sometimes took me to the wrong place, and the AI was utterly incoherent, missing me beating someone up in front of a bunch of cops whilst sending the entire city's police department after me for a tiny traffic violation. Pedestrians are also dumber than a box of frogs, often taking the novel decision to power-dive from the pavement into the middle of the street right in front of me for absolutely no reason.

The result of all of this is a bewilderingly inconsistent game, with fun driving and racing sequences, strong story missions and great music and voice-acting sitting alongside myriad bugs, dodgy AI and repetitive side content. Eventually the game gets into a rhythm where it becomes much more fun, helped by some good combat mechanics and - completely unexpectedly - a really strong stealth component. Sneaking into warehouses, and knocking out goons one-by-one before swooping out to deliver the coup de grace on a boss is extraordinarily satisfying.

Mafia III (***) is a stronger game than Mafia II but not up to the standards of the original. As an open world game it is repetitive and dull, but it comes to life when the story and characters are allowed to breath. The driving, combat and stealth are all pretty decent, and ultimately you can have a lot of fun with the game. But those messy opening hours are a strong hurdle to get over.",new bordeaux 1968 lincoln clay return vietnam reluctantli start help famili crimin life thought hed left behind bank raid pull help local mob goe south clay betray left dead surviv set destroy mafia famili run citi take everyth back 2002 illus softwork releas mafia aka citi lost heaven one greatest video game time mafia incred narr focu memor charact mention jawdrop graphic time game stori rise fall escap taxi cab driver turn mafia hitman turn state wit tommi angelo didnt break new ground dialogu voic act certainli gameplay also quit good mafia achiev feat strong narr focu citi backdrop move directli mission mission despit surfac superfici similar game much grand theft auto 1930 better time mafia ii roll around illus softwork taken take 2 interact publish grand theft auto seri clear want team make game like gta seri lot option content side mission filler activ remark develop held ground whilst mafia ii certainli option activ still wasnt true open world game unfortun game stori charact thin compar origin game much shorter result le satisfi game overal although still perfectli decent play mafia iii sadli hoist surrend flag,1521158400,3

55293,857,188,"There are two games that come with this disc. The first, Metro 2033, shows its age, even with a remaster. This is not a problem, in general, but becomes a point of frustration when you realize that the controls are clunky and are not quite adequate for the type of enemies and combat that are required. Many of the mutant enemies are very fast and trying to fight them with what feels like a bad camera, slow reloads on a gun and virtually no ammo, makes for a frustrating experience.

The story is somewhat interesting and the atmosphere can be intriguing at times. However, I found myself becoming more frustrated as I moved forward in the game. This is not really a run and gun type of game. You have to have a mixture of stealth and gun play. The age of this game makes the levels very repetitive and all the the same. There is no hand holding at all, so you must have the patience to figure out where to go and what to do. Often, you are left scratching your head and wondering it you took a wrong turn.

I ended up quitting the first game and starting the second, Metro Last Light. There was a noticeable improvement in graphics and narration. This game felt more immersive, and the game play is initially fun, with lots of opportunities to be stealth and get in those headshots. Ammo is much more abundant and some people hate that. You spend about the first half of the game dealing with human enemies, which for good or bad, has a little of that COD feel. However, as you progress, they start dumping mutants on you in situations that once again, become frustrating. All of a sudden, you get stuck in areas where your mask filters run out every few seconds and often there are none to be found. You begin to deal with the same mutant in your face frustration and not being able to really reload your gun and deal with them as much. Once you get to the swamp level, the frustration ramps up. I had to start the chapter over due to not having any filters and then having to run through an entire area, rather than explore and enjoy what was an attractive outdoor map. There's some frustrating boss fights and you can find yourself dying from no air filters right when you kill the boss. The developers seem to be trolling the player.

I went from liking this game to just wanting to get done with it. Much of it felt that ""Cheap"" difficulty. Literally, kill 20 mutants, move to next room, wait on elevator, kill 20 more mutants, repeat. These kinds of situations can be fun if combat and supplies are adequate, but that doesn't exist here. I will say that much of the gun mechanics are nicely done, but again, having to reload every few seconds when mutants are smacking you in the face, is just not fun and leads to aggravation.

I would say that if you are a hard core gamer and like a challenge, then you'll probably love this. If you are more casual and don't like frustration, then avoid this. I'm somewhere in between, but for me, when a game is difficult, I want to have a smile on my face, and not to feel as though the developers took the easy way out by spamming enemies at me and taking away resources.",two game come disc first metro 2033 show age even remast problem gener becom point frustrat realiz control clunki quit adequ type enemi combat requir mani mutant enemi fast tri fight feel like bad camera slow reload gun virtual ammo make frustrat experi stori somewhat interest atmospher intrigu time howev found becom frustrat move forward game realli run gun type game mixtur stealth gun play age game make level repetit hand hold must patienc figur go often left scratch head wonder took wrong turn end quit first game start second metro last light notic improv graphic narrat game felt immers game play initi fun lot opportun stealth get headshot ammo much abund peopl hate spend first half game deal human enemi good bad littl cod feel howev progress start dump mutant situat becom frustrat sudden get stuck area,1521244800,3

55311,324,75,"The Basics

121-ish grams WITHOUT optional weights installed. 3366 sensor. 20M omrons. RGB lighting. Went to a Best Buy to pick up the G903. Tried G903, did not like shape. Tried G502, liked. Left store, meditated upon previous dislike for ugly G502 spaceship design. Meditated upon adopting a mouse that seems to weight twice as much as my truck. Bought G502 online next day. Proceeded to enjoy.

Why do a G502 review when the mouse has been around forever? Because it is still a relevant choice on the market, because I like going Nit-Noid on mice, because this mouse deserves the attention it gets, and because pleas need to be made to properly update a winning formula. Testing time prior to review was 19 days.

The Good

  Very good for fingertip, that style feels good even with the heavy weight taken into consideration.

  Good materials. Quality rubber flanks with some nice patterning action going on.

  Excellent 3366 sensor, low LOD. Surface tuning option did seem to make a positive difference.

  Good clicks everywhere. Primary clicks are medium stiffness and manage to have excellent feedback without being terribly loud.

  Excellent thumb buttons, no travel or rattle issues. They are labeled, (nice little touch) and all have light actuation with good tactility. All buttons on the mouse are good, but I do think they would be better with a textured finish as found on the G203.

  Logitech has excellent software. Reliable, intuitive, functional albeit limited in the total number of bells and whistles available compared to a growing portion of the competition.

  The software enables use of the G-Shift option. Basically you can map your mouse to act as a shift key so that virtually all the other buttons on the mouse perform an additional function when pressed with the said shift key.

  Good sniper/extra buttons, I think they are conveniently placed for medium hands and work well. I immediately missed the extra functions when I swapped away from this mouse.

  Infinite scroll is a nice option. I didn't know how much I would use it...until I ended up using it a lot. Another thing easily missed switching away from the mouse

  Apparently durable scroll design. I have no intention of opening this mouse up, part of the reason for that is because there are a number of good teardown videos out there. One thing I learned from a teardown vid is that the regular scroll mode gets its tactility from a plastic arm in contact with the inside of the scroll wheel. That arrangement seems like it would be more durable than what you typically see in most mice.

  A tilt scroll option is not only present, it is easy to use with mercifully light actuation.

  Between the infinite scroll, extra buttons and tilt function, I found the G502 superb for word processing. I had backspace set to one side of the tilt scroll, and the end key mapped to the other. The additional index finger keys were mapped to copy and paste, just for fun. Between the G-Shift and switching profiles on the fly, you can quickly run into more options than you can quickly memorize.

The Middling

  Decent looks in my opinion, but it took a while to get there. If you don't like the looks, all you need to do is think of its functionality, you can stab someone or club them with this mouse. Many uses, such versatile.

The Bad

  Scroll wheel is metal and not rubberized  it feels cold, often a little slick. Rubber should have been an update on the Spectrum model.

  The braided cord is what I would call moderate-stiff, definitely room for improvement.

  Scroll tactility is quite good, but rather clunky. Also, there is enough mass to the scroll wheel that you can overscroll easily in some situations.

  Scroll rattles, sometimes even in game. Not a huge distraction, minor gripe compared to the convenience of having infinite scroll available.

  Heavy weight means a lot more inertia for fast-paced FPS. This is an area where this really good all-rounder isn't so well rounded. The weight means that picking it up is not completely transparent to your mind in-game, even after a week of use. It did go away eventually for me. This mouse is probably unusable for FPS for players who operate below 1000 DPI, even then it is not ideal.

  Okay for small palm and medium fingertip, but larger hands (18.5cm+) that try to palm will probably drag their pinky or feel annoyed trying to keep it off the mousepad.

  There is space for a passable claw grip, but the 502s weight means you have to squeeze that much more with limited thumb surface area. This seems a good recipe for hand fatigue/discomfort over time.

  Scroll toggle button is useful, but would be better as the rearmost of the two buttons behind the scroll. Sure it makes a harder engineering problem, but that is why Logitech employs engineers.

  Rather narrow grip width caused some ring finger fatigue. I always thought of the G502 as a larger mouse, it actually isn't as big as it looks. Making the mouse slightly wider with slight modifications would make it much more comfy and easier to pick up at the same time since more of fingers 4 and 5 would end up in contact with the side of the mouse. The right-side grip surface should flare out slightly more to right with same basic curvature. It would also be good to raise the height of the right side grip section by 2mm to be just slightly more similar to the G403. Forward of the scroll wheel on the right side (where the ring finger goes), the lip section should be flattened slightly to give more options to ring fingers.

  The primary click button was loose in the upward direction. On my copy, if the index finger is not perfectly dry, the mouse button adheres to it and gets pulled upward with the finger and results in a distracting rattle when the two go their separate ways. This was one of the most annoying issues with the mouse. Thankfully it was easily fixed. I put a piece of tape along the front seam of LMB, preventing it from traveling upward out of position.

  Failure to update and missed opportunities. The Proteus core was released some 3 years ago. The Spectrum is still on store shelves some two years after Logitech updated their G logo. Kinda advertises that it is an old mouse. Logitech isn't putting 50m omrons on the mouse. Redundantly...no rubber scroll and no attempt at weight reduction with the Spectrum release. Makes me sad. Worse, the G900 weights 15 grams less and it is wireless. For the Spectrum update, Logitech simply added RGB to the logo and deleted some teal from the thumb rest. If it had been my company doing such a minor change, I would have simply updated the mouse and let people notice the fact there was a nice little production update.

Conclusion

Despite the fact this is an older design, the Proteus Spectrum is still a good design that holds up well in many areas. One of the best compliments I can give the G502 is that Im not terribly tempted to go back to my G403, probably my fave mouse of all time - and that is coming from someone who, until recently, was looking for a 70 gram gaming mouse. Is the 502 ideal for FPS? Nope. But, it is still probably the best all-round mouse Ive used. This mouses honeymoon phase lasted almost two weeks, an eternity for me. Thats part of why I kept using this mouse as long as I did  I didn't want to move on. Its not perfect, and there are several legitimate gripes. This mouses shortcoming are all the more painful because without them this mouse could have been A+ material so easily. That said, I look forward to using it a lot more. I hope we see a G503 come out in a wired and wireless version. The wired version should retain the basic shape with all the buttons and be no more than 100g with adjustable weights, 110g for starters with the wireless version. I can dream.

I was super excited to say the least.  I opened it up slowly & pull it out of its package.  I connected all 4 wires. The one power and the tri-color RWY.  I out an NES Game in and it worked perfect. I was 12 all over again. I played for about 30 minutes. Then I decided to try an SNES Game just checking to make sure everything is working properly.  Super Mario Cart had me hooked for another 30 minutes. Then come to probably my favorite system of the 3, the Genesis.  I pop in NBA jam tournament edition. Just like I remember. It play perfect for like 30 minutes. I stopped turn the system off to go make myself some dinner. I finished eating and I think I want to play some more NBA jam. I come back in the room turn the system on the game comes on it makes it a little music and stuff , I find out my Controller isn't working. So I am plugged it check it out plug it back in, still not working. Its now been seven hours later and the controllers for the Genesis are not working neither port. I know its not the controller because I have a standalone Genesis system that works. So needless to say the Genesis part of the game system at least to control reports are not working. But the other two systems the Nintendo and super Nintendo everything works fine. SI be aware when you buy the system. Im going to send it back to the seller and hopefully theyll send me one that would does work correctly.

Update:  Since I wrote the review the company, at no cost to me sent me another unit. Needless to say Im still having issues. Now It seems that there may be an issue with the game itself. Or maybe the controllers. But both controllers not working. That seems a bit unlikely. Not to say its not the issue. But a bit unlikely. So I popped in my only other two games.  And low and behold the controllers aren't working imo. Those games either. So it seems that the controllers are indeed the issue. So again I applaud the company for their fast action of getting me a new unit. Im giving you guys 5 stars. So if your a person thinking about buying this system. I say spend the money. Its totally worth it. And if you have an issue, let them know and they will do whatever it takes to remedy the problems.

Beginning of Jan I purchased the Rival 310. The mousewheel on my G403 had lost some tactility and the R310 checked virtually all the boxes. 3360 variant sensor, 50m omron switches, RGB and a safe shape. I used it for 6 days before writing this review. My Nit-Noidy thoughts are as follows.

The Good:

  The mouse is very light but manages to feel well made and not hollow.
  The mouse was balanced in the hand regardless of grip type, no ""heavy butt"" problems here.
  The clicks all around feel good. Resistance is significantly more than a G403, but less than a Huano.
  The side buttons are some of the best I've ever used - medium resistance and tactile without appreciable pretravel etc.
  I appreciated that the middle click was one of the easiest to press in, some mice have a middle click so stiff that its utility is virtually eliminated. Some folks have said that the scroll wheel feels cheap, I differ on this point. There is no rattle or wobble and the tactility is excellent with very light resistance - that means it is good for both gaming and browsing.
  One of my favorite aspects of the mouse vs the G403 are the subtle groove ledges flanking the scroll wheel. I tend to keep my fingers close to the scroll wheel and something about that ledge just felt right.
  The plastic texture on the mouse is good, it gives you a feel of the mouse but does not quite evoke a feeling of ""premium"" like some of Corsair's products.
  The sensor is outstanding as you would expect, I just wish it were placed a little farther forward.
  Lift off distance is low.
  The shape is very safe and comfortable, especially for a palm grip. It also works fine for fingertip and claw, but only assuming larger hands.
  Last but not least, the software is EXCELLENT. I'd considered Logitech to be the gold standard here, now I'm thinking Steelseries. The Logitech G software is around 270mb last I checked, is clean, functional and lightweight. The Steelseries software was only a 108mb download and managed to be even more intuitive with more functions than Logitech's offerings for the G403. One thing that the R310 does not have that many Logitech mice have is sensor surface tuning, but I never missed it.

The Middling:

  The cord is the least stiff of any I've tried and kinks were worked out very easily. However, the rubber on the cord is more ""grabby"" than most when it comes into contact with soft mousepads. (Not an issue with a decent bungee.)
  The primary clicks are tactile, but not quite light enough to be considered properly ""MMO spammable"" in my opinion.
  The DPI button is out of the way but a little too far aft of the scroll to be useful for time-critical functions.
  The mouse has everything you need, not much you don't. That said, I'd have liked to see an equivalent ""G-Shift"" option in the software to add more possible macro functions. The mouse isn't as viable to cross over to productivity work like the G502 with all its bells and whistles, but it's still ok.

The Bad:

  The silicone sides have a subtle mush to them, which is kinda meh. They do not feel great despite the nice patterning. They can retain a little bit of heat and do not fare particularly well for grip when/if the going gets moist...I think the choice is adequate for what it is intended for, and it SHOULD be fairly durable, but I'm not 100% sure. I would have much preferred the same textured plastic on the sides as on the top.
  My copy had slight pretravel on the left click with definite differences in click sound and feel between left and right click.
  My copy developed also developed a slight rattle on the aft thumb button after a few days.
  The mouse is very long while being wider and relatively low compared to the G403. If you have average or smaller hands, fingertipping the mouse will lead to either clicking the primary buttons toward the rear of the mouse (meaning stiffer clicks) OR you'll continually have the butt of the mouse bumping into your palm when looking/shooting down in-game.
  Using a claw grip for me meant reducing the thumb surface touching the mouse, making it feel less controllable. My in-game performance was still very good, but the mouse definitely caters to palm and/or large hands. For me, it felt like there was a whole lot of mouse wasted forward of the scroll and aft of the thumb and I ended up clicking about even with the back of the scroll wheel. If the mouse retained its basic shape while being shorter, it would be a more versatile option for more people, but might sacrifice awesomeness factor for big/palm types.

Conclusion:

Despite the questionable choice of silicone, the mouse is fantastic overall and performs as a top-tier option in my opinion. The software is probably the best I've ever seen. It is an easy recommend for any grip style, but with the caveat that your hand ideally be 18.5cm+ in length. It is because of the many good qualities of this mouse that the unsuitably large size makes me sad :(

55414,3773,1466,"The Razer Naga Trinity is the latest release in Razer's Naga lineup. The Naga Trinity brings several new features as well as a much needed sensor upgrade. So, lets get on with the review.

The design has changed a little. The right and left click have grooves in them, similar to the Deathadder, where the Naga 2014, Naga Chroma, Naga Epic Chroma and Naga Hex V2 has a slightly different button design. The scroll wheel also has a different pattern and feels like a Basilisk scroll wheel with the tension high, which actually surprised me. Otherwise, the design is the exact same as previous Nagas.

Feature wise, this is probably the most customizable gaming mouse of 2018. If your an FPS player, Moba, MMO you name it this mouse can suit your needs because its all of those in one. The side thumbgrids can be swapped out magnetically, in under 10 seconds! By default, the mouse has the 12 button thumbgrid attached, but you can swap it for a 7 button thumbgrid like the Naga Hex, or just a set of forward and back buttons. Razer implemented this very well too, you can't even notice its detachable when using the mouse. This is truly amazing, now you can just buy one Naga, and call it a day. No more ""Naga Hex"" or ""Naga Chroma"" decisions. Besides that, you got the Chroma RGB lighting with 3 zones, just like previous Chroma enabled Nagas.

The performance is amazing. Razer FINALLY updated the Naga with an OPTICAL SENSOR! With all the backlash from the Mamba TE sensor you would have thought Razer would have switched to optical completely. The issue with the laser sensors Razer used were:

They couldn't track pixel by pixel movements very well.
They would go crazy when you lift the mouse, and had a terrible lift off distance.
Had acceleration even though it was turned off in Synapse.

The Naga Trinity now uses the Pixart PMW3389, the same sensor found in the Deathadder Elite and all other current generation Razer mice (Except the Atheris and Lancehead Wireless) and the sensor performance is amazing. Handles small movements, liftoff distance is almost non-existant, and doesn't spin out. Yeah, an MMO mouse doesn't require too much accuracy, but not everyone uses an MMO mouse for MMO's only. I wish it didn't take Razer this long to update the mouse though.

The buttons, I'm 99.9% sure they are Razer mechanical Omron switches. They are very clicky, tactile and have a nice snap, but no accidental clicks. And to all you Minecraft PVP'ers out there, they are very easy to jitterclick with! The buttons on each thumbgrid are also very tactile and easy to press, so they don't require 3 tons of thumb pressure to actuate, like the uTechSmart Venus.

The mouse is powered by Razer Synapse 3. In the software you can calibrate the mouse, reprogram the buttons, change your lighting settings, manage your warranty etc. The sky really is the limit with this mouse. And with Razer Hypsershift, you can assign secondary functions to the buttons, kind of the like FN key on a keyboard. The really is the limit.

Would I recommend this mouse? YES! I've tried the uTechSmart Venus, Corsair Scimitar, Razer Naga HEX v2 and this comes out on top. The uTechSmart has an awful sensor and is made of some form of plastic that feels like sandpaper, the Corsair Scimitar's shape is a bit too awkward for me, and the Naga Hex v2 has a terrible sensor, there's no shape like the Naga. And now that it has a top optical sensor, its possibly one of the best gaming mice ever made. Very customizable, very friendly. A bit pricey, but it worth every penny!

After the first few lessons it starts giving you mini lessons where the artist walks you through the steps that you did previously, gives you a reference photo and you get to work on your own.  There is a free paint section where you can choose your own reference photo to work from or take a photo yourself to use.  Unfortunately, there's no way to pull in a photo from the ds photo gallery or to export your work to the ds.  I believe in the 3ds version you do have the ability to export to the device.  One you finish a drawing or painting you can choose to save it to the gallery in the software, choose a frame for it, and have the ability to go through and look at your work later.

I went through all ten lessons and several mini lessons within a couple days.  It was a bit disappointing that there weren't more guided lessons.  Even so I had a blast with this.  It held my interest, reacquainted me with some techniques I had forgotten about, and taught me how to layer the paint.  I was impressed with how everything looks on the screen and how well the media in the software mimics real life media as well.  It doesn't mimic everything exactly, but it's pretty impressive for what it is.

I really liked this software.  Totally worth it for the really low price I paid for it here.

55428,4542,4332,"I know this game has a lot of fans, but I sincerely hated it. I gave it one solitary try before reaching this conclusion - but the reason is so mind-boggling idiotic that it made me question any further investment in the series whatsoever. Essentially, the first mission in the game takes (apparently) about 40-50 minutes to complete. However, during this time it has ZERO save spots. I understand that the game has no autosave, although I didn't know it when I purchased it, I had assumed however there would be some sort of save mechanic from the outset.

There is not.

For the entire first mission there is no way to save the game. This means that if you die or the game freezes you have to start from scratch - cutscenes included. Also note that there is practically zero narrative offered up until this point - just generic characters who honestly don't seem very interesting. I was proceeding along through the mission and got to the apex battle - or at least, one would assume it was the apex battle - where there are these spinning disc things trying to grind you up on a bridge. Well, I got caught in a glitch between the spinning blades and a piece of terrain - my health kept dropping, my healing items got auto-used, and I died. Then we go back to the main menu and the all-to-familiar ""continue game"" button we've all seen thousands of times isn't there. So if I wanted to continue, I'd have to start from the beginning.

No, screw that, screw this game, and screw Square Enix for making this one of the most unenjoyable gaming experiences of my life. I understand this game has a lot of high-praise, but I have zero faith in a company that made such a decision as poor as forcing players to complete the first level in one go or else start over. This is even worse when I was told that after this first level, save spots are actually quite common. ABSOLUTELY UNFORGIVABLE. This game does not deserve the rating it currently has - all I can say is thank god for Amazon's ironclad return policy.",know game lot fan sincer hate gave one solitari tri reach conclus reason mindboggl idiot made question invest seri whatsoev essenti first mission game take appar 4050 minut complet howev time zero save spot understand game autosav although didnt know purchas assum howev would sort save mechan outset entir first mission way save game mean die game freez start scratch cutscen includ also note practic zero narr offer point gener charact honestli dont seem interest proceed along mission got apex battl least one would assum apex battl spin disc thing tri grind bridg well got caught glitch spin blade piec terrain health kept drop heal item got autous die go back main menu alltofamiliar continu game button weve seen thousand time isnt want continu id start begin screw screw game screw squar enix make one unenjoy game experi life understand game lot highprais zero faith compani made,1521417600,1

55449,4217,3156,"Advertised as an open-world fps, Homefront: The Revolution plays more like a shooty Assassins Creed game (sans wall-climbing): stealth, take strongholds, fight for a few minutes, then run, hide, and wait for the alarm to dissipate before getting back to it. Stunning graphics, decent world design and story are marred by repeated activities, heavily re-used character models and numerous minor complaints. If you don't mind a little grind, it is a 7/10 and worth a purchase at $10 or less.
Total size on my hard drive (game + story DLC): 69.2 GB

++ Stunning graphics, courtesy of Cryengine.

+ Detailed environments. Smoke, dust, rubble, garbage, worn brick. Even house interiors (seen through windows) are highly detailed.
+ Secret routes. Look for ways up and around obstacles. A climb up scaffolding can provide access to a buildings interior  and a secret stash of supplies. Stuff like this is everywhere. Also applies to Stronghold takeovers; there is always more than one entrance.
+ Hit-and-run gameplay reminiscent of the old Assassins Creed games. Brady doesnt have much health; pitched battles are suicide. Get in, hit your target, get out, and (if an alarm was raised), hide.
+ The more territory you take from the enemy, the more Resistance NPCs spawn in a district (who will provide combat support). The more territory you take, the more brazen your actions can become.
+ I loved the massive aerial drones patrolling the districts. If its seeker beam finds you, you are done for. 20-30 enemies will immediately spawn (with mech backup). Forced me to move carefully and stick to buildings and cover, even in wide-open zones.
+ Motorcycle through the debris. Dont want to be stealthy? Maybe speed is more your style. Bikes are everywhere, and make rapid travel a snap.
+ Mod your weapons. Simple and easy to understand. Completely change the way a weapon functions with a few quick clicks.

+/- Story does nothing unique, but is well-told.
+/- Story DLC are excellent, though short. Recommended if you can get them cheap. Aftermath and Beyond the Walls conclude protagonist Bradys story; The Voice of Freedom is a brief prequel starring another character.
+/- Not a massive sandbox open world. Each district is its own area, with loading screens connecting them.
+/- Recruit Resistance NPCs to help with a fight. Nice in theory, but their bad AI results in them dying almost immediately.
+/- Silent protagonist in the main campaign, but not in the DLC. Odd.
+/- Optimization is still meh. Max settings @1080p saw an average of 40-50fps on my RX 470, which isn't bad (this is CryEngine were talking about).
+/- Soundtrack works. Nothing special. But kudos for having different combat and ambient themes for different districts.
+/- Some grind involved. Same activities and enemies in every district. This puts the focus on the level design (which is excellent), but it can feel same-y after while.

- Multiplayer is dead. If you have some friends, it will still work.
- Starts badly. The opening doesnt make a good first impression  of either mechanics or characters  and the first two districts underwhelm as well.
- If not for Bradys lack of health, game is too easy.
- Pitched battles are generally a bad idea, but if you can find a choke point, all the enemies will come funneling through one by one.
- No take-back. We spend the entire game taking installations from the KPA, and never once (outside of story missions) do they try to reclaim anything  not a stronghold, not an outpost, nothing.
- Re-used NPC character models. Not uncommon in a big sandbox game, but particularly egregious here.
- Not enough interaction with people. Theyre the ones were doing all of this for, and the best we ever get is having a fellow Resistance member say, Youre doing great out there, Brady. At least give me something, some personal stories told through exploring the environment (since were doing that anyway). Each district already has visual character; what of the character of the people who live there? The closest the game comes to doing this is in the collaborator district.
- Flashpoints are the same activities repeated over and over. Defend a stash, or take out a duster launch site, take out some snipers. Its great that the task of taking over the district is broken up with, Hurry here, folks are under attack! But it all starts to feel the same.

Despite its faults, I had a lot of fun here. Perhaps I was simply fortunate not to play it at release, but now, this is a competent fps game with a unique setting and gloriously detailed visuals. While not quite as packed with activities as my favorite game of revolt (Red Faction: Guerrilla), Homefront: The Revolution provides far more than its mixed reputation promises. Recommended, and I hope the new owners of Deep Silver, THQNordic, recognize this franchises potential as a guerrilla warfare fps game.",advertis openworld fp homefront revolut play like shooti assassin creed game san wallclimb stealth take stronghold fight minut run hide wait alarm dissip get back stun graphic decent world design stori mar repeat activ heavili reus charact model numer minor complaint dont mind littl grind 710 worth purchas 10 le total size hard drive game stori dlc 692 gb stun graphic courtesi cryengin detail environ smoke dust rubbl garbag worn brick even hous interior seen window highli detail secret rout look way around obstacl climb scaffold provid access build interior secret stash suppli stuff like everywher also appli stronghold takeov alway one entranc hitandrun gameplay reminisc old assassin creed game bradi doesnt much health pitch battl suicid get hit target get alarm rais hide territori take enemi resist npc spawn district provid combat support territori take brazen action becom love massiv aerial drone patrol district seeker beam find done 2030 enemi immedi spawn mech backup forc move care stick build cover even wideopen zone motorcycl debri dont want stealthi mayb speed style bike everywher make rapid travel snap mod weapon simpl easi understand complet chang way,1521417600,4

Hat's off to them for that.

Alright, so the game finally starts for me, and do you know the first.. THE FIRST THING that happens to me? I can't find my ship. I'm on a little island, wandering around. And I don't know what to do. WELL I eventually see this signal flare out in the water.. I swim to it, and its like ""Do you want to spawn back at your ship?"" Uh, yes please!

I also got attacked, on this island, right out of the gate. The same fools that attacked me had also sunk my ship. BEFORE I EVEN managed to figure out anything.

The next thing that happens, is well I got in my ship, FINALLY.. doing it solo.. and it takes me forever, but my first destination is ""Booty Island"" I figure, why not? sounds like a great name! I make it there, I wander around ""Snake island"" because that's what it really should have been called.. I then head over to ""Thieves Haven"" .. I grab a treasure chest, and I head up to.. ""Plunders Outpost"" basically an Island where you turn your stuff in.. A little hub area. I get killed, my loot stolen. And that's garbage.  Complete and utter garbage.

Do I regret my purchase? as it stands, very much so. This reminds me of the days when I started playing multiplayer on console.. I think it was Halo2.. and I got spawn killed, over and over and over. This is like the same thing.. It's junk. Who enjoys this, except the person sitting there and just waiting on someone to spawn up in a ship or something?

So its not explicitly stated, I'm sure it was in the marketing material somewhere. But this game is online only.

Also the UI for quest is kind of confusing.

You have no mini map you can open up. As far as I can tell. But who knows?

The in game UI for your items, is clunky, its straight forward, but it doesn't work well..

The combat mechanics, kinda suck.

Buy at your own risk.

I haven't bought a game like this, where I've just straight up hated it, right from the get go, in about a decade and a half..

Take my review as an over all sample of the whole, this was just my experience right from the start. Maybe if you jump in to some multiplayer with other people..and all that jazz, maybe it will work out better?

I put my system on rest mode to go to work came back and it hadn't budged.  It downloads at about 1% every 45min.  Get the disk version and hopefully that will work.  Now I see why it was only $29 for the dcl.
My fault for not reading al the reviews.  I'll let you all know if the game itself sucks...however even if it's awesome I think the hassle and bs that comes with it makes it a huge don't buy.  Hell....it's march of 2018 and the servers are still lacking...so I guess I'm screwed.

55498,4045,4205,"Overall, this mouse is pretty good. It's a nice size, the tracking is solid, the buttons are very ""clicky,"" and all the buttons are easy to reach. The adjustable weight and customizable RGB lighting are also nice touches.
All that being said, there are a few minor things that I don't like about this mouse. First, the mouse software isn't that great, especially when compared with some of the other software packages gaming mice come with. It seems rather clunky and intuitive. However, once you figure it out it isn't that bad and actually has most of the features of the more polished software. Also, I'm kind of disappointed that the RGB lighting color doesn't change when I change my dpi, even though you can set the dpi to different color lighting. For some reason, I have to open the software up and hit save to have the mouse color update to my set dpi color. Also, I kinda wish the thumb rest was larger, as I find that my thumb will sometimes slide off due to its small size.
Although I wrote a lot about what I don't like about the mouse, pretty much everything else about the mouse I didn't mention in the ""cons section"" is excellent (so they got a lot more right than they did wrong). My minor gripes aside, this is still a really solid gaming mouse. It's been very reliable so far and once you get your setup up and running, most of the minor flaws fade away. So while it's not perfect, its still pretty good and I would recommend it to someone who wants a step up from the cheaper entry level mice without breaking the bank.",overal mous pretti good nice size track solid button clicki button easi reach adjust weight customiz rgb light also nice touch said minor thing dont like mous first mous softwar isnt great especi compar softwar packag game mouse come seem rather clunki intuit howev figur isnt bad actual featur polish softwar also im kind disappoint rgb light color doesnt chang chang dpi even though set dpi differ color light reason open softwar hit save mous color updat set dpi color also kinda wish thumb rest larger find thumb sometim slide due small size although wrote lot dont like mous pretti much everyth el mous didnt mention con section excel got lot right wrong minor gripe asid still realli solid game mous reliabl far get setup run minor flaw fade away perfect still pretti good would recommend someon want step cheaper entri level mouse without break bank,1521590400,4

Amazing graphics, great voice narratives, intriguing storyline, and you get to decide who lives and who doesn't. Another neat part of this game is that they made CGI characters of real people. The butterfly effect is a major factor in this game which makes it more interesting. I highly recommend this game if you like interactive games with a movie-like feel. This game is up there with Life is Strang. I also think this game has overall better replay value than Life is Strange and is definitely worth at least one playthrough.",great choic game read review watch onlin video gameplay curiou gane decid give tri amaz graphic great voic narr intrigu storylin get decid live doesnt anoth neat part game made cgi charact real peopl butterfli effect major factor game make interest highli recommend game like interact game movielik feel game life strang also think game overal better replay valu life strang definit worth least one playthrough,1521590400,5

Its just played to have fun and honestly we need that in todays gaming world.  The only issues i've seen so far have been with the Servers (which is to be expected on release week from most games) and the lack of an option to team up with Mic'd up players only.  Occasionally, I have been teamed up with half the team on microphones and the other half not and it can definitley cause some miscommunication.

Based on reviews and recommendations, I thought I should try these out. Going in, I knew nothing about HyperX except that they sponsor several esports teams.

Pros:
- The microphone is amazing at noise reduction! This was a must have for me since my boyfriend's PC is right next to mine and I did not want to pick up him during live streams.
- Padding and medal construction felt high quality and had good stability.
- The ear cups cancel noise a lot better than most headsets. This is great for noisy houses.
- You can actually turn on/off the 7.1 audio. There's actually a large difference between the two options.

Cons:
- The ear cups were comfortable but not as comfortable as people had claimed. After wearing these for 3-4+ hours I started to feel them.
- The microphone itself sounded rather muffled. I had better mic sound quality from cheaper headsets. This was the main reason why I ended up returning them. If I was only playing games with friends, I would have kept these. But I'm streaming on Twitch to an audience. I can't have my voice sound muffled. I need crisp and clear.
- The remote on the cable has microphone volume + & - buttons. These buttons are rather pointless.

55665,2611,698,"I originally had Lords of The Fallen for Xbox One when it first debuted, and I really wasn't impressed. I actually found it to be in the same level f difficulty as Dark Souls, and traded it rather quickly thereafter. But for some reason I started wanting to give L.O.T.F. another chance, so I bought the complete edition for the PS4. And now I'm a devotee to it! (I've also recently been won over by both Dark Souls 2&3 as well as Boodborne.) The gameplay is challenging and keeps you from getting lazy without being so hard as to drive away casual gamers such as myself. There's also a more straightforward story than the mysterious and enigmatic storyline's contained in DS & Bloodborne. The controls are tight but still require patience because the player's movements are very realistically physics based, so when you begin an attack you have to kind of wind up and strike, the attack's not swift like in many other medieval style combat games. But the gameplay is really good, the graphics are crisp (I was afraid because I had heard other reviewer's say the were bugs and lags.) The controls are tight, the audio's very clear and so far I'm really enjoying Lords of The Fallen. Also, just thought I'd mention this, I received the physical copy still in the original factory seal with the download voucher included for all the add-on content, but when I redeemed the code, a message appeared that said the dlc couldn't download because it was already on the disc. So, I deleted the installed disc data to download the add-on content and got the entire standalone game along with the dlc so I don't actually need the disc at all!

I am pretty disappointed in how this product performed & at the price these cost, they should perform light years better. I feel this product is really only good for removing finger prints off of the cartridge PCB pins, which a cotton swab can already do for far, far, far less money. The only way I could recommend this product to other customers, is if they have clean cartridge pins already & that is about it.

55878,2050,1342,"Originally I had an Logitech G403 gaming mouse, while I did enjoy that mouse, it lacked two things, Comfit and enough buttons. I play games where those 3 buttons on the G403 isn't enough. This where the Corsair Scimitar comes in. It allow me to have enough buttons to a sign skills and other actions to. Since its larger and shaped better, I can move the mouse around without my hands rubbing against the desk or being uncomfortable including being able to grip it better. I did notice the mouse performing much better then my G403 did. While I still think the G403 is a good mouse, It just doesnt fit my needs.

Software wise I find the corsair software to be better then Logitech software due to the options being more easier to get too. While the G410 doesnt have RGB, just an LED light. The RGB options in the software is good, giving you different options, including letting you make themes. Being able to make lighting profiles for different games is a plus, so you know for sure which game profile is loaded. Which is handy when you made some macros for the profiles you made for games. While you can disable the lighting, I don't suggest you do, since the numbered buttons are hard to see when the lighting is turned off.

I been using it for months now, and so far I haven't had any double clicking issues that I normally have with mice. All the other buttons works perfectly, but I wish the 1-12 buttons was spaced apart a little, as I find my self hitting the wrong button, due to them being right up on each other. Buttons being flat instead of having an angle to them, also causes me to hit the wrong button, since there are times that I have to look to make sure Im hitting the right buttons. While they are textured, I don't think that is enough for the reasons I mentioned. The major  functionally about the side buttons that I really like, is being able to slide them forward or back, which is a godsend. My hands are large, so I have to move them up a tad so my thumb be resting against the top buttons, while at the same time, being able to get access to the 10-12 buttons, which would had been too close bottom of the mouse.

Over all I really enjoying this mouse, but sadly there is a glaring issue with the mouse in general, it has a known issue where at times the mouse doesnt work at boot up, Only way to make it work is to unplug it and plug it back up. It doesnt happen all the time, but still it happens. I would hopped that corsair fixes this issue, but they have not. Its not a software issue since it happens far before the software even loads up. Which ruins this mouse a lot.

I won't go into the details, but the sequel is definitely not as good as it should have been. The upside is that some of the powers have better improvements (such as Blink, which can now stop time when you are not moving), but other powers ended up becoming way worse (namely Dark Vision, which barely works in this game). Overall, even though this game is terrible compared to the first one, it's still worth getting (for no more than ~$15-20, of course).",first game amaz one pretti lacklust stori terribl mission bad even voic act declin wont go detail sequel definit good upsid power better improv blink stop time move power end becom way wors name dark vision bare work game overal even though game terribl compar first one still worth get 1520 cours,1522454400,3

55881,9467,198,"If I could give my review a 10/5 stars I would! I purchased 2 BRAND NEW SEALED PS Vita Slims with 3.55 firmware from seller Above All Games with FBA (fulfillment by Amazon). Items came in USA/NA PCH-2001 black edition, all shiny and new with seals both top and bottom of boxed packaging untouched. From my pictures the seal residues on the box front are from how these units are stored before shipment, they seem to have been stacked on top of one another. Don't worry as those are not the actual box seals (just residues) as they are on the front of the box so don't be alarmed by my images. You will see from the back of the box image I provide, untouched manufacturer seals are in tact and untouched. Everything was included in each box; PS Vita Slim PCH-2001 unit with 1GB INTERNAL memory (NO individual card, it's not included in this boxed unit, sold separately), USB cable, AC adapter, AC power cord, 2 quick start guides in English and French with safety guide booklet. Both units had more than enough charge to start up and edit your desired settings.

I purchase 2 units for both my husband and I to enjoy. I have been using the one unit since I received it and it works great for remote play using powerline wifi access point and adapter in our home. My husband setup the access point wifi in our master bedroom since our PS4 Pro unit is in our game room. Without his setup, we did notice terrible gameplay quality via remote play with just using simple private internet network. With the access point wifi in place, picture and sound quality is SUPERB on the PS Vita especially for its LCD screen. I can finally relax in bed and play my PS4 games while my husband reads his book or watches tv, and vise versa. The audio bluetooth capability of the unit also comes in handy. The one drawback to these units are the memory cards, they are expensive! I will mainly be playing with my PS Vita via remote play so I have no need for more than the internal memory that Sony has provided with the PS Vita slims. I did order an adapter memory card, but it did not fit properly on either unit. Bit the bullet and awaiting the PS Vita made memory card instead just in case for my husband's personal use with his PS Vita unit.

Overall, the risk was high when purchasing these on Amazon and picking the right seller.

55902,9467,1967,"I was so excited to receive it and started using it immediately. I'm not sure if what I got was a defect, but the L2/R2 were not as responsive and often times would not trigger the back touch screen. I ordered another L2/R2 grip along with this Joetsu grip and the other brand Hori worked perfectly. This item also had an annoying squeak on the right grip during use, it became distracting during gameplay. It was also a PAIN to remove this grip and needed my husband's help so I could ship it back to Amazon. I have no idea why it took two people to carefully remove the device... but we both held our breath as the device was a recently purchased brand new PS Vita Slim. I also purchased the matching case for this grip and let me tell you if you do not plan on remote playing with other grips that have front L2/R2 trigger grips or L3/R3 trigger grips then this grip and it's matching case is for you. Either have a really good armour skin on your Vita if you plan to put this on and off your Vita constantly because it will scratch your device (or even break the grip with too much tension).

UPDATE: After getting a new PS Vita Slim in aqua blue I decided to reorder this grip from Joetsu again. I find the Joetsu grips much more comfortable for my small hands. Happy to report that my second and third purchase of this product came with zero issues, responsive triggers with still slight squeak on the grips. The squeak is not as loud as my first order on my original review so I've been able to enjoy gameplay. I ordered the third grip as a backup seeing as vita grips sell quick and the prices end up increasing. My aqua blue vita will stay stationary in this grip so having the matching case is such a great combo. I did add a clear back film on my vita to go along with this grip to prevent any scratches from excessive use of the triggers. I did this with all 3 of my vitas, the other 2 have full body carbon skins. The main reason why this grip was finally a keeper for me besides the comfort is again the matching case. It's so nice to have one of my vitas with ready attached grip and case.

55974,9467,460,"I purchased two of these ridiculously expensive PSV memory cards from seller APEX GAMES (USA) with FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). I originally only purchased one for my husband, but after browsing Amazon and getting great deals on PS Vita games it only made sense to just get one for myself. I do want to note beforehand that the cards I received from APEX GAMES (USA) are the Asia version (Taiwan/Korea - PCH-Z641G), NOT Japan version (PCH-Z641J) like stated in the description and title. Because of this I knocked off one star as I did not receive the actual version I paid for. After reading up on differences and seeing that the G version cost more on the play-asia site (where PS Vita is commonly found), that site states the J version may experience issues with PSV 1000 devices (aka fat vitas). Now I don't own the PSV 1000, but the 2000 slim so I decided to keep the G and tested them out. So far no issues only time will tell when and if these cards deteriorate with excessive use. I was able to transfer a small saved file I had from my internal slim memory onto the card without any issues. I've read issues with both G and J versions so whatever card I got would of been a risk either way. Leave it to Sony to make a proprietary memory card that might and might not work overtime with such a high price tag. Both cards gave me 60gb of free storage. If you are wondering where the 4gb went, simple answer is system data after formatting.

UPDATE: I ordered a third 64gb PSV memory card for another PS Vita, but this time from seller cus mart and got exactly as advertised! BRAND NEW SEALED PCH-Z641J and is in working order. So far both Japan (PCH-Z641J) and Asia (PCH-Z641G) versions of this 64gb memory card has been working perfectly since purchase.

I was worried before placing my order since the image description has the day one edition cover, but the description doesn't mention any of the DLC contents. After receiving the product, I was thrilled to see that it was indeed the physical copy of the day one edition. The reason why I wanted the day one edition of this game is because the pre-orders, limited and one day editions are the only copies that came with the Japanese voice overs, Sephiroth summon, white chocobo, glow moogle and red bonnetberry. The English voice over for the original copy of the game is terrible! There were a handful of English voice over characters that made me cringe. Characters talk throughout the game not just during cuts scenes, so having the desired voice over for me was important. Now I can finally enjoy this game with much better voice acting and Sephiroth by my side.

It's hard to recommend games as everyone has a specific genre and style, but if you have been playing Final Fantasy in the very beginning then you will enjoy playing this game. I've never been into Pokemon/Digimon type games, but I am immersed with this game. The storyline is good, I particularly enjoy Lann's character, he always makes me laugh.

Unfortunately, my old Steelseries Kana was breaking down. Time for an upgrade. I bought my first Kana in late 2013. It was the best gaming mouse I ever held. The ambidextrous feel, the same buttons on both the thumb and pinky side. Not overly cluttered like those awful 12 button MMO mice.
The left clicker stopped responding in December of '15. Lasted almost 2 years. I bought another Kana since they were still being sold. That is the one that this Sensei 310 is replacing. I can no longer get the Kana, but the Sensei 310 fits the job just as good, if not better. This one also adds 2 another button on both the thumb and pinky sides. No complaints. Until further notice I'll definitely recommend Steelseries over Logitech, Corsair and most importantly Razer.

56018,9467,699,"I purchased  two of these Hori protectors from seller JADD ENTERTAINMENT with FBA (fulfilled by Amazon). This is the third out of four PS Vita Slim protector brands I have tried. This Hori failed me just like the brands Gam3Gear and Akwox. Only the brand Mr Shield did everything I wanted from any screen protector. Anyways, I read the comments and watched videos of how to apply this Hori screen protector so I came prepared. I used a strong electric air blower and a keyboard vacuum during the whole installation process. I wanted to make sure no dust was anywhere on the device screens. I even made sure to blow dry the underside that you are suppose to peel off, steps 2 and 3 backing sheets. So when it is slowly being peeled off it hopefully wouldn't drop any dust particles all over the screen when the protector starts to adhere onto the device. Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 process was a pain for the first PS Vita device I installed this on. There was a lot of particles that got caught when the two backing got peeled off, sigh. I had to use scotch tape onto the protector to lift it and remove the particles stuck under the actual screen protector. It was not a fun process. On the second device was the same but this time there was a rainbow effect on the underside of the screen protector. I completely forgot to take a photo as the whole process stressed me out. No matter how much I pressed the protector, the rainbow effect just wouldn't go away. I ended up applying a different protector (Mr Shield) on the second device that worked so much better and took less than 3 minutes to apply. I will be removing this Hori protector off the first device as I don't feel it will protect my screen at all. Waste of $30 for 2 of these terrible Hori film ""protectors"".

This protector is also not edge to edge size as I was hoping for. It is also one of the thinnest screen protector I have ever come across... so thin you wonder if it'll even protect anything. It's thinner than the protective backing that you peel off the protector during application. It also has an annoying straight line in the middle of the protector from the peel off backing. It comes in 2 separate backing film that you peel right then the left (steps 2 and 3). Step 1 is a tab you peel off the back and it's what you use to stick onto the screen while you align the protector. This step 1 was useless because as you start peeling off the backing, the whole protector starts to move around even when you are firmly pressing it down. The only positive things I can say about this protector is how invisible it looks once applied and how easy it was to get the bubbles out. The thinness of this item is what makes it look seamless and almost invisible. The question is, how much will it actually protect your screen? This is literally like the film you find on brand new electronic devices when you first buy them that protects it from fingerprints... even though this Hori still catches fingerprints like crazy.

For the price and only getting one thin film type ""protector"" per kit, I'd look elsewhere if you are serious about keeping your screen from any serious scratches.

ETA: I decided to play with my Vita before removing this Hori protector. I didn't like the feel of the protector at all, had a very semi-rough cheap film feeling to it. There was some missed touch screen responses that had me worried that it might of been my brand new Vita, but come to find out it wasn't soon as I did the Welcome Park app. The line that I mention in my original review was annoyingly visible during gameplays that had white/light colored backgrounds. It's hard to capture a close up picture of the imperfections unless you see them in person. Even after my hard work of almost 2 hours of applying this protector on two different Vitas, there was still so many imperfections underneath the protector. Removing the two film backing while it adheres to the screen is such a major flaw imo, so many dust will fall... just look closely and use a flashlight if you already own this protector. The screen looks better without this protector on. The feel, middle line and collected dust outweighs the esthetic of ""invisible"" look of this protector. Extremely disappointed with this product and have no idea why so many praised it.",purchas two hori protector seller jadd entertain fba fulfil amazon third four p vita slim protector brand tri hori fail like brand gam3gear akwox brand mr shield everyth want screen protector anyway read comment watch video appli hori screen protector came prepar use strong electr air blower keyboard vacuum whole instal process want make sure dust anywher devic screen even made sure blow dri undersid suppos peel step 2 3 back sheet slowli peel hope wouldnt drop dust particl screen protector start adher onto devic step 1 2 3 4 process pain first p vita devic instal lot particl got caught two back got peel sigh use scotch tape onto protector lift remov particl stuck actual screen protector fun process second devic time rainbow effect undersid screen protector complet forgot take photo whole process stress matter much press protector rainbow effect wouldnt go away end appli differ protector mr shield second devic work much better took le 3 minut appli remov,1522800000,1

56021,7606,4099,"So i haven't beaten the game (yet) but im in the meat and potatoes of the plot. The story is kind of lame. The dialouge of the npcs is really hit or miss. Very jrpg dialouge. I like it. Some will despise it. Let me just tell you, don't buy this game expecting plot twists and character development. Characters are very cliche and you can smell the plot advances a mile away.

Now onto the gameplay.
You are going to do battle alot. Not out of joy or even just because you get attacked randomly in dungeons but out of necessity. There is a gem system that basically dictates what the enemy will drop. You need these to get any good gear (wich you will absolultley need to defeat bosses). So 9 times out of ten i am farming for gems and then using rhe gems to get items.

None of the enemies in the game pose a real threat. You can just about mash x until the enemies are dead. The boss fights are leagues beyond the normal enemies. You will get one shotted if your gear isn't up to par. The boss fights are totally worth it though. You actually have to use abilities and play strategically. I wish that more of the regular enemies were so mindlesly dealt with but im not complaining. The difficulty spike with the bosses is really just padding to make the game longer. Wich is ok in my book.
I love to grind and this game gives that to me with a sense of accomishment every so often.

There is a demon system where you summon them and they do their thing but nothinf really game changing. They make exploring easier for the most part and will help out in a pinch.

All in all i like this game because i can go in a dungeon and mindlessly grind while im in going somerwhere. You can save often wich makes this even better. The story, while being extremely predictable, did pull on my heart strings. The dialouge is hit or miss. And the combat can be tedious but also rewarding. So i give this game a 4/5. If the story were better 5/5. Nothing really drags this game down except for the story.",havent beaten game yet im meat potato plot stori kind lame dialoug npc realli hit miss jrpg dialoug like despis let tell dont buy game expect plot twist charact develop charact clich smell plot advanc mile away onto gameplay go battl alot joy even get attack randomli dungeon necess gem system basic dictat enemi drop need get good gear wich absolultley need defeat bos 9 time ten farm gem use rhe gem get item none enemi game pose real threat mash x enemi dead bos fight leagu beyond normal enemi get one shot gear isnt par bos fight total worth though actual use abil play strateg wish regular enemi mindlesli dealt im complain difficulti spike bos realli pad make game longer wich ok book love grind game give sen accomish everi often demon system summon thing nothinf realli game chang make explor easier part help pinch,1522800000,4

56030,9431,942,"I remember the first time I played a Dark Souls game, it was Demon Souls and I thought it was the most clunky, frustrating action/RPG I had ever played. But if you're familiar with the series, you know what I'm going to say. I just had to figure it out. I had to make it work right. I then spent a couple of months laboring away at and understanding the series.

Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin was my third Dark Souls game and I thoroughly enjoy it but it's missing something, isn't it? Either that or I've figured these games out. I've not, I can still go back to Demon's Souls and get my butt handed to me. This is a fun game, it's really a better place to start than Dark Souls or Demons Souls just because you're not likely to get as frustrated and mad at this one. There's a part of me that doesn't even know if this series is in my top 5 favorite or top 5 most hated. I get a new Dark Souls game and let it set there. Looking at me. Knowing the beating it will give me but not Dark Souls II. Lots of weapons, lots of bosses (not as impressive as the others in the series), great atmosphere in all these games. A tip from someone who hates spoilers and who doesn't like multiplayer games. You can summon someone to help you if stuck. I hate that! Why do I need help? I'll play it 1,000 times! So, yeah, not for sure if I love it or hate it. I will say I buy every Dark Souls game and have played through all them without needing to summon any help. It has added gray to my beard and taken years off my life but it can be done. I'm also sort of kidding about the hatred part. After awhile you either quit or just accept that you're going to get killed over and over until that one perfect moment when you do something right and make it. It reminds me of older video games. Kind of like the difficulty and frustration of the old Mega Man and Castlevania games. Last, this one isn't near as hard. My son (12 at the time) beat it and he won't even hardly play the others. Good series to test your patience and luck too.",rememb first time play dark soul game demon soul thought clunki frustrat actionrpg ever play your familiar seri know im go say figur make work right spent coupl month labor away understand seri dark soul ii scholar first sin third dark soul game thoroughli enjoy miss someth isnt either ive figur game ive still go back demon soul get butt hand fun game realli better place start dark soul demon soul your like get frustrat mad one there part doesnt even know seri top 5 favorit top 5 hate get new dark soul game let set look know beat give dark soul ii lot weapon lot bos impress other seri great atmospher game tip someon hate spoiler doesnt like multiplay game summon someon help stuck hate need help ill play 1000 time yeah sure love hate say buy everi dark soul game play without need summon help ad gray beard,1522800000,4

There's quite a bit of exploring, complete with the timed/rushed feeling, there's parkour, kind of like playing Assassin's Creed without the restraints. It's a lot of fun to play by yourself. I think that's why a lot of zombie games don't interest as much. Seems like most are multiplayer. It's hard to believe but you can get a solid 100 hours out of this version of Dying Light.

56079,9431,2453,"I've always thought Rockstar was one-step from making GTA into a perfect game but they always had to get too cute with GTA. Not with RDR, even the Undead DLC is a ton of fun. What's more fun than jumping on an automatic mounted chain-machine gun and mowing down hordes of zombies? I think a big part of the fun with RDR is the main character John. Unlike GTA, especially V, you don't feel a polarizing feeling towards John. The story and his backstory draws you in. You could be just like him .. you know, if you lived in the old west. You're going to get attached to the character, his family and you'll even enjoy the parts that normally would feel repetitive. I will say Skyrim and Fallout are also good at doing this. All video games, in my 30+ years of gaming, become boring. They drag. It's going to happen but if the developer can make you feel like you're accomplishing something for your character, you don't notice it as much. RDR does that. I'll give an example with GTA. I really like the GTA games but I eventually get tired of ""playing by the rules"". Like when GTA San Andreas had you destroying the comic book guy's remote helicopter toys and you had to use a remote helicopter toy to do it. In RDR, there's no real restrictions, if you can kill those legendary animals with a knife, have at it. Want to throw dynamite at them? You can. Or you find them from a distance, get your Carcano Rifle out and try to snipe the elusive beast.

My teenage son said it best, ""Everything in it feels epic"". I think that's what makes this game so great. From the side challenges like trying to skin X amount of a certain wild animal to trying to poke a knife between your fingers in a QTE game to my personal favorite moment of the game. You've just realized you have a bunch of animal skins to sell but haven't saved. Then you hear it. The sound of a cougar attacking. Those will kill you before you can get your gun pulled, kill your horse too. It's such a fun, intense moment in a usually mid-paced game. The characters throughout the game are either crazy or hilarious or both. Just wait until you have to run behind the bank and hunt the critters. It's a relatively violent, harsh game that doesn't use gore or shock to make it violent. It's almost like an old west simulator. I've had Red Dead Redemption 2 preordered since last summer. Even worse, I decided to switch from the XB1 to PS4, so now I'm going to have to cancel my XB1 preorder and preorder it on PS4. I would rate it as one of the greatest games ever made. The game that comes the closest in old west style is Gun. Nowhere near as challenging as RDR but similar gameplay and setting. By the way, it works great on BC. I've played it all the way through twice on 360, once on XB1 BC and wouldn't be surprised if I try it on PS Now.",ive alway thought rockstar onestep make gta perfect game alway get cute gta rdr even undead dlc ton fun what fun jump automat mount chainmachin gun mow hord zombi think big part fun rdr main charact john unlik gta especi v dont feel polar feel toward john stori backstori draw could like know live old west your go get attach charact famili youll even enjoy part normal would feel repetit say skyrim fallout also good video game 30 year game becom bore drag go happen develop make feel like your accomplish someth charact dont notic much rdr ill give exampl gta realli like gta game eventu get tire play rule like gta san andrea destroy comic book guy remot helicopt toy use remot helicopt toy rdr there real restrict kill legendari anim knife want throw dynamit find distanc get carcano rifl tri snipe elus beast teenag son said best everyth feel epic think that make game great side challeng like tri skin x,1522886400,5

Pros About What I like:
1.  Amazing thoughtful packaging
2.  Good sturdy build quality
3.  Extremely useful audio control hardware adapter (this rocks!)
4.  Working almost seamlessly with a PC

Cons
1.  7.1 Sound is tinny and prioritizes sound in it's own way not able to blend game sounds with music with voice over conversations
2.  If your PC is on your right side the chord comes out of the left ear and goes across your body

Either I'll end up returning these or I'll just plug my Sennheiser's into the HyperX adapter and game without the microphone.",main headphon sennheis hd 598 lack usb microphon need game like listen music play competit game impress use headphon condit pro like 1 amaz thought packag 2 good sturdi build qualiti 3 extrem use audio control hardwar adapt rock 4 work almost seamlessli pc con 1 71 sound tinni priorit sound way abl blend game sound music voic convers 2 pc right side chord come left ear goe across bodi either ill end return ill plug sennheis hyperx adapt game without microphon,1522972800,3

Also the programmable buttons make playing so much more easier. the laser tracks extremely quickly and all the buttons are responsive. I only have two gripes... (1) It is somewhat small... and the programmable buttons are even smaller. (2) The cable itself is somewhat flimsy... I with they would have spent a little more and made it braided.

56372,9570,3465,"I genuinely love my this thing, and it makes playing games on my TV super awesome and comfortable, but there were a few minor gripes that i shared with most people, but they are super easy to address and get over if you're willing to put in just a little effort to make a great idea of a product with a pretty spot on execution that much better. Corsair just missed the mark on a couple things, but what manufacturer doesn't? For me, the lapdog was the best option to game as i currently don't have room for a desk for my PC, but eventually will, and wanted to solid keyboard/mouse that I didn't want to upgrade from until long in the future. I got the k70 before knowing about the lapdog, and saw it after purchasing the keyboard and had to have it. Then I saw the reviews on it, and at a glance, they're pretty scary with a lot of them being 1-3 stars. But they were mostly over magnets not staying in, or occasional connections issues (I've experienced a grand total of 2 connections issues since October but unplugging the power/usb cable at the lapdog immediately solved it) and the biggest complaint I've seen was the lack of wrist rest.
I actually got mine on newegg because it was cheaper at the time of purchase, but I'm posting here to share what I've done to improve my overall experience with my lapdog in hopes that it will help someone else see past the bad reviews to see this things potential like I did. Or if a current owner comes back to leave a review or check some troubleshooting tips, this might help shed new light on the matter.

First - Biggest complaint from people, and rightfully so, was the lack of wrist rest. But Corsair includes one already! Albeit, its the rest that comes with the keyboard itself, but it's still there, and its not doing anything after you put it into the lapdog anyway. Disassemble it by unscrewing the screws on the bottom, and take the top textured portion and secure it to the aluminum piece of the lapdog at the bottom of the keyboard with double sided tape, it should fit perfectly there. I STRONGLY recommend 3M's extreme mounting tape or their exterior mounting tape.

Second - If you want the best comfort, order a replacement wrist rest from Corsair to use for the mouse pad portion. They can be found on Corsair's website for around $10. Cut it to length and do the same thing as above (i left the 2 screws at the bottom of the mouse pad out and replaced with magnets, but its not 100% necessary as the top 2 screws hold everything tight enough)

Third - play around with the position of the foam pad, i find myself flipping it one way or the other depending on where/how I'm sitting

Fourth - If you have loose ports (I only had 1, but others complain about all of them) then take the cover off the USB but under the mouse pad, and gently pry the tabs on the USB ports to allow them more grip on your USB devices.

as a side note, if you've got a version of Windows that allows you to sign in with one of those fingerprint readers, i recommend getting a small USB base one and populating one of the ports on the side of the lapdog with it. Makes signing in all the bit faster and easier.

56374,9608,2754,"Short version:
Status: Returned after a few minutes of using.
Reason: I can hear a buzzing sound when the mic is turned on.

Long version:
Sound: the sound itself is definitely better than most headphones of this price. So that's definitely a win.
Mic quality: from my testing (using Discord), the mic quality is not too loud or quiet. The sound is clear.
Ease of use: easy. USB Plug and play and you're done.
Downside: I can hear an constant electronic buzzing sound. I tested every way possible and turns out the sound only happens when the mic is enabled and in use. For example, during voice chat if I disable the mic, the buzzing is gone. Yes, I checked the volume setting and everything. I tested it on every USB port on 2 different Windows 10 machines, same exact behaviors.
I had my roommate tested it as well (to make sure I wasn't just hearing things) and it took him 5 minutes of me constantly turning mic off and on in a quiet room for him to notice it. And he's not annoyed by it, but I was (hence returned).
My quick search for solution tells me that it's common among USB headphones... though my roommate's headphones (different model and brand) don't produce the buzzing sound.

Edit:
This may or may not be a faulty product. It may just be that this specific model doesn't satisfy my expectations for headphones and, thus, I requested for refund.

Wow.  Five hours in now and I just don't understand what makes this an incredible game to so many people.  It reminds me of the Darksiders series.  A run of the mill hack and slash on rails with a high skill ceiling but not much in terms of narrative or exploration.  The graphics also have not aged well for a 2015 release.  Despite this games incredible popularity there has been no remaster or 4K update for PS Pro.  Most other exclusives got one so this seems a really odd omission by Sony.

I made the mistake of not paying attention to the picture that showed it wasn't a licensed  (SONY) memory card and that's on me. But to make sure you guys don't make the same mistake just get the Sony one and not have to do this crap twice. I only play RPG games so not being able to save really sucks. But lesson learned.

56512,751,319,"I miss the days you could pop a disc in, type in a product key, and you were ready to play within 30 or so minutes. No internet connection, no online authentication, no proprietary game launchers. Just the game you bought and you. Bought this game for my wife and it is a damn nightmare to get it up and running. So many problems, I couldn't believe it. Let me break it down.

1. You need to set up an Origin account. This one isn't the worst, but I find it annoying that I need to create an EA login and password just to play a game I bought. I don't plan on using Origin for anything else, so this is definitely an inconvenience.

2. Origin constantly crashes. I tried installing this on my wife's computer, which is windows 10. Origin would crash a few seconds after launching so I tried a few things - restarted the PC, checked for any updates, checked drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled Origin. Nothing worked. Tried googling the problem and it seems to be a common occurrence - Origin does not play nice with windows 10. So I tried launching Origin through compatibility modes for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. None of them were stable. They all crashed. Great. I then tried installing it on MY laptop, which is still windows 7 by default and after a few brief crashes, it finally loaded the store and let me type in the product code. THANK GOODNESS.

3. There is no way to install from the DVD that came with the game. When you insert the disc, an autolaunch window pops up telling you to install Origin, set up EA account, and then install Sims 4. Ok. I did the first two things....let me install Sims 4. But it won't. There are no options. If you click continue, it will just try to install Origin again. So you close it, pop the disc out, pop it in....and it loops the same prompts. Install Origin, Set up account...I GET IT. I already did those things. SO...I look through my Origin launcher for options. Nothing about installing from disc, only lets you download. Great. Now I gotta wait HOURS for this thing to download 10 gigs of data so I can play the game I ALREADY BOUGHT AND HAVE A DVD INSTALL DISC FOR. What a waste of time.

Don't bother with this crap. Just play the old games. EA is too worried about making sure the costumer jumps through hoops to authenticate their purchase that it just is not worth it in the end.

56517,9467,2272,"Ever since I purchased a PS Vita PCH-2001 (USA/NA) version, I've been eyeing this aqua blue PCH-2000 (Japan) version like a hawk. The last two digits after each PS Vita numbers are region codes; example PCH-2001 is 01 USA code, PCH-2000 is 00 Japan code etc. I'm seeing some reviewers who have the PCH-2006 and little do these consumers know that the product they received from some of these sellers are the Asia 06 Hong Kong/Korea code version. I have no issues with any PS Vita versions, but I like to get what I actually paid for, and in this case I strictly wanted the Japanese aqua blue. You can also tell if it's the Japanese version during your first initial setup of the device, it will default to Tokyo.

I took a chance and made a purchase from seller cus mart with FBA (fulfilled by Amazon) of same day delivery. Everything arrived on time and the product came in BRAND NEW SEALED boxed. The PS Vitas in Japan are still in production and they actually do not have clear seals. The seller I purchased from added them as extra security and I'm very grateful. All PS Vitas are region free so I'm able to enjoy all of my new physical and digital games on this device. This device only comes stocked with 1GB internal memory, so I went ahead and purchased a 64gb from the same seller and they did not disappoint. Extremely happy with my new PS Vita, it's an absolute beauty in person! It's hard to describe how stunning the color of this device is as I noticed in different lighting it will either look darker or lighter. The entire body except for the back touchpad is all matte finish so no fingerprints - yeay!

The X and O button functions on the Japanese versions are reversed and can easily be changed in the accessibility menu under settings. I recommend just leaving the X and O on default as it's only reversed on the LiveArea screen. Once a USA/NA game starts it defaults to what western gamers are accustomed to, X=confirm, O=cancel/back. You can also login to any PSN region you have, but be aware only one account per PS Vita, blame Sony. If you have multiple PS Vita proprietary memory cards, you can set each memory card with a different PSN, again blame Sony. Other than that, this PCH-2000 version functions just like the USA/NA PCH-2001 version. For those curious, my model version came stocked with 3.65 firmware. If you are looking for firmware below this, it is best to ask the seller of your choice as these are still in production and very popular in Japan.",ever sinc purchas p vita pch2001 usana version ive eye aqua blue pch2000 japan version like hawk last two digit p vita number region code exampl pch2001 01 usa code pch2000 00 japan code etc im see review pch2006 littl consum know product receiv seller asia 06 hong kongkorea code version issu p vita version like get actual paid case strictli want japanes aqua blue also tell japanes version first initi setup devic default tokyo took chanc made purchas seller cu mart fba fulfil amazon day deliveri everyth arriv time product came brand new seal box p vita japan still product actual clear seal seller purchas ad extra secur im grate p vita region free im abl enjoy new physic digit game devic devic come stock 1gb intern memori went ahead purchas 64gb seller disappoint extrem happi new p vita absolut beauti person hard describ stun color devic notic differ light either look darker lighter entir bodi except back touchpad matt finish fingerprint yeay x,1523836800,5

56583,6420,1062,"To start off this game has far to many 5 star reviews while the game itself is just a prime example of Nintendo again deciding to rest on their laurels. I also find it incredibly egregious that Nintendo constantly finds the need to make something like an FPS kiddie and cute. It would be nice if Nintendo would put more effort into marketing titles like Mad World and No More heroes better.

First of all paint mechanic aside this is basically just an FPS with a paint mechanic and chock full of Nintendo tropes so if you are a FPS fan go to another console, this title will not satisfy your trigger hungry thumbs. However since it is Nintendo there is a lot of fun to be had with this title, the single player campaign is fun albeit to short. While I know the Wii-U is very much a dead system I had no problem finding a match online.

56616,795,4375,"I am giving it 5 stars because it resolves one big issue with the Wii and Wii versions, you have to hold the huge and heavy Wii Remote in one hand while dancing. This was causing a huge problem for me since no matter how much I played or how little, my arm was constantly sore from holding that Wii Remote all the time. I have zero arm or shoulder problems. Well this fixed the problem since the joy-con is much lighter, I don't even feel like I am holding anything and I can play normally now without arm soreness.

With that being said this game is still not without issues, like previous versions of Just Dance, not all the moves register even if you do them exactly, it just seems like the controls miss some moves and its always the same moves every time when doing the song. Its obvious that some songs are programmed much better than others. Some songs you can hit 4-5 stars the first time, other songs I can barely hit 2 stars no matter how much I practice. Basically, you still won't be able to get 100% points on any song with the Joy-Con controls.  Perhaps someone here has gotten a perfect score on a song, but throughout all the time I have played every Just dance game for Wii and Wii U I have not gotten a fully 100% perfect score on any song,

Because the switch is portable and includes a screen, you can break out the switch and dance at any time, the 2 Joy-Con's included with the Switch do the job, so you don't need to buy or bring anything extra if you are going portable.

This game also allows you to use your smartphone as the controller, how good of an idea that is, well that is debatable, however you cannot combine controls, so you can't have 3 players using Joy-Con's and 3 players using smartphones, all players must use the same control scheme.

This game does offer incredible replay value though, there are a ton of modes in the game, and a ton of unlockables, much more value than the first games in the series. You do miss the camera modes since the Nintendo Switch is missing a camera.

The unlimited subscription is only a trial, and lasts for 3 months, otherwise you have to pay more money to continue playing the songs included on unlimited, thankfully I knew about this subscription model before buying the game. I won't be purchasing a subscription to unlimited as I don't think its worth it as there are still many songs from the earlier games that I like that are missing in the unlimited section. I suggest playing the songs that are on unlimited during the 3 months then revert back to the original set of songs that came with the game after the subscription expires. You still get the same amount of unlocked songs that you would have gotten in previous just dance games before they started the subscription model so its not like they are taking away original content with unlimited.",give 5 star resolv one big issu wii wii version hold huge heavi wii remot one hand danc caus huge problem sinc matter much play littl arm constantli sore hold wii remot time zero arm shoulder problem well fix problem sinc joycon much lighter dont even feel like hold anyth play normal without arm sore said game still without issu like previou version danc move regist even exactli seem like control miss move alway move everi time song obviou song program much better other song hit 45 star first time song bare hit 2 star matter much practic basic still wont abl get 100 point song joycon control perhap someon gotten perfect score song throughout time play everi danc game wii wii u gotten fulli 100 perfect score song switch portabl includ screen break switch danc time 2 joycon includ switch job dont need buy bring anyth extra go portabl game also allow use smartphon control good,1524096000,5

56635,5064,1819,"UPDATE (4/28/18): Razer emailed me to tell me that they just discovered that this is not compatible with iOS. So at this time, if you have a Mac do not buy this.

The Razer Mamba HyperFlux and Firefly bundle is a pretty incredible piece of engineering, an extremely light and sensitive mouse that is wirelessly powered from the mousepad it sits on. Like so many of Razer's products there is a colorful glow emanating from the devices that I think is really cool (and drives my wife nuts). If the device worked as advertised it would be a 5-star for sure. The mouse is extremely light because it doesn't need to have the battery onboard to work wirelessly. And it is incredibly responsive and sensitive to even slight movements; I can't discern any lag between moving my hand and the on-screen movement. This makes it optimal not only for gaming but also for productivity. So it could function as an all-purpose mouse, not just gaming.

The mouse has multiple configurable buttons, and the colors are advertised as configurable as well. However, after an hour+ and multiple install-uninstall efforts, all with the guidance of customer support I could not get the Razer software to recognize the device at all on my Mac. Based on my interaction in the Razer forum, Mac is just not well supported, usually involving a lot of bugs and a long delay in supporting any operating system upgrade. This is advertised as being Mac compatible, and the mouse does work immediately upon plugging it in, but the only thing that works is the movement and the standard two mouse buttons.",updat 42818 razer email tell discov compat io time mac buy razer mamba hyperflux firefli bundl pretti incred piec engin extrem light sensit mous wirelessli power mousepad sit like mani razer product color glow eman devic think realli cool drive wife nut devic work advertis would 5star sure mous extrem light doesnt need batteri onboard work wirelessli incred respons sensit even slight movement cant discern lag move hand onscreen movement make optim game also product could function allpurpos mous game mous multipl configur button color advertis configur well howev hour multipl installuninstal effort guidanc custom support could get razer softwar recogn devic mac base interact razer forum mac well support usual involv lot bug long delay support oper system upgrad advertis mac compat mous work immedi upon plug thing work movement standard two mous button,1524096000,2

56637,9263,4509,"A gorgeous, emotional, fast-paced and thoughtful installment in the God of War series.

Kratos is still the beastly and enraged protagonist we all know and love, but this series adds a totally different dimension to his character: Being a dad. It is simply fascinating to watch Kratos rip off the head of an enemy in one scene, and then sternly--yet softly--instruct his son how to be a warrior the next. There are even moments in the game when Kratos has to resist showing too much affection towards his teachable, but fallible, sidekick. Teaching him too softly, he reasons, will not serve him well going forward.

On that note, Atreus is hardly a burden. His quick wit and fiery dedication to Kratos makes him a surprisingly useful and fun companion. Not once have I felt like he was in the way or unnecessary to the mission at hand, nor does utilizing his skills to fend off foes interrupt your present concerns/encounters. In fact, as you will find out, you will struggle to defeat certain enemies without him.

The story is clearer and engaging than past entries, with the transitions between cutscenes and gameplay a totally seamless experience. The action ramps up quickly, the puzzles are challenging and rewarding, and the landscape is worth exploring.

This is all I will say for now. This is an experience worth playing to be believed!",gorgeou emot fastpac thought instal god war seri krato still beastli enrag protagonist know love seri add total differ dimens charact dad simpli fascin watch krato rip head enemi one scene sternlyyet softlyinstruct son warrior next even moment game krato resist show much affect toward teachabl fallibl sidekick teach softli reason serv well go forward note atreu hardli burden quick wit fieri dedic krato make surprisingli use fun companion felt like way unnecessari mission hand util skill fend foe interrupt present concernsencount fact find struggl defeat certain enemi without stori clearer engag past entri transit cutscen gameplay total seamless experi action ramp quickli puzzl challeng reward landscap worth explor say experi worth play believ,1524182400,5

56639,256,4509,"One of the best (if not the best) games of this console generation so far.

This is a dark, mature action adventure game that will last around ~20-30 hour game (with no filler content) depending on how much you explore, and difficulty level you selected with emphasis on quality over quantity.

The game has a very nice pacing/progression system that feels very natural. The game does not hand hold you, or set you to your own devices; rather gives you enough information to figure things out on your own

Different from past God of War (GOW) games is that, this game is a over shoulder 3rd person view vs isometric view (camera with birds eye view panning in and out). The camera is very tight fixed, and behind kratos making it more grounded and personal. Entire game is pretty much one-shot (assuming you don't get any game over screen).

The game has beautiful environment and the lighting is very impressive. It runs
1080p 30fps on PS4 (original or slim)
4k 30fps, and performance mode 1080 60fps (dips at times) on the PS4 Pro

If you play on PS4 pro it's preferred you play at 30fps. The combat this time around is less combo based than past games, and more methodical as it's more about precision hits, quick turns*, and dodging; being aware of your surroundings due to the fixed over the shoulder view. So 60fps is not really necessary unless maybe you're playing on the hardest difficulty mode.
 * For quick turns there's a learning curve to keep form being disoriented during right corridors.

Sound is amazing. Get your headset or home theater system ready because you're in for a treat as the game has really nice surround sound option. Does not support 3D audio in the PlayStation Platinum headset which is disapointing. Hope they add it in, in the future.

Music typical for GOW games with drums, string instruments and orchestral vocals that really gets you pumped up

There are some audio ques that help unlock hidden items so keep an ear out

Interaction/dialogue with kratos and his son feel very real and not dialed in or exaggerated. very nice banter between the two and other characters as well

-Story:
As mentioned before, very mature yet dark. The story is more narrative driven and has more character development than past games where you're just full of rage and kill everything in sight. Each character has complex motivations in what they're set out to do

Takes place in Norse mythology instead of Geek

The main plot is that Kratos' wife has died and she wants her ashes spread from the highest mountain

Kratos takes his son with him on this journey and through a bonding experience they both grow stronger as they reach their final destination. the journey isn't that simple as it seems as there are twist and turns along the way and enemies they have to face

You do get some insight on how Kratos reach this land after GOW3, but it's sprinkled throughout instead of one long exposition

 Side quests brings out lore of the game and also way to upgrade your skill tree

There are boat sections in the game where Kratos gives his son life lessons, conversely his son gives inside knowledge of the world he learned through observation/what he learned from his mother; which makes you more invested in the characters.

-Gameplay
The combat has a lot of layers/options to it.

Instead of Quick Timed Events (QTE) there's a stun meter which which needs to be filled up for kratos make his signature final finishing moves on enemies. Feels very natural as you don't get a huge button prompt the middle of the screen

I like how the core combat is mapped to the trigger buttons instead of the face buttons making combat feel more natural

There's a skill tree that cater to how you want to play: defensive, offensive, focus on physical or magical attacks, range vs close combat, master a weapon over the other, etc

You can upgrade weapons and armor by collecting materials

Kratos' main weapon this time around is the leviathan axe (very similar to Thor's (Marvel movies/comics) weapon Mjolnir)  instead of his chained blades of chaos. You can throw the axe and have it call back to you like a boomerang. You can swing and throw the axe at enemies and fun to master as you have to judge the timing of when the axe will return to you as without your axe you may only have your bare fists to do battle till it comes back

There is some strategy involved especially in the higher difficulty settings. Some enemies are super effective against certain weapons/skills you have to be aware of

Krato's son comes along with you on the journey and is able to help with by stunning/detract enemies with an arrow which you can control the activation. Overtime as he becomes more experienced in combat more options are available. He'll also yell out tips when needed** or jump onto enemies to slow them down. Also you can view his journals after you defeat an enemy to find out hidden weaknesses

**Seeing the camera is so tight, he'll give you tips you are not able to see at times due to blind spots

Armor and clothes can be crafted, purchased, or upgraded via dwarf blacksmiths in game . It changes krato's physical appearance in game. Some armor/clothing piece has slots for enchantments which effects stats

Enemies attack you gorilla style as they can attack at anytime they want instead of gathering up in a circle and attacking one by one. Each enemy have different variety of skills, health, size, weakness and speed

There are backtracking at times that builds on exploration. Also the environments sometimes change when going back making the location feel different yet the same. There's also hidden areas you cannot access until you get a particular item giving the game this somewhat of a metriod-mania style to it

Through mini objectives like kills specific about of enemies to get exp rewards

Side quest gives you glimpse of story narrative, exp gain and or material. It doesn't feel like fetch quests or something you have to do to directly upgrade your character . There's no fluff and the side quests does not feel tacked on as it feels necessary, yet optional

You'll naturally stumble onto some side quests as the map only shows an overview of the land with a compass that points you to your main objective. Fast travel is limited, making exploration in the forefront. There's not too many side quests making it feel open and direct at the same time

First- the game looks great! It is a graphical achievement for the PS4 but unfortunately still sees some frame rate issues on the PS4 Pro. The level of detail on characters and in the environment is amazing, so hats off for that.

The story is ok as it is just another journey that seems small but has a lot of struggles along the way. During the story you do see your two main characters grow and bond, which is nice.

Now for combat- This is probably the worst part for me. The over the shoulder camera is not meant for combat at all, and it's ridiculous. Your actions feel slow and weak, and some monsters do substantial amounts of damage in little cheap shots. Out of my 12 hours of play time I've maybe died 5 times, which isn't bad, but the fighting is just not fun at all, or more like a love hate, as in it is fun sometimes, but most times not.

Character cuatomization is simple and easy to understand, just be sure to loot as much as possible as upgrades and gear can get pricey at first.

56698,2467,1466,"My 5 year old mouse with 2k+ hours of gaming finally started to not register clicks. I took Razer as a premium gaming brand, based on price, past experience with their controllers, ect. This mouse was only passable for me. I often play mobas, so the macro keys seemed interesting as they possibly could aid gameplay. However, the thumb keys are so small you're extremely likely to hit the wrong key, the scroll wheel feels somewhat loose as a result of the added side buttons, and the overall build felt to light, very cheap (solid plastic) and a bit bulky to handle. All that put together made me opt to get another gaming mouse, which landed me with a Corsair M65 pro rgb mouse for about 5$ cheaper. This corsair is designed for FPS games, but feels a world of difference in the hand. Its brushed aluminum bottom makes it very solid, and it comes nicely weighted, as well as having removable weights. I would recommend looking into the Corsair mice before Razer.

Will I still use this mouse? Yes, on my laptop as a throw around mouse. However, my ridiculously expensive z370 desktop deserves a keyboard/mouse which are just as enjoyable as the performance the PC unleashes when I boot up.",5 year old mous 2k hour game final start regist click took razer premium game brand base price past experi control ect mous passabl often play moba macro key seem interest possibl could aid gameplay howev thumb key small your extrem like hit wrong key scroll wheel feel somewhat loo result ad side button overal build felt light cheap solid plastic bit bulki handl put togeth made opt get anoth game mous land corsair m65 pro rgb mous 5 cheaper corsair design fp game feel world differ hand brush aluminum bottom make solid come nice weight well remov weight would recommend look corsair mouse razer still use mous ye laptop throw around mous howev ridicul expens z370 desktop deserv keyboardmous enjoy perform pc unleash boot,1524268800,3

But when it comes to gaming mice, SteelSeries are the ones I go to. It's not really the feel of them that draws me to the line, but how well they work for me. Razer mice tend to be the sharpest to look at, but I like how the SteelSeries mice perform, and the Rival 600 is no exception.

The Rival has 8 built in weights that can be removed so you can make the mouse as light or as weighty as you'd like, and set the balance that works best for your style of gaming. The buttons have a nice click and feel to them and the size of the mouse fits my hand well.

56706,2534,1185,"As a launch title for the Kinect, This game was pretty decent. It's basically just 5 mini games in 1. 20,000 Leaks, River Rush, Rally Ball, Reflex Ridge and Space Pop. As you can probably tell from the artwork on the case, the game uses pre-made avatars as the characters in the game, though you're not able to use your own avatar which was somewhat disappointing. The main mode of the game is Adventure mode where you play a set number of mini games in order to get medals so that you can move on to the other levels. All of the mini games in the Adventure mode are the same, the only difference is the layout as well as the main goal. For instance, One level may have you collecting a certain number of pins while another level will require you to race through it in a set time limit. There are about 4 different difficulties in Adventure mode. Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and The Ultimate Treasure. Each difficulty is locked until you beat the previous one. Beginner is almost like a tutorial letting you get a feel for things while all of the other ones challenge your reflexes and reaction speed. I only made it past the intermediate difficulty, but this game does give you a really good workout, and it's way more fun than walking on a boring treadmill.

56709,2534,4387,"After seeing commercials for this game and how it boasted a more hack 'n' slash fun feel than a scary horror feel, I kind of took a pass on this game because I always assumed that the commercials were just making this game out to be a parody within itself. Years later, I saw this game for cheap at a local mom and pop store and decided to give it a try. I didn't really expect much from it, but it actually surprised me. Despite all of the negative reviews that popular gaming sites gave this game, I actually really enjoyed it. Though it is more of a hack 'n' slash type game than a scary horror game, there are some small jump scares and even some psychological horror elements to be had in this game, but nothing major that you would get from a Resident Evil or Silent Hill game. The story was pretty good and kept me interested. The graphics are decent for a 360 game. The environment is nicely done, and the character models aren't too bad either, although you will be seeing a lot of the same enemy types pop up throughout the entirety of the game, but that didn't bother me much. The only gripe I have about the graphics is that when playing, the main character's arms always look like they are detached from his body. Now the meat and potatoes of the game, the gameplay. A lot of people have criticized the gameplay saying that it was unresponsive. This is partially true, but only for the walking aspect of the game as the game for some reason sometimes doesn't register that your foot is placed forward in order to make the character walk. There is an auto walk feature however, but it is disabled in certain sections of the game forcing you to manually control your character's walking. Also if you want to explore the environment, you'll need to manually control the walking. Exploring the environment in this game is necessary for finding collectibles such as audio tapes and tarot cards, and for finding new weapons to use on your enemies. All other aspects of the game such as picking up weapons, opening doors, fighting and turning your character around are really responsive and work well. Note that there are some sections in the game that can be somewhat difficult such as some of the quicktime events where you'll have to run across a sinking derailed train or dodge traps. I know that the Kinect is not perfect, but it is innovative and works well enough to make this game playable. The controls do take a bit of time getting used to, but once you get used to them, you'll be slicing enemy limbs off in no time. Overall, I really enjoyed the game for what it was. It reminded me of a haunted house simulator more than it did a ""fight for your life"" type of game. The only complaint I have is that the game felt really short. If your a fan of horror games, a gorehound or if you just want a good cardio workout, then you'll probably enjoy this game.",see commerci game boast hack n slash fun feel scari horror feel kind took pas game alway assum commerci make game parodi within year later saw game cheap local mom pop store decid give tri didnt realli expect much actual surpris despit neg review popular game site gave game actual realli enjoy though hack n slash type game scari horror game small jump scare even psycholog horror element game noth major would get resid evil silent hill game stori pretti good kept interest graphic decent 360 game environ nice done charact model arent bad either although see lot enemi type pop throughout entireti game didnt bother much gripe graphic play main charact arm alway look like detach bodi meat potato game gameplay lot peopl critic gameplay say unrespons partial true walk aspect game game reason sometim doesnt regist foot place forward order make charact walk auto walk featur howev,1524268800,5

Enemy and animal AI is decent and responds rationally to Lara

Controller layout makes sense
Good range of difficulty settings

Cons:
Same weapons, same skills, same kill animations, heck even basically the same enemies as the 2013 Tomb Raider.  Feels like a DLC.
NPC voice acting is atrocious.  Also the same guy reads ALL the journal entries (spanning many cultures and characters) which is a bit jarring.
Absurdly silly plot
Jank swimming controls lead to a lot of drowning death reloads

I find overall that I can pretty much complete everything by simply sneaking around and using blink - much as I did in the first game (with some other abilities thrown in on occasion just for variety).

> Graphics have been enhanced as you would expect from the previous installment.
> There are new enhancements to abilities if you're playing as Corvo (and entirely new abilities if you're playing as Emily.)
> The world of Karnaca is brighter than the dark, gritty world of the first game.
> The levels are generally much larger than they were in the first game with lots to explore - but levels are still linear overall. This is not an open world game which would allow you to find quests and complete them at your leisure.

Personally, I enjoy the game quite a bit, but even so I'll get bored if I play it for a long time. I'll typically do a level or two at a sitting and come back later.

56771,6465,3911,"The first issue is the lack of healing items until the store unlocks via crystal gathering.  I didn't unlock the store until my characters were around level 30.  Ironically once you get the store you don't have to worry about healing items dropping minus the better ones to use for boss battles since basic berries only heal 500 hp.

Second issue would be the mages having limited actions.  They can only act once per turn.  Using an item or ultimate attack also counts idiotically.  And once you unlock their level 2 spells they can't act for 2 turns.

3rd issue would be most of the character classes are pretty useless.  Whip does garbage damage and doesn't have larger aoe like the class description says.  If whip users cost less to attack and had full screen that would make up for their weak damage.  Lancer is said to have the largest range in their class description but then whips says they have larger range than lancers so that's already a huge mistake. Lancers don't have bigger aoe than most of the classes.  I'd say it's about as big as ice mages or whips and that's it.

Fencer (dumb name since the class specializes in bulky swords and does no fencing whatsoever) has the largest aoe of the weapons classes I have seen next to grenade launcher. Increased depending on the skill and sword equipped since some skills and swords have further reach.
Wind mage seems to have the largest range of the bunch since it can suck in most enemies grouping them to the middle with their 2nd spell.  Until then they are horrible and many mid sized enemies and the mine enemies are resistant to their element.

Dungeons are copy pasted and the 2d platforming makes traversing them a huge pain when you can fall down after missing a jump or not using the dk style shooting mechanic by a sliver.

Class changing and equipment is entirely random so there are many times where my characters go without upgrading equipment for multiple dungeons.  So far only my fire mage and the main character have access to more than 1 class while most of the others don't even have access to a second class as of yet.  Skills and class changing can be randomly unlocked for active battle party members and also level if the character you learned it from has theirs leveled.",first issu lack heal item store unlock via crystal gather didnt unlock store charact around level 30 iron get store dont worri heal item drop minu better one use bos battl sinc basic berri heal 500 hp second issu would mage limit action act per turn use item ultim attack also count idiot unlock level 2 spell cant act 2 turn 3rd issu would charact class pretti useless whip garbag damag doesnt larger aoe like class descript say whip user cost le attack full screen would make weak damag lancer said largest rang class descript whip say larger rang lancer that alreadi huge mistak lancer dont bigger aoe class id say big ice mage whip that fencer dumb name sinc class special bulki sword fenc whatsoev largest aoe weapon class seen next grenad launcher increas depend skill sword equip sinc skill sword reach wind mage seem largest rang bunch sinc suck enemi group middl 2nd spell horribl mani mid size enemi mine enemi resist element dungeon copi past 2d platform make travers huge,1524441600,3

56790,5077,522,"UPDATE: I don't use it for mouse and keyboard gaming. I tried it for a while and it was simply too easy. I felt bad playing with it. It's too easy to play with, and I didn't want to have to wonder if my skill was based on it. I want to earn my victories fair and square. Now, I only use it to use my Xbox One controller on a Ps4.

First things first-- why I bought this thing, so nobody will come along and bash the heck out of me for ""cheating.""

I have a Playstation 4, an Xbox One S, and a gaming PC. I intend to fully switch to PC soon enough but right now I am sticking with Xbox and Playstation because most of my buddies play one or the other. The big question that everyone always throws out-- but isn't it cheating? Doesn't it make you better than everyone else?

The short answer-- no. I'm a very good player on Xbox. I've played Xbox my whole life and I usually get three to four golds in Overwatch during a competitive game. While some characters I played better on (for instance, Soldier 76), most of the others I didn't see any improvement in. The mouse is simply more stable than a controller. It doesn't make you better. I like it more to shoot off the first shot, but it's still kinda hard to follow someone while shooting. My tracer, for instance, is absolute garbage with the Xim4. My Widowmaker, the character everyone declares is the best ever with this, has not improved. I've just never been a good snniper, though my Hanzo is decent (not as good as my console Hanzo. I'm a Hanzo main).

Playstation is where I saw most of the improvement. I have owned three Ps4s in my life and sold all of them because of the Dualshock controller. I dunno why. It's just not my thing. It has a smaller frame than the X1 controller and seems more prone to break. I'm not fond of the way it's put together in general and I'm actually trash with it. I have Battlefield 4 for Ps4 and tried it with just using the Dualshock. I gave up after I was killed like six times without a kill of my own. Then I tried it with the Xim and got roughly a 1.0 KD. I wasn't glorious. I wasn't spectacular. I wasn't cheating. I didn't have a huge leg up on anyone. Time after time after time, I got killed by someone who was probably using a Dualshock. I just prefer it to using the Dualshock because I can play all three systems with one controller to make life easier.

SETTINGS
I went through all the online videos that Xim posts to set it all up first, but once I had a config down (it's really quite easy once you figure it out) I got to adjust everything and learn what controls that I liked. Mostly, I didn't change anything. All that I had to do was adjust sensitivity from I think 20 to 180. I am a person that enjoys high sensitivity. Brief warning-- some games will work better if you fire up the settings and change in-game settings to the highest sensitivity first. Some games like Overwatch will require you to change a variety of things first. Don't worry, it's very simple. Just follow the directions in the app and you'll be fine. I'm no very techy and I had it done in two minutes.

ERROR
Okay, there was a significant error that I came across. It. Didn't. Work. Whenever I plugged it in, it kept flashing pink/purple. Although I had loaded up the config and all the devices were showing that they were powered on, I couldn't get a signal to connect and work. Though they were on, every time I pushed a button on the keyboard or touched the mouse key, the Xim flashed pink or purple. I'm going to save you an eternity of trouble and tell you what the issue is: you're drawing too much power. For both Ps4 and Xbox One S (I can't speak for any other system), go to your console settings and turn off vibration on your controller. In Ps4, make sure to turn off the speaker and dim the light. If you do that, the power drawing will go down and your system will work perfectly!

Now, one annoyance-- it doesn't work with a microphone connected to the controller. We're going back to what we just talked about. There's just not enough juice to handle a mic as well, so you're going to need to get a USB mic and plug it into your console. Easy peasey. There is, as near as I can tell, no way to get around that.

So here's the big question of the hour-- buy it? Don't buy it? Well, I bought it because I have three different systems and I wanted to be able to play with one thing on all of them. It's doing a fantastic job for me. Most people, however, aren't going to be interested in this system for that. They want it to dominate their opponents and get a leg up on the competition. For those of you out there, ignoring the possible cheating aspect and that the Xim might be outlawed soon enough when they figure out how to detect it, you'll get a mild step up. You won't suddenly be a video game god and you won't be able to beat a seasoned controller user right off the bat. Battlefield 4 is where it's supposed to shine its brightest. I tried it. I barely got a 1.0 KD on a good game. For comparisons sake, in Overwatch, it's not unusual for me to 6 or 7 to 1 KD. I don't think anyone will be reporting me to cheating or this or that, but I have had plenty of people report me for cheating when I was just using a controller. People don't like to be beaten by a ""skill"" character like a sniper, so they'll blame it on something. I've been reported probably a couple dozen times for using aimbot or mouse and keyboard when I was just using the trusty controller.

So, who would win? If there was two of me and one person had a controller and the other had a keyboard and mouse, who would win a 1V1?

It all depends. On Overwatch, it would be a strong tossup. If I was playing Tracer, the Controller Me would win. If I was playing Soldier 76, the MC ME would win.
In Battlefield 4, if I was playing on Ps4, the keyboard version would obliterate the controller version. I'm just God-awful with the Dualshock. I haven't played on Xbox in so long that I couldn't tell you reliably which I play better with.
In Fortnite, it would be close and it certainly would be much closer than it was a week ago, but the controller version would win because of the building aspect. Aim is much easier on Fortnite but the rest of the stuff isn't too intuitive, so you're going to need to play around for a while to figure it out. I'm a decent player in it as well. I've been a John Wick (Reaper) for a while. Last night I got two solos wins in a row with my controller. When I played with MC, everything was a little bit behind. Not laggy, but I just wasn't able to think that quickly with a MC yet. You have to be able to react quickly to do anything in that game. In long expanses with long-range firefighting, the MC won out. In close-quarters battle, the controller proved better. I've given up trying to play Fortnite with a MC for now.

Beware that there are a crap ton of wires and that it's something of a pain to play with... and that I still play with it regardless. I have not seen any massive improvements in my game style in the games that I am good at already. I'm about level 600 in Overwatch and the difference is ""meh."" I'm a beautiful level 4 in Battlefield 4 and the difference is staggering, but that's mostly because I can't function with the Dualshocks.

The app works remarkably well. I expected it to be trash. Not so! It connects easily and works just peachy. You can make real-time adjustments, which is nice even though I have only changed the sensitivity and a few button bindings.

I didn't just use a mouse and keyboard because that wasn't the only reason I bought it. I also bought it to use my Xbox One controller on my PS4, and it works very well.

For clarification on what I am using to know if it is compatible, I'll include a link to everything I'm using for my setup. There's no lag whatsoever.

* Game is too big...meaning you can spend all day in the massive environment and not bump into any other players. And you spend WAY TOO MUCH MIND NUMBING TIME just trying to get from one place to the next...with no action in between other than constantly running between the map and the helm.
* The quest for treasure is way more frustrating then it should be. The maps aren't detailed enough and you can spend, literally, hours searching.
* If you do happen to run across other players you'll most likely be attacked because the other players have been running on sheer boredom (game brings the worst out of players).
* Quests take hours (collect various kinds of chickens...when you go to ""Chicken Isle"" the chicken you need isn't there)...huh?
*Customization is irrelevant. Spend $2500 on a new weapon...but it's no more powerful than the one you start with.
*Customize your boat for $70,000...but the quest you just spent an hour on netted you $600???

56844,720,4509,"The story in this game is amazing. For the first time they've made Kratos, the protagonist a sympathetic character.  The attention to detail is astounding. His hands shake during one gripping scene, his eyes are wide in panic in another. The voice acting is also amazing, with deep rich inflections that lend gravity to even the simplest of exchanges.
The script is witty and engaging.  Exposition is never clunky or annoying but slid into the inbetween places.  Lifts, boat trips, and other scenes are filled with little back and forths that completely mask the fact that the game is loading the next area.  This trick keeps you from seeing loading screens except after initial boot-up or reloading post-death.
Combat is fun, deep, rewarding and very challenging.  I had to turn it down from level 3 of 4, to 2, after getting my Spartan arse handed to me in the first real encounter.  The game is full of 'Get Gud' moments as well.  Fights that will challenge all skill levels regardless of difficulty settings.
The open world map also allows for plenty of exploration that is both rewarding and allows for the character interactions to fill the space.

I've given games glowing reviews before but this is the first time I'd HIGHLY recommend the title.  It is accessible without having to play the previous games at all, it is rich and rewarding story makes me crave more and more.

The console works great and I saved a lot of money buying used.  The Wii U is not being made anymore, so they go up in value for collectors.  The console itself doesn't have the best graphics or the most comfortable/intuitive controller, but the games are some of the best in the industry.  Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Xenoblade Chronicles X, downloadable virtual console games from NES, Super Nintendo, N64, GameCube, DS, and the ability to play any Wii game?  It's a great collection of titles for one console.  The gamepad even has a headphone jack so you can play quietly while your significant-other sleeps.

It's hard to go back to 720p graphics running at 20 frames per second (Breath of the Wild) after playing my PS4 Pro at 4K and 30+ frames per second, but the games are so much fun to play, you put up with the single drawback of the system.

The included stick IS NOT compatible with any other gate including the Sanwa GT-Y. You would have to either replace the stick (which entails drilling four standard mounting holes), or jerry-rigging your own gate. The buttons are mushy and can be replaced, but may require some sanding of the chassis holes. You cannot change the control scheme for PS2 without rewiring the buttons. I read the manual to find the PS2 control scheme, but it was incorrect. PS2 control scheme is:

L1 SQ TR R1
L2 X O R2

One things for sure, I don't get into one single game that easily. Just the simplicity of this game is what gets me. You build stuff, you destroy stuff and on top of that; you get to beat up some monsters along the way. If you run out of material to build your home or fort, you just go out and gather more material, easy as that. And while the game is kinda hard in the beginning just because you're not presented with a mallet at the beginning of the game or somewhat of a scarce source of food at times, it gets a little easier once you progress through your quests, given the fact that you get more and more recipes for useful stuff that you didn't have before.

This is the start of the most important series of video games to emerge in the past twenty years. Seriously. I cannot overstate this. Remember the days when the player was forced to adapt to the game? Remember when games didn't hold your hand for seven hours and treat you like a lost child? Remember when you couldn't adjust the difficulty in order to abate your frustrations? Remember when you weren't forced to wade through a story you don't care about? I've said enough. Here's the synopsis.
When King Allant of Boletaria awakens the Old One, the (second) most powerful demon in existence, the world outside the Nexus again becomes a killing field for demons and their transmogrified slaves. The player, a stranger to Boletaria and the fog-consumed lands surrounding it, is tasked with gathering the demon souls found throughout five different zones...But to what end? For power? For the restoration of peace? For no reason at all? It's up to you, player! It all depends on what aspects of the lore affect you the most--if, of course, you so choose to delve into the story buried beneath the gameplay.
I could go into so much more detail concerning the variations of play style, the arsenal of weapons and spells available, the sheer satisfaction of figuring out and beating a demon, the exquisite level designs and the pay-off for revisiting earlier areas...but there's too much to say. Believe the hype, expect a sharp learning curve, then get this game and get all the other Souls games--so the world might be mended.

Having played all the previous God of War games previously (multiple times each), I really didn't expect anything new or exciting here... but I was wrong.

The new God of War is absolutely stunning. The fact that the camera never breaks away - ever - over the course of the 30 hour campaign is one of the craziest things I've ever seen. I had never even imagined such a feat was possible. It simply follows along the whole ride, never pausing to load or change angles or switch to a cut scene. This is a technological marvel, but more importantly, it makes the game completely immersive. It's a thing of beauty. I'm playing on a 120"" 1080p projector screen with super sampling and boost mode enabled (PS4 Pro), and I don't think I've ever been more sucked into a game's world or characters.

57140,2322,4509,"Hello, We are N-Game Arts

God of War: Sequel/Reboot...
Is a average decent game with many things going for it... but a lot of things that makes it fall apart.
For starters God of War can easily be sum up with 3 games.
Tomb Raider = Progression/Exploration
Dark Souls = Gameplay
Last of Us = Story
Which none of these things are BAD and don't really hurt the game and seeing how it is a ""Reboot"" so changes will be there.
The problem is that there was nothing wrong with the original style for God of War and so I can't praise the game for plainly coping other games...

As well the gameplay works really well and I like how the ""BOY"" mixed into the combat very nicely as a support, but I often found my self saying ""I Can't See!"" cause the camera to close to Krato's back which landed me being hit or dying as well the ""BOY"" bumping into me or I run into him which also is a pain.
With that I got really annoyed by the ""BOY"" always talking and yelling out ""Father Watch out!"" and ""I Wish Mom Was Here"" over and over.
And on that note, none of the characters are interesting other then the Mother (Faye).
Kratos, is not interesting anymore and he's all soft and being ""sensitive"" now cause he's got a son?... He seems more one dimensional now.
The ""BOY"" is just plane annoying and a very unlikable character... He's great in gameplay, but not in the story.
All the bosses are very poorly written and barely have anything that stands out about them and as well the boss fights with them isn't the greatest.
As for the enemies you fight in the game. They don't have much to them and all feel like the same enemy and the huge lack of variety of kinds really hurts the game... With you mostly fighting 5 types ALL the time and the executions are very lacking and not as epic and goring as they once were.

A great deal of your time well be spent on the boat with the annoying ""BOY"" doing a lot of grinding for resources, which is fine.
but the side guests in the game are boring and don't give nothing to the over all experience of the game... It all feels like filler and that's not a good thing.
Top of all of that, the story is pretty boring and I found my self dragging my self to try and beat it... and when you do... it don't payoff at all.

Now I know a lot people really like this game and I'm fine with that, but I'm not one of them.
God of War: Sequel/Reboot is average decent game and you well get some joy and fun from it... but it don't live of to the original God of War games at all.
It just feels like a censored, neuter version of God of War... with the lack of Rage, Gore and Sex.

Graphics don't impress me in any game... but I agree they look great, but the game don't get points for that.
The music is a hit and miss... sometimes you hear it and love it... but then others you'll forget its even there.

God of War: Sequel/Reboot is just disappointing for me...it's not a BAD game, just not a great one.
I loved the original God of Wars and those I'll remember forever. <3

The mouse is very responsive, comparable to the wired mouse I was using before it. I don't know if this will be my everyday driver mouse, but I'll keep it on hand, always at the ready. A couple of things, make sure you read the instructions and verify the surface you are using it on. I saw more than a few complaints about it not working on metal surfaces but the box alone mentions it won't work as well on metal.

57200,256,4505,"First some housekeeping. Xbox Live Subscription required as it's an online only game. 11GB mandatory patch as of this review.

You have to have a lot of imagination and creativity for lasting appeal of this game or at least hold your attention

Love the art style, best water graphics since opening of Bioshock (1). Audio is also really good especially the environmental audio. Aside from this, the game is pretty bare bones as I'll go into the game mechanics.

There are 3 quest types:
Hunt for Treasure Chests
Fight skeletons*
Capture chickens and pigs

There's no progression in the game and no story (unless you make one up yourself). You do  quests to gain money and use the money to buy cosmetic items (no stat boosts). Bad thing is, everything is ridiculously expensive. It takes hours of grinding for one cosmetic item. In order to unlock majority of the items, you'll have to grind quests which gets boring after a while especially when the challenge is the same. Also once you complete a task, you have to sail back to the quest giver which can take up to 15mins

Skeletons are the only major enemy in the game, and they all have the same battle animations/moves. The only difference is how they look and randomized attack and HP stats. There's also The Kraken is in the game, but it randomly pops up when it wants to, when it does, taking it down is anti-climatic as it just runs away. If you dive down to try to see its whole body...well the kracken is invisible. Just random grouped tentacles floating on the waves

There are raids in the game where you team up with other people to fight hordes of skeletons for treasure

Also, there are passive challenges like opening certain amount of chests. But the challenges can take hours to complete just one artificially extending the life of the game

PvP
This is where you attack other ships and pirates online. This is the most fun and frustrating part of Sea of Thieves.

good if you have a decent team or people you know to play with you. If you don't communicate and/or teamed up with noobs you'll have a bad time as you can be decimated by the other team as your team have to micro manage everything on the ship: have a scout, people on the cannons, person steering the ship, people patching up the ship/throw buckets of water back into the sea so it doesn't sink.

When everyone know what they're doing, and coordinate/work together it's a blast (this is rare unless you have friends to play with). Thus the this part of the game is as fun as the people you are playing it with.

If you don't have online friends, it's hard for you to get a decent team. First off, most won't communicate with you, or worst yet won't accept the mission to even start the quest.

There are no rewards for PvP, just you losing you quest progress if the enemy team starts shooting at you and/or sinks your ship...

After a few hours, you feel like you're done with the game. The game gets repetitive really quickly, unless you have friends who like getting together to raid other ships and like doing repetitive grinds cosmetics. It's like the developers saw how kids can put in 100s of hours on a game like Minecraft, where the game gives you a little and have to use or imagination to extend the playtime...but instead of building, you're raiding other pirate ships and grinding for your your next belt, beard or dress.

In the end, it feels like a tech demo for water physics and animation, and to test how much people are willing to grind for a different colored gun that has the same stats as any other gun in the game. If you get bored of the repetitiveness, you can create your own fun I guess*

The great part of this game is that it utilizes ""Download & Play"" feature that not many others out there do.
Essentially, this means you can buy one copy and have 2 people (on separate 3DS/2DSXL) play it off the one cart.
The one that has it loaded opens apps, selects ""Download & Play"" and the other opens that app and enters that lobby to download the game and join the host (local network play only).
The guest can only be Shyguy and use the generic kart, but you can play all modes together.

This one offered a new entry, but left a lot to desire.

This one just seemed very rushed in production.
While the story was there, it seemed underdeveloped and the characters lacked depth.

There was a ton of back and forth for quests and lack of variety, as there are a very limited number of zones.
All of the roles seemed unimportant through the game (gets more important for bonus dungeon).
The specialties were not all that helpful either, just seemed like another way to get people to grind out SP to raise them.
Crafting was almost worthless as you could always buy better gear than you could make due to lack of the needed materials

It all seemed like it was just leading to the bonus dungeon, which is rather lame if you ask me.
The game shouldn't be a platform to reach a stagnant bonus dungeon.

While I did enjoy the game (for the most part), it left a bad taste in my mouth at the end.
Rather anti-climatic, and no real sense of accomplishment once the end was reached.

If you can get this one on the cheap, I'd pick it up to play just for completion sake.
They could have done so much better with this one. but it was a good time killer for the price I got it at.",huge fan seri ever sinc ps1 releas so2 best one imo one offer new entri left lot desir one seem rush product stori seem underdevelop charact lack depth ton back forth quest lack varieti limit number zone role seem unimport game get import bonu dungeon specialti help either seem like anoth way get peopl grind sp rais craft almost worthless could alway buy better gear could make due lack need materi seem like lead bonu dungeon rather lame ask game shouldnt platform reach stagnant bonu dungeon enjoy game part left bad tast mouth end rather anticlimat real sen accomplish end reach get one cheap id pick play complet sake could done much better one good time killer price got,1525996800,3

I love the feel of the mouse.  It is very comfortable.  Using buttons and the mouse have become 2nd nature to me.  This mouse is super sensitive.  In fact you can customize the mouse settings and set it for speed-I must admit, to look at my settings youd think it is set slow, but this thing is fast!  I never find this to lag-gamers hate lag.  The mouse pad is great, you never have to charge the mouse which is nice, and you can flip the pad to be more hard surfaced but I don't like that side as well (pure preference).

My metal computer is under the mouse on a shelf and I haven't had any interference with it either.  The connection with this mouse was a slight bit trickier to set up-I still don't know why.  But my computer wouldnt recognize it and the mouse wouldnt workmaybe a glitch.  I unplugged it again, re-plugged it back in and restarted the computer and its been fine ever since.

57402,1788,1347,"It's kinda amazing how compact this thing is compared to my other keyboard, putting it on my desk I felt a little shocked, but honestly I like it, frees up a lot of space for me to move my mouse around a bit more. As far as build quality goes this baby is as solid as they come. I was turned onto this keyboard by r/mechanicalkeyboards calling this the go to budget mechanical keyboard and so far they're right, they keybord feels nice and clicky, the build quality is solid as hell for a fraction of the price of other keyboards that cost a lot more.

Why spend $100+ when you can drop $30-$40 and get the same if not better experience? I'm going to look into replacing the keys with something more stylish for my personal preference, but all in all, the keyboard is among one of the best i've used.

57408,5640,4506,"A lot of reviews of Sea are saying that the game sucks because of the lack of substance. While I can't argue that there is a whole lot to do right now, by October that will change. Over the summer 2 or 3 large updates are releasing that will add new enemies, ships and other stuff like bug fixes. Another thing people complain about a lot. I personally have only ever experienced one bug. It's annoying but not game breaking. One of my friends I play the game with has a bugged client, so when we play our instruments, neither of us can here the other. That's the only bug I've experienced. The content that is in the game has thus far given my friends and I hours of fun. There are three alliances, and you purchase voyages from and level up in each alliance. The alliances are The Gold Hoarders, who will give you voyages of two kinds. The first is an X-marks-the-spot voyage, where you will receive one or more maps of different islands throughout the fairly sized map, (which will be expanded over the summer) and you have to navigate to the islands and find where the x's are located and dig up treasure. The treasure chests range from Castaway chests, worth around 100 gold to the Hoarders, to the more rare chests like the Chest of Sorrows, which will cry and flood your ship if you aren't careful, worth around 2000 gold. The other type of voyage is a riddle voyage, where you travel to a random island and solve various written riddles to find buried treasure. The second alliance is the Order of Souls. The Order will give you voyages in which you will have to venture to various islands and defeat skeletal pirate crews and claim the Captains' skulls. The skulls range from the Foul Bounty Skull, worth around 100 gold to the Order, to the Villainous Bounty Skull, worth around 1000 gold. The final alliance, the Merchant Alliance, are essentially the goods traders. Upon purchasing a voyage from them, you will be given a list of goods you will need to obtain and deliver to a specific outpost by a certain date. The tasks range from catching animals like various types of chickens, pigs, and snakes, each fetching a different price, to filling crates with different goods like bananas, cannonballs, or wooden planks. Beyond voyaging, there is still a lot to do. You can battle other players and their ships, or use your gold to upgrade your clothing, weapons, equipment, and ships. All of the upgrades are aesthetic, making Sea of Thieves a skill based game, which adds a fun amount of challenge to the battles and voyaging. There is no way to have an advantage over other players. You can shoot each other out of cannons, fight the kraken, and more. Overall, Sea of Thieves is a really fun game to play with your friends, (though you can play solo) and I highly recommend buying it for yourself.",lot review sea say game suck lack substanc cant argu whole lot right octob chang summer 2 3 larg updat releas add new enemi ship stuff like bug fix anoth thing peopl complain lot person ever experienc one bug annoy game break one friend play game bug client play instrument neither u that bug ive experienc content game thu far given friend hour fun three allianc purchas voyag level allianc allianc gold hoarder give voyag two kind first xmarksthespot voyag receiv one map differ island throughout fairli size map expand summer navig island find x locat dig treasur treasur chest rang castaway chest worth around 100 gold hoarder rare chest like chest sorrow cri flood ship arent care worth around 2000 gold type voyag riddl voyag travel random island solv variou written riddl find buri treasur second allianc order soul order give voyag ventur variou island defeat skelet pirat crew,1526256000,5

57456,9431,89,"GTA has been one of my favorite series since GTA III. I have had GTA V on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC. I'll start off with a bit of a negative feeling I had with it. I didn't like the idea of multiple player-characters but I believed if they could make the player-characters interact with each other, it could be very revolutionary for ... one player games. They really didn't succeed on that. I've spent countless hours on the game looking for a car that I wanted Trevor to have but won't see a single one. Then, I switch to Franklin and Michael and the first car I see is the one I wanted Trevor to have but outside of driving to Trevor, getting out and switching characters there wasn't much of a way to pull this off. To make matters worse, the other characters are rarely seen when you try to go back to where they were. This also applied to money, weapons, bullets, etc...

Besides that, this is a very fun version of GTA, my personal favorite. I thought the little stories for each character were funny, the NPCs were memorable and funny too. I still hear ""Green light, green light ...Martin Madrazo... give you green light!"" I also liked the way they had the characters of Franklin and Michael working together. Trevor is the star of the three but as with every GTA, they always go overboard with a character. Trevor should have had the most funny parts but most of his were serious and that's the other part, they made him too bitter. This is a longtime problem with GTA characters. None of the three characters were any happier at the end of the game as they were at the first of the game.

If you have played GTA games you already understand that part. A big part of the fun for me was just running around and beating up random people. See, a negative comes in, you draw the police attention way too often for the smallest things. My most hated one is still in this part. Police car turns into you while you're on a timed mission and on comes the sirens. I don't know if it was intentional but the mountain between San Andreas and Blaine County made for a perfect escape route no matter how many stars but it also meant I spent a lot of the game driving a 4WD to rush around the dirt roads.

The weapons still leave a lot to be desired. Hopefully, part 6 will rethink the way weapons are unlocked. It can be frustrating to finally get the two weapons you want with only 2 missions to do.

My last complaint is on the violence. In 2018, GTA V, is very tame. If nothing else, if they just made the violence similar to Fallout. The only reason I see this game being rated M is the language. I was also disappointed that they didn't release any story DLC.

But the graphics are very good, the pace of the game is faster than the previous part and really it's better paced than any of the GTAs since III. They also removed some of the once innovative parts that aren't just working like the dating that was required. The controls aren't as clunky as they used to be. You and I both can see the vast improvements they've made but it could be better. It's still a game every gamer over 18 should play.

I should mention the other part. GTA Online. I've never played it. I even found it a little annoying when a splash screen would pop up telling me about a new weapon in GTA Online. Most of those are available in story mode but a lot of the Online special content disappears, especially the vehicles. Then we're back to watching Youtube videos hoping to find out where to get our favorite car at. Those who have labored with GTA already know this too and I think it's why we keep doing it. Maybe if they made everything work better or more fair, it wouldn't feel like GTA?

You can easily spend 100+ hours on this game just like previous GTAs.

57499,288,4509,"God of War is the latest entry to the Sony exclusive Mythological game moving from the Gods of Greece to the Gods of Norse in the a reinvention of the franchise. After God of War Ascension mostly lukewarm response and the conclusion to the story in God of War 3. God of War is back with a soft reboot where Kratos is now in Midgard, has a new family, and with his son Atreus seeks to spread the ashes of his recently deceased wife on the highest peak in the realms. Does God of War truly live up to the hype or are the Gods dead?
Pros:
Graphics, are a free space for games nowadays but completely deserved as God of War is a great looking game. The Game nails the Norse aesthetics and Kratos and Atreus look great especially Kratos, who now sports a thick beard. The game has options on the PS4 Pro which I played it on, whether 4K at 30 or 1080p at an uncapped one the game looks gorgeous at either setting. The uncapped frame rate is inconsistent as it drops in the bigger areas but gets to 60 FPS in smaller areas, it became my favorite option to play on. All while having a one shot over the shoulder camera that never cuts away from beginning to the end, like the movie Birdman but this being a 20 hour game and not a two hour movie. Gone is the locked camera angles from previous God of War games. So whether on the Pro or regular PS4 God of War is one of the best looking games of the generation.

The Story. The plot of God of War takes a different route Kratos isn't here to take vengeance on the Norse Gods and kill everyone that plot concluded in God of War 3. Instead it tells a more personal story of Kratos spreading the ashes of his wife on top the highest point in all the realms. The Gods of Asgard meddle along the way and we have one the best told stories for God of War franchise, also a length one its about 20 hours long with 10 hours of side quests. The dynamic between Kratos and Atreus works throughout the game as we see Kratos get major character development from being this one dimensional angry guy at the Gods and anger at everyone to a more calmed and disciplined father trying to raise his son to be better than him. It was something that I didn't expect from the story or necessarily wanted but it turned out to be great for the character of Kratos. Atreus the son of Kratos is likeable, he is the kid that hopes for the best out of everyone. The dynamic of Kratos and Boy is great my favorite is the boat stories they tell each other about Norse Mythology or previous God of War games. At some point in the story you get a talking head and he joins your party. There is so much of the story thats great its my favorite out of all the God of War games. From making Kratos into a sympathetic character to the norse mythology transition to the Father and Son dynamic that works. God of War makes a new and unique story that is the best in the franchise.

The Gameplay. has been revamped from the hack and slash to a third person action game. The first impressions where this looks like the Last of Us you got an old man and a child they ruined God of War! The gameplay is pretty fun its not the Last of Us its more of an action game now you have the Leviathan axe where you can chain combos and team up with atreus as he shoots arrows. The axe also functions like Mjolnir and can be thrown and called back to you which all can be used to chain combos. You have also you fists as a weapon and although Kratos is more calm he is still prone to Spartan Rage where his attacks are more amped up. All can be upgraded with the skill tree making for a fun and enjoyable gameplay. You can also get new armor and gear throughout your journey to midgard adding some more RPG elements. It isn't going to win everyone over if you prefer the hack and slash combat this new third person might be a betrayal of the franchise. As this moves from the hack and slash to a third person action game. Despite the changes the combat it is an improvement and the changes were necessary as the combat started to grow stale by Ascension.

The soundtrack: God of War has always had a good soundtrack but the old norse OST nails the atmosphere of the game and needs to be praised.

No Microtransactions. Kind of sad that this has become a positive thing but since most triple A games have embraced microtransactions. I am happy to report that God of War has no season pass, no microtransactions, and no loot boxes. This could have easily been monetized with the games armors but it  didn't and instead of buying it you actually have to play for it. God of War is like the games back in the day what you see is what you get no paywalls, no broken at launch we will fix this later. Just a good old fashioned game and in 2018 that is saying something.

Its a linear single-player game. Yes people still want to play single-player games (cough EA cough)  as God of War is a linear single player game. It is not a live service, an open world, or an mmo. It refreshing to see a traditional single-player game in the age of live service. As publishers say single-player games are dying God of War comes out and proves them wrong with it being a critical and financial success. God of War proving a big publisher like EA is a huge positive.

Cons:
Side Missions, feel like busy work and sometimes feel like they are added to pad the length of game.

Boss Fights. Good for the most part but some boss fights are recycled. You fight the same troll four times in a row throughout your playthrough. Thats just laziness and it trying to pad out the game.

The ending sucked. Not Mass Effect 3 levels of bad, however the game just ends and sets up for the next game God of War 2 or God of War V. Theres nothing real more to say about the ending it just short. Its like opening an empty Christmas present. There is a secret ending that teases stuff coming in the next game but that doesnt save the ending from being bad.

Verdict:
God of War is the best game to come out in 2018 for now. While not perfect the series still managed to achieve the impossible. To successfully change the franchise especially as beloved as this one. There was more things against God of War than for it. Yet Cory Barlog and his team at Sony Santa Monica managed to bring back the franchise from the brink. God of War is worth absolutely playing it is fantastic renaissance for the franchise after God of War Ascension.  A Game of the Year contender.

57503,4661,1024,"Before I start this review, I need to disclose the fact that I purchased this for $18.49 using an Amazon Coupon. That being said, I will do my best to judge the product based on it's current price of $36.99.

So, I purchased this keyboard because my previous mechanical keyboard braking in less than a year after purchasing it. I wanted a product with blue-mechanical switches (Personally, the brand of the mechanical switches doesn't matter that much, as long as they feel good to type on I think it's fine) as those are my personal preference. So, I decided to give this keyboard a shot, and I think I made a wise decision.

To start off, typing on this keyboard feels great. The key caps are a bit louder than I'm used to in blue switches, however that's going to be a bigger problem for my room mate than it will for me. Even the spacebar, a button that is typically the weakest in many cheaper mechanical keyboards feels great.

As for the lighting, I was initially worried that I wasn't going to like the rainbow pattern of the keys. That being said, I actually like it quite a bit when looking at it in person. I should point out that there is no way to change the color of any key, but for this price point that isn't that surprising. But, if you don't like the rainbow pattern, there are probably better choices out there for a similar price. That being said, there are various effects that can be done with the LED keys. These effects are listed on the product page if you're curious.

There are only a couple of downsides I can think of with this keyboard.
-The rubber grips on the keyboard work well, however there are no rubber grips on the stand pieces, meaning that the keyboard can be shifted if you accidentally push it.
-There are holes on the bottom of the keyboard that are clearly there for an ergonomic wrist-rest that can be attached to the keyboard. While the page listing doesn't indicate anywhere that a wrist-rest would be included, having one would of made the product even better.

Overall, if you're looking for a good budget gaming keyboard, I think this is a pretty decent option.",start review need disclos fact purchas 1849 use amazon coupon said best judg product base current price 3699 purchas keyboard previou mechan keyboard brake le year purchas want product bluemechan switch person brand mechan switch doesnt matter much long feel good type think fine person prefer decid give keyboard shot think made wise decis start type keyboard feel great key cap bit louder im use blue switch howev that go bigger problem room mate even spacebar button typic weakest mani cheaper mechan keyboard feel great light initi worri wasnt go like rainbow pattern key said actual like quit bit look person point way chang color key price point isnt surpris dont like rainbow pattern probabl better choic similar price said variou effect done led key effect list product page your curiou coupl downsid think keyboard rubber grip keyboard work well howev,1526428800,4

57512,3773,354,"Want a simple, yet feature packed mechanical keyboard? Look no further. Now the first question you may ask, what is the different between this and the K70? At first glance, they look similar, however are there a few differences.

The K70 resembles the Razer Blackwidow X, an ""open-board"" design, with no back-plate, so the LED's just glow off the back of the frame, which may reduce the brightness but may make the colors appear more vibrant.

The Strafe however, resembles the Blackwidow Ultimate, with a ""closed board"" design, so you have the frame, a red backplate (white if you have the RGB version) and then the switch. So the Strafe has a red backplate to make the colors ""pop"" not as vibrant as the K70, but a whole lot brighter. If you have the RGB version you have a white backplate, so make all the colors pop.

Other than that, the only other major difference is the lack of media keys and volume keys, but luckily we do have a function key we can use to access these settings, just press FN and either F5 or F7-F12. Though if you want dedicated media keys, you can get the K68, which is very similar to the Strafe but has media keys and is dust and spill resistant.

Back to the review, this keyboard has a very simplistic design, which isn't bad at all. There's lots of gaming/mechanical keyboards that look like they came out of a sci-fi movie, which just goes to show companies will do anything to make a buck. This however, just looks like a premium keyboard, no weird corners or shapes, just a keyboard. Design gets an A+.

The Strafe uses Cherry MX switches, and knowing Corsair we couldn't expect less from their mechanical keyboard line up. The Red Led version of the strafe offers: Blue, Brown, Red and Silent switches. Mine has Cherry MX Blues, and for the most part the switches are implemented very well. However, I really do not like the stabilizers, as they are Cherry stabilizers. While they may be easier to work with when taking off the key caps, they don't feel as good as a Costar stabilizer, they just make the larger keys not feel mechanical, its like they bottom out right away. In fact, this is one of the reason why I'm rating this 4 stars. Switches get a B.

This keyboard is actually packed with quite a bit of features. You have:

N-Key rollover, so if you press every single key at the same time they will all register.
Full anti-ghosting, so no extra keystrokes or missed keystrokes.
FPS/MOBA keycap set, so if you want to make your WASD keys or a few other keys more easy to find, you can do that.
Key cap puller, seriously, why don't some of the higher end keyboards include this? *Cough* Razer *Cough*
USB 2.0 pass through, plug in the second USB connector into your PC and you can then use the port on the back, very convenient.
Wrist rest cutouts (Newer version of the Red Led Model)
Red Led Backlighting
Windows Lock key

Wow that's a lot of features. But, its amazing. Has features for enthusiast users and hardcore gamer's. However, here's another reason why I'm giving this 4 stars. In 2015, the Strafe RGB was introduced, and was the first Strafe to come with an included wrist rest. And at some point after that the Red led version was updated and now includes cutouts for the wrist rest. And the wrist rest from my old Strafe RGB works beautifully with it. But Corsair, why include the cutouts but not the wrist rest? You can go on Corsair's website and buy a K66/K68 wrist rest (They use the same wrist rest from the Strafe RGB) and pay an extra $10. But why do we have to do that? Features gets a B.

Build quality? What you expect from Corsair. Top notch. This keyboard isn't made of the aircraft grade aluminum like the K70. This is made of a matte-like plastic, and it feels solid. Keyboard doesn't move around when typing and its not a finger print magnet either. Key kap quality? They aren't double shot key caps, but they are decent. Build quality gets an A.

How about the lighting? Being the Red led version, you can actually create your own lighting effects via the Corsair CUE software, though your still limited to 255 shades of red, aka brightness levels. Its probably best just to keep this on the static red color. Lighting gets an A.

Finally, the software. This keyboard is compatible with the Corsair CUE software. With this software you can do anything from change what the Windows lock button does, to changing the lighting, to re-programming the entire keyboard. The limit is pretty much endless.

So, would I recommend this? YES! Amazing features, switches and build quality. Can't go wrong with this keyboard, especially considering its only $80, and its still a great keyboard, despite those 2 small gripes I have with it.",want simpl yet featur pack mechan keyboard look first question may ask differ k70 first glanc look similar howev differ k70 resembl razer blackwidow x openboard design backplat led glow back frame may reduc bright may make color appear vibrant strafe howev resembl blackwidow ultim close board design frame red backplat white rgb version switch strafe red backplat make color pop vibrant k70 whole lot brighter rgb version white backplat make color pop major differ lack medium key volum key luckili function key use access set press fn either f5 f7f12 though want dedic medium key get k68 similar strafe medium key dust spill resist back review keyboard simplist design isnt bad there lot gamingmechan keyboard look like came scifi movi goe show compani anyth make buck howev look like premium keyboard weird corner shape keyboard design get strafe use cherri mx switch know corsair couldnt expect le mechan keyboard line,1526428800,4

57567,24,3851,"wow, Just wow this new series starts off boring and poorly made
this is Everything Wrong with Spyro: A New Beginning

Pros:
Decent graphics

Decent story

Upgradeable attacks

A Super attack when your energy meter is full

Gems are no longer used as money so no more stupid pennybags

Great animations and voices ill add to

New Characters

Flying levels, minus collecting items

Good checkpoints

Some unique bosses but not enough with all the fighting you will be doing

Bosses seem to have weakness's to your elemental breaths but hard to say on normal enemies

Great levels, minus the final level

Cons:
from start to finish, 90% of the game is fighting, and fighting and more fighting of the same enemies over and over again
the enemies all have names but i couldn't care cause its all stupid monkeys and more monkeys with the only some variety in the next stage
their fur color and choice of clothes will be slightly different but its the same monkeys

some enemies like: spiders, plants and crystal giants stick with its species name, why just them?
and you will some some new enemies but again its mostly monkeys

your elemental attack is now limited and have to refill by collecting gems
and the effects are lame, lightning isn't lightning, instead its basic and generic electric
earth is a shot gun with a bonus of wind
and ice rains down sheets of icicles?

unlike the previous games where you learn your breath powers
here you just randomly get them, no joke, instead of fighting a boss
helping and releasing someone, you just earn new powers at the most convenient times like when a goatman needs saving
or when some random bolt strikes spyro... wat?
they look ok but they all sound wrong and totally incorrect sounding effects
and everytime you rescue a dragon you have to sit and watch a statue rise and lower just to do some training and this happens four or more times
do you even find out more of spyros origin and hes past life? find artifacts waiting for him to unlock said powers and/or add to the story?
NO! NOT AT ALL

sparx is a brat and a jerk almost all the time

which btw the opening and story begins with spyro thinking hes a insect like sparx and hes parents??
who the hell thought that was a good idea? isn't it pretty freaking weird for a much bigger animal to not realize hes alot different?
i mean a big difference

the names for you breathes and combos are so lame, cheesy and too long

the game has a total of nine and a half of enemies and they are:
plants and spiders which you won't see again, monkeys big and small, bulls and bats, vikings/knights with a 2nd form, rodents and crystal golems and a rock giant and some electric ball. thats it besides bosses.

whats with darkness making small characters big anyway? flipping MLP did that too

my god sparx doesnt shut up and five bigger, stronger and wiser dragons failed to do the one job they had?
and their village is surrounded by mushrooms ?",wow wow new seri start bore poorli made everyth wrong spyro new begin pro decent graphic decent stori upgrad attack super attack energi meter full gem longer use money stupid pennybag great anim voic ill add new charact fli level minu collect item good checkpoint uniqu bos enough fight bos seem weakness element breath hard say normal enemi great level minu final level con start finish 90 game fight fight fight enemi enemi name couldnt care caus stupid monkey monkey varieti next stage fur color choic cloth slightli differ monkey enemi like spider plant crystal giant stick speci name new enemi mostli monkey element attack limit refil collect gem effect lame lightn isnt lightn instead basic gener electr earth shot gun bonu wind ice rain sheet icicl unlik previou game learn breath power randomli get joke instead fight bos help releas someon earn new power conveni time like goatman need save random bolt strike spyro wat look ok sound wrong total,1526688000,2

57598,3297,3402,"You may be thinking, ""Hey, I like persona 3 and Persona 4, this sounds like the the perfect followup game!
Well the part that the amazon description leaves out is...The gameplay...

At it's core this is NOT a traditional persona game.
It's a spin-off
It's the P3 and P4 characters in a 'Persona' themed Etrian Odyssey Game.
 -------
Before I go into a long rant, Here are the THREE most important things to know before considering this game:

1- You have to draw your own map.
When exploring dungeons, unlike in p3/p4 the places you walk are not recorded, you have to manually draw them out on the touch screen.
It seems to be a core feature in this game, but I kinda find it tedious, luckily the game has an 'auto-map' feature in the settings, that will at least draw walls for you, but you still have to draw out elements like shortcuts, and other map elements

2-Paid DLC personas????
Why is this even a thing?
I though the massive amounts of costume DLC for p5 was silly, or the glasses packs for p4a, but selling high level personas for Real money is just wrong.
Sure, they have some free DLC persona's but the rest are paid.

3- It doesn't play like a persona game
Kinda the point of this long review, Aside from a brief mention 'Etrian Odyssey' on the back of the box, there is nothing to even hint at the HUGE style changes in this game.
Combat and navigation are drastically different.
Social links are removed, most weapons/armor need to be crafted, and Much More!
I'm sure I can't be the only one who was expecting more persona-like gameplay.
----

Aside from the obvious character redesigns, just about everything you'd expect to find in a persona game has been altered in some way.
And I mean EVERYTHING!
+Dungeon navigation
+Dungeon progression
+How enemies appear
+Battle UI
+Battle perspective
+Team 'formalization'
+How 'turns' are planned
+How weakness work
+How 'Knocked down' / 'all out attack' works.
+Social links
+Character persona's
+Persona evolution
+'Failure state' in battle.
+How Item shops work.
+how weapon shops work.
+world navigation
+Much more!

Now I'm *not* saying this is just a reskinned  Etrian Odyssey Game, they did do a good job of adding some persona elements,
But if you're expecting even a persona-lite experience, this is not it.

Like the other spin-offs, you have to go in expecting a different game style,
And thankfully, the writing is quite a bit better than the other p3/p4 spin-offs,
But they still fall into some of the same traps of just reducing some characters to a running joke.
""Chie like meat, right?  Ok so let's reference that every chance we get!""
>Even in battle sir?
""Sure Why not!""

It never really reaches 'parody' level, but it can get a little annoying.

The combat changes are really what bothered me,
As shown above, just about every aspect is changed,
You'll have all the same skills as most persona games,
But walking around on a first person grid, and getting throwing into random battle, feels really dated.
I know the Etrian Odyssey games still do it, but persona hasn't had that since the first entry on the ps1.

The battles are also in first person, it's fairly easy to get used to,
And I kinda like having more than four people in my party, and having the healers and buff/debuffs in the back to take less damage.
The fact that your main party member's death does not end the game is kinda nice, but it still feels a bit weird.

All out attacks and co-op moves are now charged with a bar, rather than based on knockdown status, this can make some battles a bit longer.

the dungeons are MUCH shorter this time around, but each floor is much more complex, so it balances out and keeps the game from feeling too short.

But overall, I feel I would have liked this game much more if the gameplay was much more persona,
Or at least if the marketing did a better job of showing just how prevalent the Etrian elements were.

If you like  Etrian style games, and persona, you'll probably love this,
But I'd never even heard of Etrian Odyssey before picking this up,
And this game doesn't really make me want to play them, I'm not a fan of this style of dungeon crawler.

I Don't hate Persona Q, it's by far the best spin-off, in many area's,
But it's just missing a lot of the things I love about persona,

I love seeing the p3/p4 characters again, but I just could not (personally) enjoy the gameplay as much as I'd like.",may think hey like persona 3 persona 4 sound like perfect followup game well part amazon descript leav isth gameplay core tradit persona game spinoff p3 p4 charact persona theme etrian odyssey game go long rant three import thing know consid game 1 draw map explor dungeon unlik p3p4 place walk record manual draw touch screen seem core featur game kinda find tediou luckili game automap featur set least draw wall still draw element like shortcut map element 2paid dlc persona even thing though massiv amount costum dlc p5 silli glass pack p4a sell high level persona real money wrong sure free dlc persona rest paid 3 doesnt play like persona game kinda point long review asid brief mention etrian odyssey back box noth even hint huge style chang game combat navig drastic differ social link remov weaponsarmor need craft much im sure cant one expect personalik gameplay asid obviou charact redesign everyth youd expect find persona game,1526860800,3

Example: All of a sudden after never landing on your properties they will land on them if they don't have to pay because you are in jail (with the auction only setting and no rents in jail).
Not AI issues but some programming stupidity examples:  Dice constantly (almost every roll) hit things on the table thus changing the outcome of the roll.  The dice should be rolled in sight (many times they are out of sight) and away from board pieces or they should make board pieces invisible.  Alternate game rules can not be combined.  AI token pieces can not be chosen.  Game can not be set with defaults so every time you play you have to reset every little thing.  There are more but you get the point.  Too bad about these issues because this could have been the only decent game in this set.

57620,8338,4509,"I'm only maybe halfway through the game, if that, but I haven't had any issues so far. The game is very well designed, and a joy to play; the story is compelling, and original, immersive, and unintrusive. This game innovates, but still feels like God of War; And Atreyu hasn't once proven a hindrance so far (you can tell the dev team put a lot of thought into designing this game).

I'd like to note that while the axe is the only weapon that kratos can wield (I think; which is new, as Kratos would usually obtain multiple weapons in previous titles), said axe and Kratos' and Atreyu's gear and skills are so heavily upgradeable and customizeable, and the axe's mechanics are so polished, that I don't expect that many people will be bothered.

As a fan of the GOW series, I did initially feel somewhat disappointed when I started the game and immediately realized that some version of the blades of chaos wouldn't play a role in this game; but there's a really nice nod to their importance in the series (and their significance to Kratos) in one of the first scenes (it may actually be the first scene, watch the bandages on Kratos' arms, you really can't miss it unless you're not paying attention); and once you get into the game, you won't miss them for long; as the axe is really fun to use once you're accustomed to it.

You can't jump in this game, which feels slightly off at first; but it's easy to understand why once you've got a grasp on the differences between this game and older titles. Another thing that you won't miss for long.

I knocked off one star because the game is a linear/open world hybrid in design; which in itself is fine, but it' can be somewhat difficult to find your way around, and there are several locations and items in the game which can't be accessed until progressing in the game; which means that the player will need to backtrack a lot; which is made somewhat inconvenient due to the only partially open world design. This seems to be addressed later in the game though, as the fast travel system gets upgraded over the course of the game (you can return to specific locations via magic doorways scattered throughout ""the realms"").

Also, boats could be a bit faster in open water and could steer a bit more smoothly.

Honestly, the few issues I've brought up here are nitpicks; God of War has never really been an open world series. It's only difficult to navigate because the world is full of twists and turns and detours by design; because GOW games have always been designed this way (mazelike, full of puzzles, that's a huge part of the appeal); and that's something that's difficult to translate into an open world. The Dev team has honestly done an amazing job balancing the history and expectations of the series with the new direction this entry takes.

9.7/10

update: so, fast travel does become available late in the game; and most of the items and areas in the game not directly related to the central plot seem to have been added for replayability; to extend the game beyond the story, instead of as a compliment to the story; so it's mostly just extra, post-game content.

Navigation also becomes easier when you realize that everything is accessible from the big lake in the center of the map.

There's one other thing I was wrong about but I don't want to spoil the plot so I'll keep it to myself.

The story is deeper and more developed in my opinion than in those games, and will really leave you with an urge to look up YouTube videos to learn even more about it. Combat is much more fast paced than in the Souls games, but I had no issue with it after having completed Dark Souls 3. I could understand though how people would have a difficult time with some of the bosses and enemies if they haven't played a Souls game before, or only played Dark Souls 1.

The ZL/ZR buttons are too recessed so your finger will hit the gamepad shell before the button is fully depressed. There's too much vertical travel compared to the GameCube pad.

Likewise the left analog stick is raised significantly higher than any of the other controls on the face of the pad. To move from the D-pad to the left analog stick you have to lift your thumb up a much higher distance than you did on the GameCube pad, where switching between the two was easy. Sounds minor but in practice it's irritating.

Overall this pad isn't terrible, and it works, but it's not as comfortable and ergonomic as the GameCube controller. It's easy to recommend as a cheap spare if your Classic Controller breaks someday, but it wouldn't be my main go-to controller unless I had no other options.

Best purchase I ever made! They also came with little silicone ones for the joysticks and those are really good for when you really gotta use the toggle. Very comfortable play and it fits perfectly onto the controller and you get to choose from the available colors they have.

A sidenote: Upon first use, the silicone is going to feel powdery and dry but don't worry, though. It'll go away after constant use and probably from the sweat in your palms.

57782,742,78,"This is my favorite mouse on the market for overall comfort and reliability. I got about three years out of my last one, with more than a lot of use. They definitely outlast their mediocre warranty, but this model has been upgraded with a better DPI sensor since my last Sabre.

The new LEDs are amazing, they can all be turned off, and Corsair's CUE software does everything you want it to in regards to functionality. There are not a ton of buttons on this mouse obviously, so if you need more you can step up to a different model in the current family. Still, it has enough buttons for all my gaming needs.

I remember when 5 years ago mice had horrible grips, shiny plastic, and in general didn't last over a year. This one has superb grip that wears slowly, and the overall shape fits my hand well. If it had better switches for clicking it would be an unbeatable mouse, but I guess they have to make money somewhere. You can find this one for about 40, and for three years of work to me that is fair.

Macros, lighting, DPI, et cetera. It's all here in a lighter mouse that slides easily on my leather pad and is beautifully designed with the amazing new Corsair logo, which is tasteful and professional. You can also dim it out if you don't want the LED on of course. I mostly use a completely black mouse.

Installation of CUE software is easy. You are up and running within minutes. Any number of combinations of colors and styles is available. Myriad ways to set up your buttons and layouts. I find all of the buttons perfectly placed for my somewhat larger hands, though, I do wish the side thumb location was slightly further back. You can actually play a fair amount of games that require multi-button mouse capability, so only the most hardcore gamers will need something more complex. Programming macros is simple and intuitive, and between the thumb buttons, profile button, and the top pointer buttons you should have enough to get through most games.

This Corsair mouse gets my highest recommendation.",favorit mous market overal comfort reliabl got three year last one lot use definit outlast mediocr warranti model upgrad better dpi sensor sinc last sabr new led amaz turn corsair cue softwar everyth want regard function ton button mous obvious need step differ model current famili still enough button game need rememb 5 year ago mouse horribl grip shini plastic gener didnt last year one superb grip wear slowli overal shape fit hand well better switch click would unbeat mous guess make money somewher find one 40 three year work fair macro light dpi et cetera lighter mous slide easili leather pad beauti design amaz new corsair logo tast profession also dim dont want led cours mostli use complet black mous instal cue softwar easi run within minut number combin color style avail myriad way set button layout find button perfectli place somewhat larger hand though wish side thumb locat,1527379200,5

The controller in the picture looks very well made. It's flat black and the material looks comparable to the best Sony controllers out there. Not at all representative of what you'll receive and they shouldn't be allowed to use that picture. What you'll get is glossy, cheap plastic that weighs so close to nothing at all that it might confuse you at first. I'd honestly like to see whats inside it because I'd bet it's hilarious. There's no mic plug for a headset. There's no vibration. It's wired. The triggers are very shallow and have to be pressed hard to work. This might be the worst controller I've ever seen. And that's okay BUT $50? It shouldn't be a penny more than $10 and after seeing the thing, you'd most likely want your $10 back. The regular Sony controller is MASSIVELY better than this.

57816,4142,4509,"Overall it's a great game, but boy oh boy do I have grievances.

First, the game uses a new leveling system similar to role-playing games. Enemies who are a much higher level than you (8 is the max), are displayed with purple life bars and the ability to kill you with one hit. It is as cheap and as frustrating as it sounds. Call me crazy but when I'm playing a 3rd person action title like GOW, I'd like to know I lost due to my own ineptitude, not because the enemy had a bigger number.

Second, traversing the game world is a lesson in tedium, so much so that I wondered if Kratos was the God of War or the God of Backtracking. Most of the special areas or items you find are locked off by some kind of obstacle like red goo or vines or water or something, meaning you can only access them with special skills you unlock later. This wouldn't be a problem if I didn't spend ages rowing or walking to these places with a rather unhelpful map, no means of fast travel and no indication that I'm wasting my time and probably shouldn't bother till end game.

Then there's the lack of variety in enemy types. In past games you fought cyclops, minotaurs, centaurs, man-elephants, madusa-snake-women, bat-things, sea serpents, gods, titans, hell hounds, you name it. In this game however, you fight humanoids, wolves, flying eye balls and a dragon. I don't know if this limitation is due to the Norse setting, but it makes for fairly uninteresting enemy encounters.

Finally, increasing your level requires you to upgrade your armor with hard to find resources that cannot be farmed. This results in you playing most of the game under-powered because you're too afraid to experiment with current gear in-case you find better later. Some of the best armors can only be acquired at the end of the game when you no longer need them. I'm not sure what the point is especially with no New Game Plus mode.

Nevertheless, God of War is still a great game. The story is a little anti-climatic, the combat is a little clunky, the boy is annoying as hell and there are no more boobs...sigh. Still I highly recommend picking this game up.",overal great game boy oh boy grievanc first game use new level system similar roleplay game enemi much higher level 8 max display purpl life bar abil kill one hit cheap frustrat sound call crazi im play 3rd person action titl like gow id like know lost due ineptitud enemi bigger number second travers game world lesson tedium much wonder krato god war god backtrack special area item find lock kind obstacl like red goo vine water someth mean access special skill unlock later wouldnt problem didnt spend age row walk place rather unhelp map mean fast travel indic im wast time probabl shouldnt bother till end game there lack varieti enemi type past game fought cyclop minotaur centaur maneleph madusasnakewomen batth sea serpent god titan hell hound name game howev fight humanoid wolv fli eye ball dragon dont know limit due nors set make fairli uninterest enemi encount final increas level requir upgrad armor hard find resourc cannot farm result play game underpow your afraid,1527465600,4

The game has a heavy emphasis on movement. You're really meant to be running and jumping through the environment at all times and because you'll face hoards of the undead between point A and B, you'll be spending a good amount of time jumping across rooftops, vehicles, walls and other obstacles. The game styles itself as a ""parkour"" game however, you won't be doing many of the truly fancy moves that I think of when I think of parkour (jumping from wall to wall in an alley, hitting and rolling, etc). It's much more basic running and jumping.

57851,9068,283,"Now, much like the other Soulsborne titles, there is no right way to play this game. However (and this is aimed at you, grumpy one-star-raters), there is a way to play it so that it's much, much easier...The trick is to not give up within the first hour. But anyway. Very minor spoilers here for those who care about the hidden story.
Nothing is ever as it seems in Yharnam. You arrive in the city and undergo a strange blood transfusion...When you wake, it appears the whole city is infested by werewolves and blood-crazed hunters. But, as you eventually discover, this isn't even half the issue. As you dig deeper and deeper, you find out that the various factions within and without Yharnam are misguidedly constructing the eldritch horrors that now dwell throughout the land: mad ghosts, mutated humanoids, alien abominations...And all of it can be traced to an ancient being discovered beneath the earth. Effectively, this game covers nearly every single sub-genre of horror from gothic suspense to grimdark to Lovecraftian fantasy. Furthermore, the story features one of the most vicious commentaries on religious (and anti-religious) fanaticism I've ever seen in a video game.
If you're a fan of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, there is a chance you'll love this game; but, if you love those games for their pacing and style of play, there's also a chance you won't love this game. Here, the player is encouraged to be quick and often aggressive, instead of calculated and careful. There are also less options for garb and weaponry, but each weapon has an alternative mode that often changes its attacks drastically--for example, the threaded cane is a shortsword that switches into a whip. This latter feature might be the best part of the game.
In short, read the item descriptions for hints, test out every weapon you pick up, always retrace your steps, and don't ever lose confidence. And fear the old blood.",much like soulsborn titl right way play game howev aim grumpi onestarrat way play much much easierth trick give within first hour anyway minor spoiler care hidden stori noth ever seem yharnam arriv citi undergo strang blood transfusionwhen wake appear whole citi infest werewolv bloodcraz hunter eventu discov isnt even half issu dig deeper deeper find variou faction within without yharnam misguidedli construct eldritch horror dwell throughout land mad ghost mutat humanoid alien abominationsand trace ancient discov beneath earth effect game cover nearli everi singl subgenr horror gothic suspens grimdark lovecraftian fantasi furthermor stori featur one viciou commentari religi antireligi fanatic ive ever seen video game your fan dark soul demon soul chanc youll love game love game pace style play there also chanc wont love game player encourag quick often aggress instead calcul care also le option garb weaponri weapon altern mode often chang attack drasticallyfor exampl thread cane shortsword switch whip latter featur might best part game short read,1527638400,5

57865,1507,1183,"I just purchased a model ""New Nintendo 3DS XL"" for myself and the first thing I did to protect my electronics was to buy a protective hard shell for the 3DS and a case to store the 3DS, games, and charger.  What attracted me to this Brendo case was that it is large enough to fit the 3DS with a case on it, unlike smaller, more snug carrying cases.  It can hold a whopping 24 game cartridges plus one in the 3DS for a total of 25 games you can have on hand.  There is plenty of room for the charger, stylus, and a screen cloth in the zipper pocket.  The hard shell protects everything very well, even if you drop it.  Don't overlook the free stylus either!  I am currently playing Zelda Spirit Tracks which requires you to hold a stylus the entire time.  The standard stylus is tiny and uncomfortable to play with for an extended period of time.  The stylus included in the Brendo package is much thicker, longer, and more comfortable to hold.  You need this stylus is you are playing any game that requires you to use a stylus!

I am very satisfied with my purchase and didn't find any flaws with the product.  5/5 stars.

57867,4079,4509,"An excellent game, beyond a shadow of the doubt, but people are bandying the words ""masterpiece"" and ""perfect"" and it is neither of those things.
On the pro side the combat is out of this world, so much fun and requires a lot of skill. The NPCs are tremendous in this game, with sharp, colorful personalities. Unfortunately, when all is said and done, the game is just too short.

57874,1507,4126,"The first thing I did when I bought a new Nintendo model New 3DS XL was to search for a hard shell for it.  My favorite color is black, so I wanted a black case.  Also, I didn't want to pay too much, and the TNP case was appropriately-priced at $12.  It was easy to get onto my New 3DS XL, and it is a snug fit.  It adds a slight amount of bulk to the package, but that just makes it easier to hold for larger hands.  Everything you need is easily accessible, such as the 3D slider, volume slider, and stylus.  In fact, I was new to the 3DS and had a difficult time finding the stylus without the case.  It is flush with the outside of the 3DS, so I had to flip it over and look to find where the stylus was located.  With this case, it is easy to feel for where the stylus is because there is a gap in the clamshell, so that is a pretty big plus for me.  The cameras are also uncovered, so you won't have any problems taking pictures.

The only flaw I found with this product is that it does not cover the back of the 3DS in any way.  If you drop your 3DS on any of the other sides, the case will do a good job of protecting it I believe, but if it hits the hinge side, it has no protection.  Due to the way the 3DS is made, I don't see any way to offer protection to this vulnerable hinge, so I'm not subtracting a star for the vulnerability.  Using this case is still better than not using any case at all, it's just not perfect protection like an Otterbox Defender phone case would be for example.  Still, I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the black aesthetic like I do.  5/5 stars.

57894,5703,4477,"These are very comfortable, and they feel very durable and high quality. I wasn't very impressed with the amp though. It didn't work, plugging directly into the playstation via USB. It would light up, but none of the buttons would work. If you plug directly into the controller, it works better, but lose the amp and easy controls that come with it, which means you have to mess around in the playstation audio settings anytime you want to mute your mic or adjust the volume levels. You could just unplug your mic from the headset; that would be the easiest way to mute with plugging in directly into the ps4 controller. There was a delay with my mic audio when adjusting the settings on my ps4. I haven't experienced that with other headphones. The amp also didn't work with my xbox one. What does it work on?? Also, the mic monitoring on the ps4 wasn't very clear. Mic monitoring is a huge deal to me that many manufacturers don't advertise, or get right. If you can't hear yourself talk, then how do you know if other people are hearing you right?? We've all played games with people where you can hear literally everything going on in the background at their homes; the dog barking, their mom yelling at them, music playing. That's usually because they have no idea what their mic is picking up. Or they talk waay too quietly in their mic, and you always have to tell them you can't hear them. OR, the person that is so LOUD they could be eating their microphone for all you know. Good mic monitoring on people's headphones would solve so many problems! Anyways, these are super comfortable, and the sound quality is warm and great due to the larger mm drivers. I was just bummed mainly that the amp didn't work on my xbox or ps4. You have no external controls if you plug directly into the controller. And if you move your xbox controller, there's all this analog feedback from the 3.5 mm jack that comes across in your friend's games. No thanks, I'll continue my search. So far, wired usb Turtle Beach headphones have been the absolute best I've had on xbox and ps4. The mic monitoring was amazing too.

I've used Squid Grips on my PS3 controllers, and the Kontrol Freeks (KF) feel better in quality--in regards to it's nice rubberized feel and texture. I had to apply the grips twice on my PS4 controller, because the instructions weren't very clear on where I should begin installation. Unlike other grips I've used, the KF grips don't seamlessly wrap around the controller handles; This doesn't seem to be a problem for me, but I liked that Squid Grips fit so well though. I can already feel the major difference the KF grips makes while gaming, and I like how it feels.

 Something to consider before using these, the grips will add some slight thickness around the handles. Because of this I'm no longer able to use my Collective Minds Strike Pack, or place my controller on my Controller Gear stand. I'm glad that I can still charge it in my PS4 charger at least. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I'm not certain that I'm going to wrap my other PS4 controllers if I can't use some of my accessories.

57931,3446,4506,"I have been excited about this game since about 2 years ago when I heard about it and have eagerly been awaiting its release.  I do not regret buying it, and find that I play it every chance I get.  It is incredibly addicting, but it does have some significant pros and cons you need to be aware of prior to buying this.

This is an open world, real time massive multiplayer game.  There are no rules that need be to be followed and no story line that you need to stick to.  Every ship on the horizon is a team of real players sailing the seas.  What helps make this game so enjoyable is the constant paranoia it seems to foster.  Sailing to and from different islands means you need to constantly be doing 360-degree surveillance to watch for any other ships that may be coming for you.  When you are on an island doing a voyage (like trying to find a treasure chest or collecting animals to sell), seeing a ship on the other side of the island makes your heart beat faster and faster.  When you are trying to head to the Outpost to cash in your hard-earned loot, seeing a ship already docked there makes you wonder if they can be trusted or if you should sail further to a different outpost so you can offload your goods in peace. I have spent countless hours playing this game, and it is incredibly addicting.  It is not uncommon for, on the weekends, to wake up at 4 in the morning, hop on the game, and play straight through until dinner time, rarely getting up to eat or use the bathroom.  This game is THAT addicting.  No story.  No rules. This means that what happens in the game is largely determined on how you react to every situation.  You have a couple treasure chests on board, do you head to sell your goods or gamble on doing another voyage and risking another player attacking you?  A ship passes you in the open sea, do you immediately open fire and engage in a full-out naval battle or hold your fire to see if they are just passing by and minding their own business?  This game will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

However, as much as I love this game, it has some obvious flaws.  The voyages are very repetitive.  Either you are digging up treasure chests, killing skeletons, or catching animals.  That's it.  There are some random things like diving into shipwrecks in search of loot but mainly those are your options.  There are no levels, but you gain experience which increases your reputation in whatever type of voyage you.  This reputation means nothing, however, as there is nothing to level up or higher levels do not necessarily earn you better loot.  All item and ship ""upgrades"" are strictly cosmetic.  So replay-ability in this game is somewhat questionable.  It also claims to foster a sense of teamwork among other players, but really this game is somewhat toxic as players will often claim to be friendly to accomplish a common objective, only to then turn on one another.  So deceit and sneak-attacks are common place and to be expected.  Many will claim that this is game is ""called Sea Of Thieves and not Sea Of Friends"" as the reason for this, when really this game fosters a sense of how much of a jerk players can be.  Another big downfall is there is no tutorial upon starting the game (the first hour or so you will be incredibly confused and completely unsure what you are supposed to be doing) and there is no single player option.  Sure you can opt to play on a boat yourself, but it is borderline impossible to actually be successful as you are at the mercy of bigger ships and full crews who will take advantage of you and steamroll you to take your chests.

While it sounds like there are more negatives to this game then positives, it is still a very enjoyable game, although it can be frustrating as well to have treasure on your ship only to be sunk and have the last hour or so of your time completely wasted.  As I am writing this, I am actually wondering myself why I like this game.  I think it is the thirst for adventure and paranoia this game features, and the unpredictability of it is what makes it exciting.  One final note, this game is much more fun if you actually have friends to play with.  Otherwise, trying to match up with random players is hit-or-miss.  You might get an experienced player to help fend off naval attacks or know how to do the voyages.  You also might match with someone who never played the game before and has no clue what to do and will sail your ship away while you are on a island.",excit game sinc 2 year ago heard eagerli await releas regret buy find play everi chanc get incred addict signific pro con need awar prior buy open world real time massiv multiplay game rule need follow stori line need stick everi ship horizon team real player sail sea help make game enjoy constant paranoia seem foster sail differ island mean need constantli 360degre surveil watch ship may come island voyag like tri find treasur chest collect anim sell see ship side island make heart beat faster faster tri head outpost cash hardearn loot see ship alreadi dock make wonder trust sail differ outpost offload good peac spent countless hour play game incred addict uncommon weekend wake 4 morn hop game play straight dinner time rare get eat use bathroom game addict stori rule mean happen game,1528070400,4

57937,2445,4509,"Hello friends and lovers! This is going to be short. I just finished the main story but there is some interesting endgame content left to do.
The awesome:
I really enjoyed the gameplay and the story actually made me laugh in points with the character interactions! Very well done.
I took many screen shots while playing and have them as Screensavers and some I made into postcards to send to people :) So that's my way of saying the graphics and art direction is simply amazing! Seriously this game is a joy to play and even watch.
The combat is fun and satisfying with the flying Axe being a unique addition. The upgrading is simple as the story progresses.

The not so awesome:
This is my only gripes with the game I had. First is the controls take a while to get used to but after muscle memory kicks in you'll be surprised at what you can pull off.

57972,8443,4336,"Honestly, when it has came down to the Nintendo Switch, it has really changed the way that we play video games: wherever and however we use the controls to beat the odds and climb our way to the top. But nevertheless, it isn't just about finding the right video games like Super Mario Odyssey, it is about finding the right accessories to play with the hybrid console. There have been so many for playing the system as a handheld, or a home console. But others are seeking those for those in-between that want to just play with one system, with multiple players. That is where this accessory comes in. This HORI Compact Play-stand, works nicely is you want to connect the Switch, and use both joy-cons or multiple controllers, playing your favorite games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in a compact setting, without having it in a handheld mode, or connecting it to the TV. While it may be a good buy, there are those who may consider passing this up, because it isn't as widely considered as a need for the Switch. But I recommend this for anyone that has the Nintendo Switch, and wants to play with others while they are away from home, or just doesn't want it in the handheld mode.

I thought spending more money would make a difference (as this has it's own driver on board) but it hasn't. Still have re-connect issues after successfully pairing it initially on 3 computers as a test of it's reliability and it can be frustrating to deal with.

I spent just a teeny bit more time with Aventree's product, and have greatly improved performance. I just love the on-board driver. makes it much easier. I still have difficulty connecting, but now as I spent more time with the aventree product, it is strictly the blue-tooth platform that only occasionally gives me a problem.

58000,9431,4077,"Some of my fondest gaming memories are of Final Fantasy. Here's a few highlights I still remember:
Summer of 1989, a friend bought me a Gameboy for my birthday, I returned it to Hills department store and used the store credit to buy an unheard of game called Final Fantasy on the NES. I played the game that whole summer and even took my NES on vacation with my parents (I was 13 or so).
1996-2000, my mom and I raised my younger cousin (she was 4-7 years old). She would lay on my bed and watch me play Final Fantasy 7, 8 and 9. The emotions of those games seemed kind of silly to me but she would be so wrapped up in the stories and character relationships. I even remember picking her up at school one day and her saying, ""Are you going to go look for Rinoa tonight?""
But, starting with Final Fantasy X, I kind of lost interest in the series. I did play all of them but none really made me feel like the old ones did. I didn't like how the characters in this one (XV) look or act but I won't try to sound ""too cool"" and say this is a bad game. It's quite good and fairly unique for a Final Fantasy game. The combat did take some getting used to but within an hour it was like second nature. I was surprised that the game didn't last longer. I finished it in 76 hours. That's certainly not a short game but I think maybe the older ones seemed longer because I would only play for a few hours at a time. I'll keep an eye on future releases and hope they continue the progression they've started with this one.",fondest game memori final fantasi here highlight still rememb summer 1989 friend bought gameboy birthday return hill depart store use store credit buy unheard game call final fantasi ne play game whole summer even took ne vacat parent 13 19962000 mom rais younger cousin 47 year old would lay bed watch play final fantasi 7 8 9 emot game seem kind silli would wrap stori charact relationship even rememb pick school one day say go go look rinoa tonight start final fantasi x kind lost interest seri play none realli made feel like old one didnt like charact one xv look act wont tri sound cool say bad game quit good fairli uniqu final fantasi game combat take get use within hour like second natur surpris game didnt last longer finish 76 hour that certainli short game think mayb older one seem longer would play hour time ill keep eye futur releas hope continu progress theyv start one,1528329600,4

Pros: Great to look at, fun to play, forgiving of mistakes (usually), very customizable, very cool story.

Cons: Sometimes the camera levels out when you don't want it to. The camera settings needed changing for me to play the way I wanted (See pros).

Other: The story is presented in several ways I wasn't expecting, which was wonderful. I don't want to say too much about this.

I can't imagine how bad my system would look today if I didn't have this protective case on it.  There are scratches and scrapes on the protective case now that would really bum me out if they were on the system itself.  It snaps on easily and stays snug with the system, doesn't add much in the way of bulk, and gives you easy access to all the ports.  In fact, makes it really easy to find the power button just by feeling alone.

58079,3773,4477,"This is a GREAT headset. The sound is good, the mic is decent, and the build quality is amazing. Not to mention, its feature packed.

At a glance, these look like your typical gaming headset. However, the whole thing is made of metal and aluminum, with leather stitching. Its very comfortable, and can take a beating, that's for sure. And since its made of metal/aluminum, you can wipe off any dirt with ease.

The sound is amazing. 53mm drivers, with stereo audio. However, you can toggle between stereo mode and 7.1 surround sound via the USB Sound card, and the 7.1 surround sound is emulated, so it doesn't sound that great, but it works. The bass is very good, and the lows and highs are crisp.

The mic quality? Its okay. It definitely screams ""Gaming headset"" but its clear and sounds decent, while being on the quiet side, so you may have to tinker with it when you first get the headset. Overall, sound and build quality get an A+.

Now, I mentioned this headset has quite a bit of features, and boy does it. In the box you get:

The headphones
USB Sound card
Detachable mic
A set of velour ear cushions
Airplane Adapter
Mesh carrying bag

And the headset does feature 7.1 virtual surround sound, it doesn't sound that great because it is emulated, but it does work, and works very well. This headset also does NOT have sidetone/mic monitoring, which is a let down for some people, but for me that's perfect, I find sidetone more annoying then useful.

Now, here's the big flaw. You get a set of velour ear cushions in the box, to replace the leather ear cushions if you wish. However, swapping these ear cushions is a PAIN IN THE BUTT. I spent nearly an hour just trying to get one ear cushion swapped. Its very frustrating, and you pay $100 for this headset, why is it this difficult? I've swapped ear cushions on $30 headsets with ease, this is the biggest and only flaw with this headset.

I highly recommend this headset, what I DON'T recommend is swapping the ear cushions... good lord.",great headset sound good mic decent build qualiti amaz mention featur pack glanc look like typic game headset howev whole thing made metal aluminum leather stitch comfort take beat that sure sinc made metalaluminum wipe dirt ea sound amaz 53mm driver stereo audio howev toggl stereo mode 71 surround sound via usb sound card 71 surround sound emul doesnt sound great work bass good low high crisp mic qualiti okay definit scream game headset clear sound decent quiet side may tinker first get headset overal sound build qualiti get mention headset quit bit featur boy box get headphon usb sound card detach mic set velour ear cushion airplan adapt mesh carri bag headset featur 71 virtual surround sound doesnt sound great emul work work well headset also sidetonem monitor let peopl that perfect find sideton annoy use here big flaw get set velour ear cushion box replac leather ear cushion wish howev swap ear cushion pain butt spent,1528675200,4

58165,5065,2383,"Im actually surprised at the amount of poor reviews this charging dock has. Dont get me wrong, this isn't anything particularly special but it seems to work well with a decent design.

The thing I read a lot was that the micro usb plug adapter for the controller falls out and become lost due to its size. While I haven't used mine for very long, the adapter doesnt get in the way, doesnt get loose, and doesnt add much bulk. Now maybe some people got defective pieces that are too loose but mine plugs in firmly and stays on pretty well. I typically wouldnt like something like this where I would have to plug something in but it makes charging on the dock very simple and I don't mind it.

The base itself doesnt give a lot of confidence. I think along with the fact that the top is springy so you can have the option to have it charge your controller or just act as a stand, the plastic feels cheap and flimsy. It seems to be of reasonable quality and should hold up with average care but I can see why people would be disappointed. If it had the sturdier plastic and texture of the DualShock 4 I would get a better impression from this charger.

In the end it works for me and it works as a stand or charger and or both. While the spring feature adds an element of cheap and flimsy to the dock, it is functional. While I didn't exactly give this a glowing review I can still give it 4 stars because it is priced about right for what it is. If it was just a few dollars more this would be a 3 Star and barely a recommendation. However, this works so far, it is functional as a stand and charger, and it is priced right so I can still recommend it.

58173,648,4509,"I pre ordered the Stone Mason collectors edition, so its safe to say I had high expectation for this game (feel free to look up the price of the Stone Mason Edition). To whom much is given, much is expected. For you youngsters out there, this means I spent A LOT of money on this game, so I expected nothing less than a 5 star experience. The game started off ok, but I was never really able to get immersed in it (like Horizon Zero Dawn, for example). I was one of the people who was looking forward to the change in the formula, but little did I know it would leave me with an empty feeling. Ive played and reviewed every God of War game, and the one thing they all had in common was I left feeling like I had an epic experience. This latest iteration was anything but epic. Here are 8 things that really got my attention.

[1] Anyone who knows me should know that I love games that give you an A.I. partner. Im a loner in my day to day life, so its kind of cool to have an A.I. partner to feel the role of a human companion playing the game with you. For that reason, I was initially excited about The Boy, until I played the game and realized how annoying he was. Even though he got on my nerves, he was pretty useful in combat (more on that later). Annoying or not, Kratos talked to him like he was nothing. Ill be damned if my father talked to me in that manner! I just fell off a bridge and severed my spine - Come, boy. One of these cheap ass arrows I ordered from Amazon (sorry Amazon) just ricocheted off the wall and hit me in the eye, leaving me permanently blind. - Boy, come read this.. Im exaggerating a bit (not much, though), but that was the gist of their relationship

[2] One of the only bright spots in the game - the combat! Ill admit that I tinkered with the controls at first, because I couldn't get used to it. However, I was finally able to adapt to it, and I enjoyed it. The axe felt really good to use, and I enjoyed being able to throw it all over the place. If you get tired of using it, you can always fight with your bare fist, or even make use of the rune attacks, once unlocked. I know a lot of people didn't make use of The Boy, but I actually liked how he was incorporated in the combat. I used him to stun enemies, while I finished them off. While Im not necessarily against the over the shoulder view, I don't think its a good approach for a game that requires you to fight multiple enemies at once. The combat shined in the 1 on 1 battles, and God knows there weren't NEARLY enough of these! I hope you enjoyed these first two paragraphs, because it all goes downhill from here.

[3] I make it a point not to pay attention to the story in most games, but I decided to keep an eye on this one. It started off quite well, but quickly turned into something I didn't really care about. I don't know guys, maybe I just prefer the Greek Mythology over this Norse nonsense. The only character I gave a damn about was Freya - until I found out who her son was. I know Thor is the big name when it comes to Norse Mythology but I never cared about or liked Thor in any movie I saw him in, so why would this game be any different? Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hercules ---- Baldur, Odin, Thor? Come on guys, theres no comparison here.

[4] The enemies are the biggest disappointment in the game. Outside of the Valkyries and the Travelers; the enemy design was very redundant and quite frankly - lazy. I enjoyed the Valkyrie fights because they were tough one on one fights. Although I did not fight all of them , I fought enough to know that each fight felt like its own fight, as opposed to the troll mini bosses who were copy and pasted from previous encounters (with a different name). This approach is fine for a game like Mad Max where enemies and combat are not the focus. But for God of War, this is egregious and unacceptable. Boring enemies and God of War should never go hand in hand. I feel like there were less than 10 enemy types, and except for the aforementioned Travelers and Valkyries (the Valkyries were optional bosses by the way), none of them were memorable. For example, one of my favorite enemies from God of War 3 were the Centaurs. Although they were non-bosses, the encounters were always tremendous, and I really enjoyed the fight. Oh boy, the boss battles were God awful! I cant think of a single one that I enjoyed. They felt scripted, and I probably could have succeeded with my eyes closed. This is not a hyperbolic statement because I literally fell asleep while playing. Ive never enjoyed boss battles that stop in mid battle, only to include a scripted cut scene. Stop playing the game for me and allow me to get my money's worth!!!! I came away feeling like enemies and boss battles were an afterthought.

[5] Im not sure where to begin with this one. Again, another God of War staple has always been the puzzles. Remember the maze puzzle in God of War 3? In this game, the typical puzzle required you to find three hidden spheres, and when you find them, throw your axe at them. If you find and hit all three, you get to open the chest that contains an item needed in order to extend your health and rage meters. I reached a point where I got sick to my stomach whenever I came across one of those stupid chests. One or two of those would have been fine, but they really overdid it. If they're interested in how to pull off good RPG puzzles, they may want to break bread with the Tomb Raider team; just saying I cant take credit for this comparison, but another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he compared the puzzles to Wheres Waldo?. LOL!!!

[6] Why on earth would fast travel be disabled through the first half of the game? When it comes to RPGs, fast travel has always been very important to me. Well, Ill rephrase that; it depends on the game. Take Horizon Zero Dawn for example; although fast-travel was done very well, I rarely used it because I preferred to ride a mount and look at the beautiful landscape. Maybe they should have given Kratos a mount because that slow ass boat wasn't cutting it, sorry. I guess Kratos story telling sessions with The Boy was supposed to make me forget I was riding in a damn rowboat that had a maximum speed of 0.5 knots per hour. I remember a specific moment where I needed to travel back to the Witch's house. For the life of me, I couldn't find my way back there. There was a fast-travel station near that area, but guess what? You guessed it, fast-travel was still disabled at this point. Once fast-travel was FINALLY available, you would assume I would be happy, right? Wrong! Guys, its so cumbersome. Traveling back and forth within the same realm wasn't too bad; but if you needed to go to a different realm, oh boy. I felt like they tried to rationalize going back and forth between realms, and make it seem realistic as possible. Guys, its a damn video game, and I don't play them for their realism. Heres an idea: Hover over the realm you want to travel to, and press X. Boom, done. Not rocket science

[7] Im starting to sound like a broken record, but if they want to understand how to properly handle backtracking in a RPG, they should have talked to the guys and gals behind Tomb Raider. I spent what felt like three hours climbing up all of these godforsaken walls and ledges, only to find out that I cant get through because Im missing the proper tool or item. What? Tomb Raider won't even allow you to access the freaking area until you have the right equipment. And of course, its easy to travel back and forth. If I can be honest, I didn't bother going back to revisit some of the areas, even once I had the equipment. By the time I obtained the equipment, I completely lost interest, and/or forgot where I was supposed to backtrack to in the first place. Well done, developers; well done...

[8] I was very excited to learn there would be sidemissions in a God of War game!  While the sidemissions (referred to as Favors) were not bad per se; they ended up being pointless. When I think of sidemissios, I think of all of the cool rewards I get after completing them!! There weren't that many sidemissions to begin with, so I don't see anything wrong with hoping for great rewards from the few that were in the game. Ideally, maybe an upgrade for the axe as a reward? Now that I think  about it; I believe the best reward that I received actually was an axe handle. But, it was weaker than the one I already owned, so whats the point? Back to the Valkyries for a second. Although I enjoyed the fights; I didn't see a point in completing that particular sidemission. Im assuming the reward was an armor set (I really don't know); but I had already finished the main story, so why would I need the armor set? I would have preferred to receive a reward after killing each individual Valkyrie.

I know my review will rub many people the wrong way, and my response to them is - Good, Im glad :) No game is above reproach, including God of War. Im not a fan of the Uncharted series, but I get why so many people like it. I just don't see it with this game, based on what the franchise used to be. If this were a new IP, I probably would have passed on it because my gut feeling wasn't good. However, I blindly trusted the developers because they always delivered in the past. I was hoping it would be closer to Horizon Zero Dawn than The Last of Us; but thats not how it shaped up for me. In my heart, I believe theres a good game buried in there somewhere, so heres to hoping that part 2 will be more to my liking (people love it the way it is, so I doubt there will be changes).

58190,2701,208,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE SEQUEL MORE THAN OF THIS ORIGINAL TLOU GAME

Mixture of shooter-type gaming and an apocalyptical  story line. The 2 protagonists are fearless and funny, continually cracking jokes while at the edge of their demise. Think James Bond - they know they are immortal, so may as well have fun killing the bad guys. Terrific scenery and music. I liked it well enough to play it half a dozen times over the past few years.
  I'm glad I did, as I was tempted to look for a sequel. There are sequel clips available. Same main characters, but 5 years older. Those clips make the sequel look dark, dreary , depressing. No more cute Ellie - now she's a killing machine. No more mentor Joel, now he's no better at mayhem than the 5 years later Ellie. Throw in that the grown up Ellie turns out to be homosexual and I've saved 60 bucks! I'll keep my feelings about LGBT to myself, please keep it out of your games.
  Watching the few minutes of the Trailer was depressing. I can only imagine a game built on the re-purposed main characters. I can do a Google on ""Zombie Apocalypse games"" and get about a jillion hits. To repeat myself, I am satisfied that TLOU was one of the most thoughtful games I've played (I go back to the Atari days!). The sequel looks like pure garbage.",review sequel origin tlou game mixtur shootertyp game apocalypt stori line 2 protagonist fearless funni continu crack joke edg demis think jame bond know immort may well fun kill bad guy terrif sceneri music like well enough play half dozen time past year im glad tempt look sequel sequel clip avail main charact 5 year older clip make sequel look dark dreari depress cute elli she kill machin mentor joel he better mayhem 5 year later elli throw grown elli turn homosexu ive save 60 buck ill keep feel lgbt plea keep game watch minut trailer depress imagin game built repurpos main charact googl zombi apocalyps game get jillion hit repeat satisfi tlou one thought game ive play go back atari day sequel look like pure garbag,1528934400,2

As long as your mousepad is *pristine*, all will be well, but the slightest crumb, hair, or bit of debris that gets on the pad will randomly cause the mouse to lose tracking in one direction.

As a gamer, this is unforgivable. Suddenly only being able to move left/right or up/down is a death sentence. I've wiped down the mouse and pad with a damp cloth, and it just happens again later, seemingly at random.

The Go Plus feels pretty solid.  Plastic but not cheap.  When it works, it's a cool way to snag stops and Pokmon without having to bury your face into your phone, just pressing a button and getting new stuff.  The problem is, connectivity with the Go Plus and my phone was abysmal to put it lightly.  I got maybe about 2 days maximum use out of the PGP.  I paired the PGP, it worked okay for maybe a day, but I would get an error.  I reset it to factory settings and reinstalled Pokmon Go, and that seemed to fix the issue for a bit.  I went out with my fiance, the restaurant we ate at was a stop, and the PGP went off frequently, I picked up several Pokmon and items.

58221,4880,4083,"If you'd ask me whaat wireless gaming headphones to buy, I'd say these if they were at your chosen price point. But honestly for how much they are they should be so much better.

I had the previous generation Astro A50s for my xbox and upgraded when those fell apart. The biggest difference between the two is this pair are totally wireless and don't have to connect directly to your controller, which was a pain when using the previous iteration. The downside is they are locked to Xbox/PC, where the old version could be used on Xbox/PC and PS4. It's a trade off to be sure, and for those that only own one console a total non-issue, but it was for me.

The other thing was at this price I really think they could be better, both in build and sound quality. Setting the headphones bottom down in the charge tray is finicky; you have to place them down in a shallow tray just right so these little metal parts of the headset meet the parts of the tray to make sure it's charging. Like most of the features of this headset I felt it could've been done better.

58231,373,3125,"I purchased this product because I was looking for a way to stop my hands from feeling hot and sweaty. I've used several other methods to try and keep my hands dry & cool while video-gaming. I've tried wiping my hands on my pants, a towel, using a small fan, and I've even tried official gaming gloves (see my review on those). I've even gone so far as to try biking gloves, to see if they would help. I'm happy to say that GamerGrip works as intended for me.

I could feel the product work immediately as I began to use it. Just as the directions recommend, and pea sized amount is all that needed. Upon applying the lotion, I immediately began to feel it working. It has a nice smell of spearmint too. After drying, the product immediately made my hands feel dry--with a slight tacky grip. Unfortunately, after having the product on my hands for 90-minutes, my palms began to itch and slightly break out. I do not have profusely sweaty hands, so this product worked for me (at least)--and it stopped my hands from feeling hot and moist. However, the slight irritation to my skin is concerning.

Unfortunately I can't recommend this product, based on my own experience and use of it. It appears to do as it states, but at a cost of skin irritation & itching on my hands. Also, the price of this product is too much for only 1-ounce.

You can modify and edit what your car looks like, and change the game type that you are playing such as (hoops, soccer, and ice hockey). This makes for a lot of action and fun! One really nice thing about Rocket League is that you can choose to play online or offline. So if you do not feel like paying extra money for ps4 plus you can still play Rocket League.

58236,6122,2104,"Here is where the game sucks:
1.  You get this whole deal about being able to use old saves from DAO and DA2.  The reality is, it has next to no actual affect on game play or story.  The hype on that was a huge disappointment, that alone would make it 4 stars if it was perfect, but it isn't.
2.  It feels like you get pigeon holed to quickly in the game for what role your characters are playing compared to DAO, but let's face it, DAO was a trailblazer. This was just another forgettable game that you pray you can get at least a dollar out of by trading it in at Gamestop.
3.  All of the mages feel like they play the same, except the knight enchanter, which frankly after you play knight enchanter there is no reason to ever play anything else.  The knight enchanter is so horribly OP that you really don't even need a group, you can just transfer your damage into a barrier which is basically a form of temporary hp.  Never say die basically.
4.  The warriors basically suck - the only use I have for them are meat shields, but again, knight enchanter does a better job at this + more damage.
5.  Rogues could be fun but the combat system is so that it is over simplified and the abilities you could be using to make a huge difference just end up being flash no substance.
6.  The next part some don't agree with me, but this is a chicks game.  There is only one purely straight female love interest in the game and she acts more like a guy, she is ugly, and looks more like a guy.  There is a bisexual female character you can make your love interest but she is  bland and uninteresting, and she is your NPC diplomat, meaning she has no active adventuring role with you.  Kinda lame.
7.  Yeah, we get it, EA is trying to look friendly to certain segments of the gaming population.  But they really go overboard with this.  It feels like the entire cast posts on tumblr or was dreamed up of how regular people are by people on tumblr
-We have a trans character randomly shoehorned in, acting as a second in command for a mercenary company, thinks she is a guy or something
-the guy who runs it is bisexual,
-the one elf lady you can get into your group is a lesbian, not even attractive
-oh yeah, the one character who could have had more done with him seeing he is from the Imperium and they make him a gay man
(Yeah I get it, Leliana from DOA is bi and the weird assassin guy is too, but they were actually interesting characters)
8.  Given 6 and 7, and other inconsistencies with the story, I would say even if the combat system and class system was perfect, it would drop the game to at least a 3 star, that's just how bad the story is.
9.  The game is just to damn long.  It doesn't feel like it gets anywhere for hours and hours and then you finally beat it.  When I played it, some of the quests were screwed up.
10.  The dialogue, it is terrible.  I am not the best writer in the world, and maybe I have been spoiled on good writing, whoever wrote the story and dialogue for this game seems like they unintentionally tried to make everyone suffer from Asperger Syndrome.  I mean I actually loved Sand who would scream about ""ENCHANTMENT!"", I thought it was awesome, what isn't awesome is when your writing is so bad everyone seems like a slight step up from that.
11.  The story does not convey a serious difference between the protagonists and the antagonist other than ""bad guy keel everyone if we lose ok?""  There is little to no motivation for the main bad guy other than he wants to be a god, but a god of what?  Corpses and dark spawn?  Lol, ok.....  As a player I had no motivation to even care about the protagonists.  There was maybe two I considered redeemable or even decent, the rest of them were tedious rewrites of each other.
12.  The graphics are hot garbage, not much of an improvement from 2 or even origins, and at least those two had better gameplay.  The only thing that sort of redeemed it was being able to change almost anything about the characters appearance.

The things that are good about this game, I only put this in here so if you read the junk above and think ""I don't mind mediocre games with bad stories"", maybe this will convince you to buy it.
1.  You get to be an elf, human, dwarf, quannari.  Pretty cool, nice change from 2.  Being a Quannari is awesome just because you don't get to in the others.  There isn't much mechanical difference between them all, the dwarf still can't do magic of course, which is fine.
2.  Your race choice actually makes some difference in the story
3.  The history you choose does impact the game as well
4.  I found the crafting system to be decent, it was not quite perfect but a very good attempt was made.  More options would have been better
5.  The expansions were actually pretty fun.  Honestly I enjoyed them more than the main story.  It would have been better to base the entire story around them, maybe cut out most of the characters and replace them with ones from Origins and 2.  If they did that I would have gave this at least a four star, three if I was drunk.  lol

58250,2865,4509,"GOW is a game that borrows much from previously released and better games; Tomb Raider, Last of Us and of course Bloodborne.
It does this to revolutionize the franchise which was pretty much a winning streak (minus Ascension) all the way through.
Now, out of all the games to copy from, it sure looks like they tried to move away from an already perfect fighting system.
You should've tried to make this an Original GOW game and not re-doing it from top to bottom.
Openworld not necessary for a good GOW game, but I like that they tried.
Looks wise, well, we all know the game is slick so let's not waste time there.
Upgrading sucks, exploring sucks because unless you have finished the game you will not have what you need to explore everything.
Basically, play the game first like we want or enjoy backtracking a lot.
So did you get that? The devs want you to finish the game and then explore and that is honestly the best option but it sucks you have to do this on their schedule.
Levelling for enemies, I have always hated this as its just a stall tactic and apparently nobody picked up on this.
Makes no sense, just forces you to grind more and then once you and the enemy are on the same level, it is pretty much like all the other fights.
Of course you can modify this by going in overlevelled to make it a cake walk or underlevelled if you want a real challenge but ultimately the mechanic is a way to keep you from going into areas that they don't want you accessing yet, and oh boy do they like to do that in this game.
Travel time and how to get there.
Not fond of this either.
When I first went to use the portal doors, I stupidly thought that I would pick my spot on the map, hit a button, go through the door and re-appear on the other side, magically transported to where I wanted to go, but oh no, we need to add in some conversations and actually make you walk down on otherworldly pathway to the magic door, which by default takes only 30 seconds to a minute, but what a stick in the wheel. Ditto the rowboat. And don't get me started when it comes to going to other to worlds cause it really makes me not want to travel to other worlds.
And it becomes really tedious when the conversations are exhausted and it's only silence for the whole stretch.
Solution: don't put this crap in a GOW game.
Levelling is ridiculous, clearly made to make you play at their pace and then go exploring but so far what I have put on is working and no real reason to go up and look for more until the end.
Nothing was supremely innovated with the copy pasting features of other games.
The one area where I couldn't complain if I wanted to is the combat styles:
The axe is awesome, love the Thor return to hand effect it has and being able to throw it around was nice and then you get a pretty comprehensive bare-handed combat and eventually the sweet, sweet blades of chaos.
All fleshed out with unique moves and upgrades,  and this is the end of any really stand out parts of the game as the rest is more akin to watching a movie then what a lot were expecting in GOW game.
As a matter of fact, the new more personal camera view is a drag when fighting in higher numbers then one, which happens a lot and has been mentioned in many reviews.
I do like the oral cues, like watch your left from the boy and the head but this is not an ideal view for what I want to achieve, it is unfortunately passable so people put up with it, but it may take some adjusting, which is super weird because like I hinted at before, combat did not need to be re-invented in any shape, way or form but it was going to get updated and thats  the real shame here, taking the perfect part of any game franchise and wiping your butt with it instead of using it correctly.
To re-iterate the combat was already perfect and should not have been messed with, as there was no reason.  5 bloody games all the same, all successful (minus ascension) using the same fixed view point.
Yeah that needs to be changed. STAT.
Its one of the most divisive games as far as gaming generations go, the true fans (you know the ones who have played all the GOW years ago multiple times) are now wrinkly old granpas and the new  fans aren't even really fans, you just like this one GOW game cause thats all you played and don't know better. (Im sure there are exceptions and some old schoolers like this new vision of GOW and vice versa)
And it becomes unashamedly directed to younger people, when the Mimir says  A little swole  in the middle of a battle, advising Kratos that his enemy is really OP (overpowered).
Swole?? What genius managed to get that to popular status for pumped up?
Just say he is ""jacked up"" and move on.
But on to a more interesting note, it would be just as jarring and reality breaking if the boy said gnarly dude which we all know that ones been around for a while so I guess it needed the new slang lexicon to you know, practically flat out tell you this game is designed for the younger hipper crowd.
But hey thanks for playing the first games and putting this badass on the map.
And another thing,  pretty doesnt a game make, and this is the biggest bragging rights the game has, the way it looks, and Id sacrifice half of that for that awesome and yes even familiar battle mechanics.
Seriously, I could go on and on...I mean there some joy to be found for sure, but this is not a GOW game.
If this were a true GOW game the emphasis would ve been on bigger badder boss battles, more creature type foes, brutal executions and  proper nipples instead of Nipelheim and not on exploring, levelling up or drawing out the experience just to say ""Like how pretty our game is? Isn't it pretty?""
Which is rarely a minus but I wanted not to have to sit back for 10 minutes of cutscenes and travel time, it became a real deal breaker with me near the end.
Fun game but I miss the GOW 1,2,and 3 when the camera angles were so perfect, you didn't need a joystick to adjust them constantly and could utilize jumps as attacks and to avoid damage, now it's block, dodge or run. (how is that better?)
Also, having read the overwhelming  5 on 5 reviews that are just piling up, one tends to wonder, are they comparing it to the original GOW games or on its own merits, because I can promise you the real fans of GOW are only comparing GOW PS4 to the originals and the twenty somethings who probably never even played a GOW game are in love with this, but THIS, did not put GOW on the map, it was very much there being enjoyed thoroughly by it's true fans and therefore the twenty somethings DON""T HAVE ALL THE FACTS.
Go play all the other GOW games, trust me, they're more fun and more open to replayability.
I will finish this and complete most quests afterwards (the valkyries must be freed) but it was so long and slow at times, that I know I'm not going to replay this unless I get amnesia.",gow game borrow much previous releas better game tomb raider last u cours bloodborn revolution franchis pretti much win streak minu ascens way game copi sure look like tri move away alreadi perfect fight system shouldv tri make origin gow game redo top bottom openworld necessari good gow game like tri look wise well know game slick let wast time upgrad suck explor suck unless finish game need explor everyth basic play game first like want enjoy backtrack lot get dev want finish game explor honestli best option suck schedul level enemi alway hate stall tactic appar nobodi pick make sen forc grind enemi level pretti much like fight cours modifi go overlevel make cake walk underlevel want real challeng ultim mechan way keep go area dont want access yet oh boy like game travel time get fond,1529280000,3

From climbing to shooting an back to climbing some points in between was awesome great play. At first I started the game off jumping right into that naughty dog action packed uncharted world with guns blazing. I felt the game was Abit cheesy especially when you tap into a boat or grind against it an next thing you know it's doing summer sault's in the air or blowing up 6ft in the air. So for me it started Abit cheesy an started to see why ign got so much hate on the review they left for this game giving it a 9 star rating and as I progress into the game further. It really picked up giving me a smooth control feeling over the characters having a nice quality look hitting small details that really make a game stand out.
Now please keep in mind an like I say for everything an every game not everyone has the same taste for what one finds Amazon an really good with the other finding it lacking those things. Every one has there own taste in what they find acceptable and can look past with others finding it a big problem. For me I feel it has more potential that needed some more work but on the other hand found it very enjoyable to play giving me a great action packed adventure threw all sorts of environments from the seas to urban areas to being in the jungle. Just because your toes don't curl in your shoes when you walk or trip over every bump giving it that real life feel don't mean this is a bad game.

The reason I purchased so many is because of the great price and the top-notch quality. I love the texture of these mice, my hand has never slipped off. The side numbered buttons are shaped in such a way that it makes it easy to find the button you want to press without looking. Also, these buttons have the perfect press down threshold which helps me to not press down the wrong button at the wrong time by accident--which is super important when playing a video game.

Lastly, their customer service is by far the best. They respond quickly and stand by their warranty, and I know this by a recent experience.

58345,1012,283,"First of all... remember that the difficulty is what makes games fun for a lot of people who play FromSoftware's titles. Death is a mechanic that forces you to learn or die. If you want something that you can run right through or you get easily aggravated, this game may not be for you. And although this game has it's flaws, it still lands in my top 10 favorite games.

Pros
  The design of the game is my favorite of all time. Yharnam is where the game takes place and has a very cool Victorian era vibe. Everything from the enemies to the clothes to the weapons follow this victorian style mixed with the blood theme found throughout the game. But it's not just the style of the game that makes it cool, it's the fact that everything is very tightly interconnected. You could be mid-way through the game and find a shortcut that leads to a locked door found in the very first spawn area. This makes each new area exciting to explore knowing that you may run into an area that was out of reach hours earlier.
  The combat is much faster in comparison to dark souls 1 and 2 and there is not much potential for stun locking enemies like in dark souls 3. This make using invincibility frames a necessity and dodging one of the most used mechanics. When you I-frame your way through a group of enemies or a boss taking no damage, you feel so good. The game prioritizes skill over the memorization. Knowing the enemies weaknesses is important, but the developing skills in timing dodges and attacks as well as morph attacks is what can separate an experience hunter from an inexperienced hunter. Mastering this fast paced combat is far more fulfilling than almost any other part of the game.
  The story, in my mind, is kind of a mixed bag. At the beginning of the game, all I wanted to do was figure out the origins of the disease and hunter's dream and yharnam, but later in the game things start to get really weird. My original questions were never answered and new questions kept forming over and over. By the end of the game, I didn't even care what happened, I was just glad to be done. It seems like a fair amount of studying is required to answer some of these questions. What can you expect from a FromSoftware game? I wasn't expecting to get any answers, I was just annoyed getting task after task later in the game and not even given a reason why. Let's just say that the gameplay is good enough to make  late game fun even though story progresses too fast to even make any sense.
  Other pros
  -All of the armor looks great (IDK why some games make the best armor look so dumb).
  -The characters are very memorable and I actually care about the quests.
  -The game is frightening in a very good way. I'm nervous when playing even though I know what's coming.
Cons
  The game demands perfection but can't exactly deliver the same. Annoying hitboxes, broken mechanics, and 30 fps can subtract from that amazing gameplay I mentioned earlier. Since it's not on xbox, the frame rate isn't as much of a problem, but can interfere with I-frames in certain situations, which will usually result in death or near death. Most mechanics work perfectly fine, but there are two that come to mind. One of which is dodging whilst targeting a moving enemy. Your character will dodge based on their relation to the enemy. This can cause your character to dodge into some very annoying directions that you didn't want just because the enemy made a quick movement. Additional enemies and switching between targeting them while dodging backwards can be a recipe for death and can be very aggravating. The other problem is locked in hits. A enemy will attack and you will time your dodge to I-frame through it but you will remain locked in place even though the attack hasn't hit you. Doesn't happen often and your moves don't queue so it won't screw you up that bad, just really annoying when it does kill you or allows an enemy to land a heavy blow.
  BOSSES! Not gonna lie, they kinda suck! There aren't that many bosses in the game, but most of them are the EXACT SAME! A giant hairy best that tries to horizontal swipe you with its claws 100 million times. I died a few times to the first few bosses, but after I got the lame formula down, the rest of the bosses were boring. Hats off to Martyr Logarius for actually being a challenge, the inability to visceral attack him on a slope is another broken mechanic, but you start to get used to being screwed over by crap in the boss fights anyways. The parts in-between the boss fights are what really shine. (I haven't played DLC yet).
  A few other problems in the game
  -4 different attributes allow you to wield certain weapons. Since there are no classes in bloodborne you don't know what the weapon will be like until you try it. But you can't try all weapons without spending tons of blood echoes to level up the 4 attributes.
  -Even some the the heavier, longer timing weapons won't stun enemies even though it's almost required that they do.
  -Blood vials (healing items) don't re-spawn like in dark souls. So if you encounter something that you can't beat right away, you may have to go farm blood vials for a while which really slows the game to a grinding halt. It can make the game very boring if you have to farm blood vials for hours.

  Overall, the game has it's flaws and the bosses aren't that great, but the gameplay is sooooo much fun and makes up for any flaws. The design is so great, and the weapons that I have used are all very cool.

58348,7959,572,"I gotta say, this keypad a a pretty good ergonomic option if you don't want to use a keyboard. The key switches feel like mechanical but a tad bit mushy feeling. The ergonomics are a strong point on this thing, its very nice in the hand. The keys are easy to reach and the scroll and dpad/joystick are nice touches as well. The lights are really good and are bright. However, things start to go downhill from there. The software used to make macros and custom lighting (Razer Synapse 3) is actually terrible. The software is a resource hog. Ever since I got this thing and had to install the software, my PC takes about 3 times as long to start than it used to, and I have a pretty good gaming PC so it shouldnt be slowed down too much. Ive had to resort to make it (and anything Razer related) start manually instead of automatically. Even with that the software takes forever to startup. It also has an update almost everyday like Java. I never had a problem with the original Synapse so why did Razer all of a sudden think it was a good idea to make new software that isn't as good as the original. Im hopeful that the software in one of its million updates fixes the startup resource issue. Would I recommend this?

58349,4941,72,"This game is a director's cut of the movie, which was a director's cut of the 2002 game based on the same name. I was reluctant on watching the movie, but I might watch it now after playing this game.

The story is that a Lombax named Ratchet dreams of being a Galactic Ranger, among the ranks of Captain Qwark, whom he idolizes.  But when he tries to become one, he is rejected.  Meanwhile, a robot named Clank, who was meant to be a ruthless Warbot, was made by mistake as a small, but intelligent, harmless robot.  He quickly escapes the facility and finds him self on Veldin, where Ratchet lives.  Meanwhile, a dark, sinister plot is brewing, and Ratchet and Clank must prove they are worthy to be among the ranks of the Galactic Rangers and save the galaxy.

Gameplay is the same as all the other Ratchet and Clank games: A run and gun platformer, and a darn good one.  This takes elements of the other games and combines a lot of them into a great game.  There's only one thing I don't like about his game, but we'll get into that.  The goal is to explore each level, accomplish objectives, purchase and level up your weapons, defeat bosses.  Longtime Ratchet and Clank fans will feel right at home as they blast their way through level after awesome level.  There are plenty of side objectives that unlock extra goodies.  Players can find cards scattered throughout the game, some dropped by enemies and others hidden away.  Completing sets of cards unlocks bonuses so they're well worth gathering.  Controls are tight and responsive and it's a great time blasting away your enemies to save the galaxy.

The levels are massive with a lot to explore, and you will be rewarded for doing the optional quests.  Aside from the cards, there are also hidden Gold Bolts that unlock extra goodies.  And when you finish the game, you will have the option to replay the game in challenge mode.  It's a harder romp but you will have a bolt multiplier and all your previous weapons and gadgets.  It's a ton of fun and a good chance to gather up anything you missed.

The one major flaw I have with the game is the camera.  See, when you go into an aiming mode, it inverts the controls, and you can't turn this off! It makes no sense to me and has caused me more than a few deaths.  Other games have done this and I cannot understand the benefit of changing the camera controls while aiming and now allowing you to undo it. Sure, I can teach myself to move the sticks different directions when aiming, but when I turn off the game and come back to it, I Have to relearn it all.  It has driven me to turning off the game a few times.  But that's the one major flaw I have with the game.

Presentation is amazing.  The graphics are awesome, some of the cutscenes are ripped from the movie, but not all of them are.  The music is awesome and gets you pumped for the action, and the voice acting is spot on.  The actors from the movie returned to voice their characters and they do a great job playing off each other.  Ultimately a great tribute to a great game series.  Captain Qwark narrates the action, and his play by play commentary got a laugh from me on more than a few occasions.

So, if you have a PS4 or are planning on getting one, do yourself a favor and pick up the quintessential run and gun game.

58350,9752,1412,"I've always been into racing and having a little racing simulator at home just seemed like something that would be awesome!

And don't get me wrong, this thing is very fun and I still use it. I bought this specifically to play Forza on Xbox One. Bought it as soon at Forza Horizon 3 came out. It is fantastic for that game. It really is a good time, driving is easy and fun. Hint, use 480 degrees turning on the wheel setting for video games. 900 degrees is just too much.

The pedals feel like a real car, the gas is light and easy to push, the clutch is medium and the brake is hard. The shifter does not feel like a real car at all. I can shift into any gear by literally flicking my finger at the shift knob. I wish there was more weight to it. Also, in today's day, most cars have more than 6 gears. This shifter only has 6 so if you are playing with a car with more gears, you are out of luck.

The steering wheel is ehhh. It does not feel like a real car at all. The steering wheel is soooo tiny and not even close to a real car and the force feedback is weird, it just shakes the steering wheel. Doesn't have a ""real car"" feel even a little bit.

The thing that I really like about this wheel is how much fun it is to play on arcade racing games like Need for Speed or Forza Horizon. Once you get into the real racing sims like Forza 7, it is nearly impossible to drive. I use a controller on that game cause the steering wheel is so unrealistic and hard to use that it is just not fun.

If I were going to buy another racing sim, I would honestly save more money and get the Fanatec setup. It's such a better experience.",ive alway race littl race simul home seem like someth would awesom dont get wrong thing fun still use bought specif play forza xbox one bought soon forza horizon 3 came fantast game realli good time drive easi fun hint use 480 degre turn wheel set video game 900 degre much pedal feel like real car ga light easi push clutch medium brake hard shifter feel like real car shift gear liter flick finger shift knob wish weight also today day car 6 gear shifter 6 play car gear luck steer wheel ehhh feel like real car steer wheel soooo tini even close real car forc feedback weird shake steer wheel doesnt real car feel even littl bit thing realli like wheel much fun play arcad race game like need speed forza horizon get real race sim like forza 7 nearli imposs drive use control game caus steer wheel unrealist hard use,1529625600,3

58359,8889,356,"It really lacks some fun options and lacks a lot of match options the previous games had, that made for a lot of fun. For instance you can't turn off the over the top rope as an option in battle royals.  Match options are pretty much automatic depending on what type of match you're playing. When you go to match options after picking your character it only gives you the choice of momentum on or off, title match and the areana you want to play in.

In previous games like 2K14 you could turn off pins, submissions, over the top rope, etc. There was an option to turn on KO's. The submission system in this game is horrible and difficult. You can totally be winning a match the entire time and suddenly lose because the system is so bad.

As a long time player of Raw vs Smackdown, Here comes the pain, WWe12, and Wwe13 the change from using the D-pad to using the left stick for grapples is super annoying. Should have left the left stick as taunts. OH and unlike previous games there's no option to change the controller to different match options. There used to be a few options for different controller configurations depending on what you needed. (what if you're a southpaw?).

The graphics are good, Big improvement on the graphics over the ps2 and ps3 wwe games. Despite the nit picking i think its an improvement over wwe2k15.  One thing I find slightly annoying and is a huge nit pick is that when you go to select your wrestler and hit the button for superstars it automatically every single time goes straight to austin, and when you pick the next one unless you're picking someone from a team/stable for some reason goes straight to seth rollins.

58362,8038,3574,"This thing is poorly built. It uses very light and cheap plastic. The sticks are loose and have an awkward dead-zone. They move around if you shake the controller. All the buttons feel loose and the actuation doesn't have much of a resistance in a form of a satisfying, solid click. It's too bad because it's a good looking controller.

Pairing with devices is even more finicky. This works really well for Android. It seems that it was their priority when programming the device. It's finicky in Windows10 or Mac. It doesn't detect the controller is connected even when you successfully pair it OR it would connect properly but not detect any button presses or stick movements. Some people have resorted to using a Third-Party software, but that's lame. It's all bad.

Bluetooth is also pretty faulty. It only works at short distances to devices it's connected to -- I'm talking unreasonably short distances like 2-3 feet.

I noticed that they did not fully fit my head. I don't have a big head so even on the smallest setting, these were a little loose and I felt my ear hitting the top of the headphone part.

There is no way to adjust how much to want to hear the game vs talking to someone in the headphones. On my new Turtle Beaches, you do have that and it's a great feature.

The overall sound is not bad, but it's nothing special either. You don't get the heavy bass that you would in other headphones or even your TV speakers.

The worst part of these is that they broke after about 7 months. And by broke, you could still play and hear everything but when you are playing with others, it echoes everything in your headset and also your friend's headsets. And this is EXTREMELY annoying making any game basically unplayable.

Overall, you get what you pay for. If you get these, expect them to break at some point, probably sooner than you would like.

Uncharted 2 however fixes all of that. It features incredible set pieces after the next, while still telling a tightly written character heavy story.

Very comfortable on my head and fits really nicely. Check the pricing daily on Amazon for these because it varies. I got them for $90 and a week later it was $150.

The sound quality is really nice, comparing it to all my other headsets, this one takes the cake every day. The bass is nice and deep but not too loud and the treble is just perfect. I really enjoy that I can take the mic out and use these as regular headphones on long trips.

There are a few reasons why I did not give five stars though.

1. I don't like how each game you play, (I'm on Xbox One) has a different level of sound. I'm not sure if this is the headset or the game but I'm constantly adjusting the mic monitoring levels from game to chat. If it means anything, this has not happened with any other headset or just my TV volume. Making me believe it is the headset itself.
2. The cable is a bit too long meaning it gets tangled a lot and caught on things ripping the headset off of your head when you are walking.
3. I don't like that there is another adapter that connects on the wire near the top of the cord. This gets ripped out here and there and then when that happens, you have to take the headset off to attach it again. This is sort of hard to explain but if you have this, I'm sure you understand.

58459,9769,4505,"When I first played I thought this game was really cool.  I still think it's an okay thing and experience, but the new content released to the players is meant strictly to get people to socially interact with one another.  That's not really a bad thing in and of itself, but it means that if you're a solo player, then you're essentially frozen out of things like the megalodon or an attack by the kraken and so forth.

As a solo player you can sail around and engage in the lower tier or lower level quests, and explore the game environment, but that's all you can do.  You can't fight the kraken by yourself if you're so inclined to trying, nor any of the other higher tier challenges.

I'm an old school gamer.  I like the single player experience.  I'm not against multiplayer gaming in the least, but the promise of this game is that you can meet the challenges with the group or by yourself.  And that's simply not the case, as you are forced to meet other people, whether you like them or not, and given the huge trolling problem from other players in the game, odds are it's going to be hard to meet those challenges with anyone you like gaming with.

So, the graphics are pretty outstanding, the ocean and islands are expansive, the sailing itself is kind of cool, but it's like this whole game is a sociological tool, and I simply don't appreciate the manipulation and denial of what I think should be the full gaming experience as a solo player.

New content is coming, and I've tossed in a number of ideas, but it's like you can't benefit from them unless you meet the social psychological criteria.  I've had this thing installed for a couple of months now, and I've just grown tired of it.  It was unique and novel at first, but denying me the chance of taking on the new challenges because I like to solo, is effectively freezing out a portion of your customer base.

58460,7442,161,"After playing through Mankind Divided on PS4 Pro I felt nostalgic and fired up Human Revolution.  I hadn't played it since release years ago and in my mind the two games were about equal.

Just finished it a second time and WOW.  I forgot how much better this game is than the newer installment.  Yes, the ending is rushed.  Yes, it suffers from unfinished side plots and some odd design decisions just like MD.  But the main story and the character development is in a different league.  Jensen's story of betrayal and revenge in this title fits the Deus Ex franchise so well.  MD is lackluster in comparison.

The gameplay is also just more fun.  I can't quite explain why.  Unlocking augs feels more rewarding here than in MD.  The factions are more interesting and varied.  If feels like a bigger world with the multiple hub cities.

One tip if playing on PC: I don't recommend the ""Director's Cut"". It is a port from the Wii version and is actually a downgrade in graphical fidelity from the original.  It also eliminates the gold light effects filter, which I kind of liked.  Stick with the original version if you can find it (steam doesn't sell it anymore).",play mankind divid ps4 pro felt nostalg fire human revolut hadnt play sinc releas year ago mind two game equal finish second time wow forgot much better game newer instal ye end rush ye suffer unfinish side plot odd design decis like md main stori charact develop differ leagu jensen stori betray reveng titl fit deu ex franchis well md lacklust comparison gameplay also fun cant quit explain unlock aug feel reward md faction interest vari feel like bigger world multipl hub citi one tip play pc dont recommend director cut port wii version actual downgrad graphic fidel origin also elimin gold light effect filter kind like stick origin version find steam doesnt sell anymor,1530144000,5

58474,3606,4511,"Right now as of this writing there is a bug where supplies (resources) can not be obtained thus everyone dies.  Also companions disappear thus you die.  The game frame rate is beginning to stutter badly during intense high number of enemies attacks. Microsoft tried to help but they can only fix Xbox related issues.  This is a developer (Undead Labs) issue I was told.  The developer has no or very poor support system.  They just try to pawn you back off to Microsoft.  I have no choice but to wait for bug fixes that I am unsure if they even know exist or give up and sell it.  So far they have only fixed small issues that had no game ending effects as these 2 do.  Oh and of course they added downloadable pay content.  Not so sure it was even worth the 30 (now 20) bucks since we got basically a beta.

Update (7-21):  There are posts that say a patch has been out since July 3 called 2.1 but I have yet to find it and it does not install when loading the game on Xbox like all others do.  2.0 did.
Update:(7-22)  Guess there was a stealth update because all of a sudden the supply issue is resolved.  Disappearing follower issue is still very present though.  Game is playable like this but only if you don't mind dying.
Another thing is why do I seem to be the only one complaining about this when there a suppose to be 3 million users of this game?
Update (8-12)  They are stealthily fixing some things while breaking many others.
Right now zombies are spawning within solid objects.  They can not be interacted with so infestations can not be cleared.
Also mission persons are not where they are suppose to be to further the missions.  They talk but are not there and can not be interacted with.  This again makes the game UNPLAYABLE.
There are many others issues but they do not make the game unplayable like the others mentioned.
Also the vehicles that you drive are no longer visible on the map so they are easy to loose at night.
Update (8-30)  Well at least it is getting worse.  Right now I am at my base with 6 residents and none of them are anywhere to be found.  None of the prior entry bugs have been fixed.  Game seems to be flaky in just about every way.  Can't rely on much of anything to work all the time and if it does it does so in a flaky way.
Update:  (9-13-18) Characters/companions issue has been poorly fixed because now they just get lost or stuck (sometimes on the car roof) instead of disappearing altogether.  Weird things are happening all over the game like smashing into invisible walls in the middle of the road.  And an issue that has always been is those barns with the metal pole fences/gates where you bump into empty spaces and can't get through to the interior.  Open gates are not open in effect.  Also all characters seem to run into invisible walls all over the place.  The currently driven car not on the radar issue is still in effect.  Real easy to loose your vehicle at night.  I would characterize the game as totally unpolished.  Many times your companion will just stand there while you are getting killed.  Only thing the companion does extraordinarily well is get between you and the enemy when you are trying to shoot the enemy.  The follower will go to great lengths to do so too to the point of jumping in front of your face. What's up with that?  I could go on and on and maybe I will once the bugs are reduced to a manageable amount.  Also why can the enemy attack you while you are changing weapon but you can not attack them back or even move at all.  Developers keep saying you should think of the game as real because you do things the way they would happen in real life but boy do they need to practice what they preach.
10-2-18  Still no current vehicle tracking.  On the disappearing follower issue, they have digressed.  Now the follower can sometimes not even reappear if you restart the game.  Impenetrable barn/stall gates issue still there.  One stall even has loot that can not be gotten because it is behind a should be easy to jump gate and an open gate that acts like a solid wall.  Sometimes if you are near any other object trying to hit a zombie is impossible as it just swings through them.  Creatures still meld with solid objects.  Followers still get stuck on car roofs and other things.  Changing characters can many times cause you to spawn far away.  Too many more issues to list.",right write bug suppli resourc obtain thu everyon die also companion disappear thu die game frame rate begin stutter badli intens high number enemi attack microsoft tri help fix xbox relat issu develop undead lab issu told develop poor support system tri pawn back microsoft choic wait bug fix unsur even know exist give sell far fix small issu game end effect 2 oh cours ad download pay content sure even worth 30 20 buck sinc got basic beta updat 721 post say patch sinc juli 3 call 21 yet find instal load game xbox like other 20 update722 guess stealth updat sudden suppli issu resolv disappear follow issu still present though game playabl like dont mind die anoth thing seem one complain suppos 3 million user game updat 812 stealthili fix thing break mani other right zombi spawn within solid object interact infest clear also mission person suppos,1530230400,2

The stand comes in a nice box, so it would make a great gift.  Keep in mind that it requires 2 AAA batteries which are not included, and you'll need a tiny screwdriver to get the battery cover off.  I used an electronics screwdriver, but a glasses repair kit will probably work too.

The stylus is larger than your normal 3DS stylus, but due to the shape of the guard (the blue part that sticks out on the sides) it isn't very comfortable to hold.  It is also flat instead of round, so it's awkward to hold.  I'm not taking a star away because I never intended to use it as a stylus because I have a large stylus I bought here on Amazon instead, but  if you wanted to use the Master Sword as a stylus, you're going to be disappointed.

I intended to use this display stand with my Wolf Link Amiibo from Twilight Princess, but I was concerned it would be too small because it is a wider Amiibo than most.  It actually fits really well.  My largest Amiibo, the Guardian from Breath of the Wild (the big machine with the tentacles, not the four heroes; the Goron hero is large but fits), ""fits"", but it only goes in one way, and it presses on the stylus in a bad way, so I would say that even though it can technically fit, it doesn't really work because that Amiibo is too big.  See picture.

When you put the sword/stylus in the stand, it makes a Zelda sword slash sound.  When you remove the sword from the stand, it plays a song.  I was hoping for the classic Zelda puzzle-discovery or treasure-obtaining songs, but it's not those, which was very disappointing. It's actually the song that plays when Link removes the Master Sword in Twilight Princess, which is appropriate, but not a memorable song like the other iconic sounds.  I removed one star for this, even though I recognize it is my personal prefernce, I think many of you Zelda fans will share it.  Still, this is a great way to display your love for the Legend of Zelda games and hold your Amiibo at the same time. Overall, I can highly recommend it to anyone, and it would make a great gift.  4/5 stars.

58479,6632,49,"I am honestly super impressed with this pad. The day I got it and tried it my original PS4 controller was put away for good! This is coming from a person who has used a PS4 controller for years. The ergonomics are really that much better! And I'm not necessarily talking about the placement of the analog sticks, as I never had an issue with the PS4's placement, but it's the outer shell where your palms rest.

Immediately I noticed input lag reduced in all my games. I always have PS4 controller plugged, so I have no idea why controller is not taking advantage of that. I think PS4 controller still communicates with Bluetooth even when plugged in, I've heard other people mention same issue.

Some people said that the triggers where a little stiff, but I noticed they are loosening it up from use, so no problem there for me. The touch pad is just like the original! I love this thing! I can't understand people complaining about it being light in weight. This is a good thing in the long run, as it becomes very comfortable for long use. I don't mind it not having a mic plug, I just use a different USB port.

Only issue I've run into is with The Last of US Remastered. Game uses PS4 controller's motion detection to turn on flashlight, which this controller doesn't have. I honestly don't blame controller though, but a stupid game design.

Though it would of been great to have rumble, given the fact that controller is plugged in and not taking battery, I'm totally cool with it.

The back trigger works really really well, and can be used to map any button, which is what I did. It's main function of slowing your aim works very well also, and it's due to the proper ergonomic placement of the back trigger. I have medium hands and everything fits perfect for me.

Right now I see it for 20 on here and for that price I'd give it 3 stars out of 5. I feel bad for anyone who paid the full 40 for this unoptimized game. Even with my gsync monitor I was getting bad stuttering.

If you want a smooth gameplay, you will have to lock the fps to 40 with Riva tuner statistics and with a gsync monitor, that will make it feel like 60 fps.

If this game was well optimized like the first one I would give it 5 out of 5 stars for the price I paid.

Graphics, 4 - I would give it a 5 if it wasn't for the lack of antialiasing feature. I set it to txaa 1 with sharpness set to 20 and it still looks blurry. If you have a 4k monitor, just set fxaa to low or high and it will get rid of the jaggies and still maintain a  crisp image.

58510,2280,1202,"This review is for the PS4 version.

I am a bit late to the NFS games, but recently got this once it was priced under 20 bucks.  My initial disappointment with this was when I found out that it does not work with my G29 racing wheel that I had just gotten.  Granted this is more of an arcade style racing game, but my learning curve with the standard controller was a bit tough for me initially.

Graphically, the game looks very good, especially considering this game is now 3 to 4 years old.  The city feels a bit empty though with only a few cars or cops here and there.  It always seems to be dark and raining as well most of the time.

I am not sure I like the online always requirement, but at least for me, I haven't found it to be a hindrance to playing solo.  I like the ability to build up your car with better parts to help you compete in the harder events.  Initially, I found that the tutorials to help you was a bit lacking in my opinion.  The sound is decent, especially with the engine.

The different missions and events are fun but get a bit repetitive.  The racing is a bit unfair at times as it seems that you have a bit lead then suddenly the competitors catch up or you can be far behind or crash and suddenly you are directly behind the pack.  I also found it a bit irritating to be in the middle of an event and some notice flashes onto your screen, forcing you to hit dismiss in the middle of your racing event, usually messing up my race.  The main story is a bit lackluster and short to me as well.

Overall, the game is ok, but gets stale and repetitive pretty fast.

58511,2280,1227,"This review is for the PS4 complete edition.

I got this game along with NFS around the holiday after they went on sale.  I have been looking for some car related games to use with my racing wheel, only to find out that both NFS and Rivals does not work with my G29 racing wheel.  Yes, this is this an arcade style racer, but I have found this game even more difficult to use with the standard controller than the NFS game, which can be a bit frustrating for a newcomer to the games like I am.

Even with my gripes with the controls, I like Rivals a bit better than the other NFS game I got.  As good as the other NFS, Rivals looks even better, with sharp looking cars and beautifully done graphics.  I really wish they would do away with the always online requirement, as I have had issues at time where I waited several minutes to connect to a server but nothing ever happened.

Being able to play the different sides with different missions and events are fun but like the other NFS, the different events get repetitive.  I do like the additional features that this game has over NFS and the story is a bit better than NFS.  I am not a online racer so I cant comment on the multiplayer features of the game.

This is an ok arcade racer game though and it has its moments of fun.  For me, the lack of wheel support and difficulty for me to adapt to the driving controls to a standard controller plus the repetitive missions make this a bit less enjoyable for me than I had hoped.

58525,288,4332,"Nier Automata is a critically acclaimed game that released in 2017 for the PS4 and PC and a year later for Xbox One. It got great reviews and a dedicated cult following that still talks about this game today. The sequel to Nier a PS3 and Xbox 360 game that nobody played. This time, Yoko Taro the games director teams up with Platinium Games for the sequel. Set thousand of years after the first game and following the Androids 2B and 9S fighting machine lifeforms that invaded the Earth. With Humanity on the brink of extinction retreating to the moon. It is up to 2B and 9S to help defeat this invasion for the glory of mankind. Is Nier Automata the masterpiece that everyone says it is? Or is it like Vanquish an overhyped game thats average at best? Short Answer is its a masterpiece that everyone must play. Why? Lets find out.

Pros:
The story. The simple plot synopsis I gave in the beginning doesnt even begin to do justice to explaining the plot of Nier Automata. A game that incorporates philosophy, religion, existentialist themes in a surprising way that aren't expected. At the surface Nier Automata is a weird Japanese game and it is weird Japanese game in a good way. Nier has a deep plot with 26 different endings in three main campaigns throughout the story; with five main endings. Which gives tons of replay value. The five main endings took me about 40 hours to complete and with the final ending leaving me with that empty feeling when you binge watch an entire show. It was one of the greatest and most memorable endings ever. With the best end credits scene ever that thing everyone skips Nier Automata makes it great. Cant praise the story enough, it one of those games that you wish you can replay again for the first time ever.

The gameplay. Nier takes it amazing story and pairs it with the most unique gameplay I ever played in a game. With constant switching of perspectives and mechanics but in its heart it is a hack and slash and a great one at that. It plays like a combination of Devil May Cry, Dark Souls, at 60 FPS, and it is glorious.  It comes with your standard upgrades for weapons, abilities and a leveling up system. The game has a chip plugin system where you can customize the way you want to play whether being a glass cannon or unkillable tank the choice is yours with three sets to mix and match. The also has a Dark Souls like mechanic where death loads you to a previous save and with a game with no autosaves you can loss significant progress if you don't save often. Happened to me late game and I lost two hours of progress which was a bummer but still I deserved it. Despite losing plot progress you can always recover you chipset and level in a mechanic that is like the Dark Souls soul recover.  Wrapping it up with the traditional transition of getting your ass kick early on to becoming an unstoppable killing machine late game.

The characters. Nier Automatas characters might all be Androids but they act more human than most characters in other games. It all ties back to the amazing story where you see these characters and you grow to like them. All with superb voice acting from actors who do mostly anime dubbing. Cant say more without giving spoilers to key plot but Suffice it to say the characters in Nier Automata are great.

Music. I hardly mention music in games but Nier Automata deserves praise for it soundtrack as it is well orchestrated and memorable.  When the music's playing in my head and Im not even playing Nier Automata thats when you know you have a great soundtrack.

The Open World. Wasnt sold on it at first thought it was another game just chasing the trends of open world games. The more I start to play it, the more it started to grow on me. To the point where I ended up loving the open world design of the game. Spend lots of time just exploring discovering new places, finding new weapons and of course fishing.

Side Missions. Another mechanic which I thought was mediocre at first. The first side mission is a literal fetch quest but luckily that wasn't the case for most side-quests. Most of the side quests had really great plots in them that are easily missable. From solving a murder mystery to finding out the memories of a Character from the first Nier game. Nier Automata has great side quests that help reinforce it main themes from the main quest. Theyre not all perfect though some are just mundane tasks like go pick this up bring me one of each that are scatter around the map. Despite those side missions coming with the territory Nier Automata still has good side quests that worth playing.

Cons:
The one biggest flaw that Nier Automata has to be its entry level. Nier Automata is a hard game to recommend without giving major spoilers or even describing it one of the those things where its better to show rather than explain. I ignored Nier Automata for a year because of this. It just didn't get my interest despite all the praise it was getting. Luckily for me I bit the bullet and manage to play it. Still, I won't blame anyone who ends up ignoring or skipping this game as its hard to describe and recommend without showing it.

Verdict:
Nier Automata is one of those games that release once in a generation. Its unique gameplay and deep story real affected me that no other game I played this generation has. Definitely my Game of the Year of 2018 in a year where I played the new God of War. Nier Automata had me playing late at night for just one more minute. A thing that I haven't experience since Fallout 4 back in 2015.  Hands down Platinum Games best game ever a studio who has been in a slump this generation bounces back. Nier Automata is worth playing it is a hidden gem that deserves all the praise and validation it got and is still getting by fans and critics. It one of those truly unique games that cant be achieved in any other media. Nier Automata is a masterpiece and definitely worth buying and playing. An unforgettable experience from start to finish.",nier automaton critic acclaim game releas 2017 ps4 pc year later xbox one got great review dedic cult follow still talk game today sequel nier ps3 xbox 360 game nobodi play time yoko taro game director team platinium game sequel set thousand year first game follow android 2b 9 fight machin lifeform invad earth human brink extinct retreat moon 2b 9 help defeat invas glori mankind nier automaton masterpiec everyon say like vanquish overhyp game that averag best short answer masterpiec everyon must play let find pro stori simpl plot synopsi gave begin doesnt even begin justic explain plot nier automaton game incorpor philosophi religion existentialist theme surpris way arent expect surfac nier automaton weird japanes game weird japanes game good way nier deep plot 26 differ end three main campaign throughout stori five main end give ton replay valu five main end took 40 hour complet final end leav empti feel bing watch entir show one greatest memor end ever best end credit scene ever thing everyon skip nier automaton make great cant prais stori enough,1530489600,5

The online play frequently locks up and actually causes my Xbox One X to shut off! This happens about 20% of the time. Ive reached out to Ubisoft, but they have no response other than reinstalling the game, which isn't the problem. It ONLY locks up when playing online through their Ubisoft servers. Watch dogs 1 did not have this issue, and checking the forums, I am far from alone, yet Ubisoft refuses to release a bug patch.
Overall, its one of my favorite games, which is why Im so frustrated when the game randomly locks up hard. I have also found that there doesnt seem to be a whole lot of people playing online.

58565,2280,1739,"This review is for the PS4 game of the year edition.

Even though it has been a long time since I played the original Dragon Age, it has stayed in my mind as a fun and memorable one.  Unfortunately, DA2 ended up as being a bit of a disappointment to me, losing some of the things that made the first DA memorable.  So I was a bit reluctant to get Inquisition as I was not sure if I would get a return to form or more of the same linear limited open world of DA2, but decided to take a chance after the price dropped to under 20 bucks.

Like the previous game, I was able to import the results from the previous games into Inquisition, which seems to affect the story a bit and character interactions, which is a nice touch to show the results of your previous games actions.  DA2 was a bit more action-oriented hack and slash kind of combat RPG, whereas DA was more of a traditional RPG with more dialogue and choices with dialogue that affects the game.  I personally preferred the gameplay of the first game than the hack and slash DA2.  Inquisition seems to have balanced that a bit more, bringing back some of the best elements of the first DA, but the combat seems to still mostly a hack and slash repeating tapping of buttons with little strategy.  Like DA2, I save often to avoid some combat frustration.

There is a bit more weapon and armor variety than in DA2 and you can even create weapons and armor with even more variation.  Like in DA2, the inventory and character menus are still a bit cumbersome to use as it is a bit of a burden to figure out which weapon/armor is best suited to the character with the same restrictions on certain weapons and armor that DA2 has.

The skill tree is back, but like DA2, it is a bit of a chore to navigate.  There are plenty of skills to choose from but I really would have liked if it was a bit more simplified that is easier to see on one screen versus the multiple you have to scroll through to find an ability you want.  As with DA2, you have a group of four characters in your party which should be diverse in order to successfully complete the various quests.

One of the best things of the first DA was the story, which I felt was lacking in DA2.  Fortunately, the story is much improved over DA2 with good characters and character interactions.

Considering this game is now 4 years old, the graphics are good and much better than the first two games, but still feel a bit dated compared to some of the newer games out now.  The various characters have good detail with smooth animation.  Like the previous games, there are camera glitches, especially during combat.  Some of the same sound glitches that have occurred in DA2, where there is no sound or doesnt match the characters, occur on occasion.  You would think that some of the bugs from the previous game would have been fixed for this one.

One of my big gripes with DA2 was the limited game world map that used the same areas with very little variety throughout the game.  Inquisition has a lot more depth with a variety of areas to explore.  There are still some limitations with the game world but the tremendous number of places to explore and things to do makes for a great improvement over DA2.  If anything, there may be too much to do and explore here.  There are also some new elements added such as the war table, similar to some of the AC games.  For me, I am not so sure I like that part of the game, but your actions open up new areas to explore, without having to navigate all over the map to find the areas.  As it is with games that have a lot of quests (main/side), some are more interesting than others and get a bit repetitive after a while.

There are plenty of interesting characters to interact with and the voice acting is good decent for the most part.  The various party members have different skill sets and background stories that are affected by your game decisions, which provides some depth to the game.

To me, the different menu interfaces seems a bit dated and could have been better done overall as it all seems a bit clunky in my opinion.

The game balance is better with lots of places to explore and a good story that is affected by the multiple character interactions.  Combat is a bit too simplified and there are some of the same glitches from the past games but overall is an improvement over DA2 and fun to play, but some quests are bland and monotonous.  To me, this is a decent game overall, but not as good as the first DA game and I like the Elder Scroll series a bit better.

58604,2872,4327,"A bad review of Breath of the Wild? This game is a final Wii U game, developed on this format so for the longest time it was called ""Zelda Wii U"" during pre-release  days. I have to say the fact that many first party Nintendo games are still full-priced at around $60 even after discontinuation of the system is enough reason for me to deduct a point from any of those games. Another star would of been deducted if this game had extensive DLC like other games these days... what you really get here is a $80 game considering the Expansion Pass you basically need to purchase separately to get the ""full experience""... Anyhow, I didn't deduct the points for the game's price, but more seriously because it doesn't feel like a true Zelda game to me. Zelda's in it and so is Link... but it's another one of those 1 player games trying to be an MMO by structuring itself with ""open world content"" games where you are lead by the nose by ""Missions"" rather than the game's over-arching plot. The problem being that getting lost is part of the game's forte. Link must procure items & weapons & clothing on-site. Basically find a sword somewhere, beat the monsters down til your weapon explodes from being destroyed and then grab a disarmed monster's club to beat him down with. There's some babble about Link having lost his memory (and possibly his mojo) but what I hate about this game is there's no dungeons. Dungeons make and break a Zelda game and the lack of them breaks this one. Another thing is the wolf-LInk amiibo. I'm not sure if the wolf-Link is an option in the Switch version since Twilight Princess wasn't released on that format so basically you cannot raise the HP of the wolf-Link companion....",bad review breath wild game final wii u game develop format longest time call zelda wii u prereleas day say fact mani first parti nintendo game still fullpric around 60 even discontinu system enough reason deduct point game anoth star would deduct game extens dlc like game day realli get 80 game consid expans pas basic need purchas separ get full experi anyhow didnt deduct point game price serious doesnt feel like true zelda game zelda link anoth one 1 player game tri mmo structur open world content game lead nose mission rather game overarch plot problem get lost part game fort link must procur item weapon cloth onsit basic find sword somewher beat monster til weapon explod destroy grab disarm monster club beat there babbl link lost memori possibl mojo hate game there dungeon dungeon make break zelda game lack break one anoth thing wolflink amiibo im sure wolflink option switch version sinc twilight princess wasnt releas format basic cannot rais,1530748800,3

Now i owned all of the Xbox consoles so i am very familiar with the stick layout but have zero issues with the dualshock 4 layout. Upon opening the Hori I wad not super impressed
 Yes i knew it was going to be light due to not having the vibration motors but it just seemed kinda cheap and plasticky.  Its similar to the 360 controller design and didn't feel that bad in my hands. Loaded up Fortnite and any negative feelings about the controller disappeared immediately.  The triggers despite how they appear in pictures work great.  I can swap weapons with L1 and R1 so much faster it isn't funny. Then the L2 and R2 have shorter travel distance than that of the dualshock 4 or my Scuf and makes it much easier to win gunfights.  My accuracy also seems much better this far. My kills per match has doubled easily. Also note there is no headphone jack but I use a wireless controller so i don't need it. And the instructions are in Japanese so you will need them translated to figure out the special buttons. Im not using them nor did i plan to so i haven't used rhe turbo feature. Still great controller for the price.
EDIT....forgot to mention that the cable is about 9ft long which is far too long for my desktop setup. I have it tied off so im not tripping on it

58618,8626,740,"I really want to like this mouse. I own a lot of gaming mice that I have purchased over the past two years. Probably more along the line of a dozen now. The G602 is just a ok mouse for gaming in my collection.

Here's why:
1) Its heavy and has a bigger handprint. To give you an idea, its much more heavier than a Logitech G502 (of which I also own). There is a lot of rubber making this heavier than plastic. The two batteries don't make it any lighter either. I'm not a fan of heavy mice as it creates hand fatigue for me.
2) The scroll wheel isn't anything like the G502. It doesn't spin freely and doesn't click firmly either. It has more of a loose spinning friction feel to it than a locking one.
3) The 6 side buttons are a little too small bezel wise and have a not so smooth edge feel to it. Its not bad, better than the MMO mice I have. However, what I don't like is the position of the buttons farthest to the foot of the mouse. They are way too far back. This causes me to reposition my hand to get to them and really kink my thumb backwards. In fast FPS games, this doesn't work well for me as my entire palm and fingers shift backward.
4) Scroll wheel clicks to the left and right side feel awkward and take too much effort to perform. This, unlike the G502 which is way easier.

What I like about it:
1) Losing the cord is great. I love not having it hit anything on my desk.
2) The rubber feet are very good too and glide easily.
3) The rubber top feels good and gives more grip than mice that use plastic tops at the palm

If Logitech could remove some of the rubber on this mouse and make it more lighter and change the position of the 6 side buttons to be moved farther up toward the front of the mouse by 1/2"", this would be a top 5 on my list. But as it stands, I can't give it that.

58624,501,4509,"Video games feature a wide variety of genres that cater to different players and playstyles. From the classic RPG mechanics inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and the like to fun hack n slash games meant to give you a sense of satisfaction from pulling off crazy combos, games are as diverse  if not more so  than any other art form. Heck, gaming probably features all the art forms that a movie has plus the ones that are exclusive to gaming. If a developer wants to make a thriller story like Silence of the Lambs but also throw in some classic platforming gameplay, nothing is stopping them. And while it is great that the medium can have such a diverse way of expressing itself, this also creates the problem of leading some people to become disappointed when a particular genre becomes too popular. For example, some people (such as myself) are not the biggest fan of battle royale multiplayer games like Fortnite, but I would take a PlayStation platformer like Spyro or Sly Cooper any day of the week. While this will always leave some disappointed, I think that it is best looked at through the lens of Well, at least some groups are happy.

This new God of War, developed by Sony Santa Monica Studio (who developed all the previous main titles in the series), marks quite the change for the beloved franchise. No longer are you playing as Kratos, a god seeking revenge in a fast-paced action-adventure hack n slash that lets players live out their wildest fantasies of slashing gods and titans; instead, you play as Kratos, a widower and father who is trying to live a simple life in a game that, while still featuring many combat scenarios, has a far greater emphasis on story, characters, and exploration than previous games. Ive read many discussion threads and articles online that praise this new direction the franchise is taking, but also quite a few that dismiss it because its not God of War. While I personally agree with the former, I think that it is best to discuss this game as its own being  it isn't a total reboot (this is the same Kratos in the same storyline), but it is certainly a rebirth of the franchise. And as far as the developers goal in trying to breathe new life into a series that some thought had its glory days behind it, they not only succeed but also create one of the most beautiful, touching, grand, and just plain fun experiences of this gaming generation. THIS is God of War

 Due to the popularity of the game and the amount of press it has already gotten (not to mention that this review is super late), Im not going to spend much time dwelling on the mechanics and common knowledge of the game. Its a third-person action-adventure game with a heavy focus on story and characters and exploration (like I said earlier) and features inspiration from many popular games, such as The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, Dark Souls, and probably dozens of others that I haven't had the chance to play. What makes this game so great is that it takes some of the best elements from each of these franchises and mixes it all together to create its own cohesive experience. For example, the over-the-shoulder camera and basic movement is clearly inspired by Naughty Dogs The Last of Us. This was probably done because that particular style helps with immersion greatly without going into full-out first-person mode. You could also say that having a strong focus on story, especially with a parental figure and child, is also reminiscent of that game. Thats great, seeing as how the main reason that The Last of Us is popular is because of its story and characters. But for those who didn't like The Last of Us (those heartless bastards), calling this game Dad of Us: God of War Meets The Last of Us, you're doing the game a great disservice.

 While Im confident in saying that the game developers did take note from The Last of Us, its not the only inspiration they took. The core combat system, which is decidedly different from past games, seems to take a Dark Souls-esque approach. Dont take that the wrong way, its not a copy-and-paste approach, as there are still over-the-top moves you can perform (including some sick finishers and powerful runic attacks), but the base system of blocking with your shield and parrying when an enemy attacks to get an opening gives you that similar feeling. This is most prevalent in the early segments of the game when your character isn't upgraded fully and you don't have access to dozens of powerful moves and while I absolutely love decimating my foes with those attacks, the beginning parts makes you take a step back and be cautious with your fights  the first true boss fight of the game is probably the most difficult part of the story because of this fact. You cant just button-mash your way to victory (at least not on normal difficulty) and I appreciated that thought put into the combat. I should mention, however, that because the combat takes this route while also utilizing a similar camera to The Last of Us, it can feel a little clunky at times and hard to control, especially in the beginning when you're still getting used to everything, but after getting a couple hours into the game, you start to get the hang of it and it should be (mostly) smooth sailing from there on out  no camera in a game is perfect, but I still very much enjoyed the combat here. But then theres the exploration.

 The game seems to be a balance between linear and nonlinear, and I don't think that it is fair to label it as either of them. To say that the game is a nonlinear open-world game isn't completely true, as its certainly no Elder Scrolls or GTA in this regard, but to say that it is a linear game like Uncharted or the previous games is also unfair, as there are plenty of optional areas to explore on your journey. In this regard, I find it similar to metroidvania games and the newer Tomb Raider games. I only played the 2013 one, but its similar in that there is a linear path that you can take for the story, but there are plenty of side areas to explore to fill your time (although this game has far more content than Tomb Raider). While I almost always prefer linear games over nonlinear ones (for many reasons that I don't want to get into for the sake of time), I find that this game does a nice balance of staying in the middle. The main story is obviously the selling point of the game and certainly met my expectations, but the side content is jolly good fun as well, especially since you can learn more about the world you inhabit by exploring various landscapes and discovering secret areas and lore markers. That being said, however, I must offer one of my nitpicks of the game: the pacing.

 One of the best parts about a linear game is that by focusing on a single path for the player, it is (usually) more focused and can allow for a great experience that doesnt get old too quickly, i.e., it has really good pacing and means you don't get bored. By having this game be a little more open-ended you get the benefit of having more replay value on a single playthrough, more places to visit, and more customizable options for your characters because you do more, but you sacrifice something that I think is more important: the pacing. One minute, you're battling giant creatures and experiencing a riveting father-son tale with spectacular set pieces and beautiful subtle moments and the next, you're doing slightly repetitive side quests so that you can upgrade your equipment and learn more about the world. Now I understand that the keyword here is that it is optional content that no one is forcing you to do right away, but the game seems to deliberately encourage you to explore  thats how you get some of the best loot in the game and there are even moments where Atreus (your son) specifically says lines like We should go exploring now. I know that not everyone will feel this way and many would probably think that Im nitpicking what isn't even a flaw, but its just something that I thought should be stated because it honestly bugged me a bit in my playthrough. But that being said, it is a super nitpick and I would like to get to the other important aspect of the game now: the story.

 God of War is yet another fantastic example for the argument of why video games are the best medium for presenting a story. Directed by Cory Balrog, the game continues the cinematic approach of the earlier games  however, instead of using the cinematic framework to create over-the-top moments with some decent story bits sprinkled here and there, they use the framework to create a more natural experience where it really lets the player feel like they are truly embarking on journey. As I stated earlier, the camera is a lot closer to Kratos this time around and by not having any camera cuts in the game, you are part of every step of Kratos journey as he and his son travel to the highest peak so that they may spread their mothers ashes. Although the game has its grand moments that harken back to past games, the game is a lot more subdued in its approach as some of the best moments are just the little things you notice. Walking through the forest, Atreus might pose a question and Kratos response alone can provide more character depth than entire cutscenes in the past games, which is a tribute to the writing of this game. I do think that by having many people (including myself) compare this game to The Last of Us, you might create expectations for what the story should be and while I personally don't think that it is quite as good, it is still a beautiful journey from beginning to end that, while not featuring the greatest story or characters in a game, still features some of my favorite.

 Perhaps most shockingly, Kratos is great. Before this game, I was not a huge fan of him as I felt that he was just an angry dude who blamed everyone else for his problems, but this game makes you genuinely care about this man and his path to not only being a good father to Atreus, but also to redemption (even if he doesnt realize it). Then theres Atreus who is a great sidekick to have around. Since Im already making comparisons, I supposed I should mention that hes not a copy-and-paste of Ellie, but he is certainly likeable and also very useful in combat  I don't know where Id be without his magic arrows. Theres plenty of other great side characters, but I don't want to give them all away  needless to say, I think that all of them were fantastic. My two favorite were the main villain (who is perfect as the jackass who you cant help but love watching on-screen) and a character who appears halfway through the game to help provide you with some information  hes both funny and great at imparting knowledge to you and your son. All the actors perform exceptionally well, but I want to give particular mention to Christopher Judge. Some were hesitant that he was taking over the role of Kratos from long-time actor Terrence C. Carson, but he does a fantastic job. I won't comment on who is better, as I think they both fit their respective eras very well, but for representing all that Kratos is (a man with a dark a past, a mourning husband, a trying father, an unbelievably strong god, etc.), he is nothing short of fantastic.

 Since this review is getting a little longer than I was originally planning, I would like to mention a small detail that many (including myself at one point) asked: Is it necessary to play the past games? While the game is marketed as taking a fresh start of the series and was developed with that attitude, I think that it is important to mention that this is still the same Kratos and while it doesnt continue from the exact point that God of War III left off, it is a continuation of the story of Kratos. Not every question is answered, but there are more than a couple callbacks to Kratos past that Im not sure would be appreciated if you didn't play the previous games. However, that being said, I think that it would be interesting to play the game without this outside knowledge because then you would be more curious about some aspects and see certain situations through the eyes of Atreus (which director Cory Balrog has mentioned as being a perfectly suitable experience). So, I guess my answer would be if you have access to the previous games and want to play them, play them first; but if you're not interested and just want to play this game, just jump into this one (or watch YouTube summaries of the previous games and then play this one if you want).

God of War is a great game. Its not for everyone, but no game is. Some longtime fans might be upset at the new direction of the series, but I think that most would agree that it helped to not only create an amazing experience that will stay in many a gamers mind for a long time to come, but also in revitalizing a treasured Sony franchise. While the game does have its own self-contained story that reaches a downright beautiful ending (one of my favorites from any game ever), it also leaves enough open-ended questions to leave room for the inevitable sequel. I tried not to give too much away for the game so that you can experience most of it for yourself without having anything spoiled for you, but rest assured, it lived up to the hype for me and was easily worth my $60. I don't want to get hopes up because I know that that can lead to disappointment, but I do recommend you buy the game and try it out without any hype. See for yourself if it lives up. All I can say is that I cant wait to see where the series goes next, but until then, I will be happy to experience this one a second time. This may be the fourth main game in the series, but for many, it is only the beginning

58641,2641,351,"This was my first real AC game (the other one I played before was AC4 Freedom Cry DLC which bugged halfway through and I got too irritated to play), and to be honest, I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it.  Especially since on other venues (like steam and all my friends), claimed that this was a subpar AC game compared to, say AC 4 Black Flag.

But honestly, this was an awesome game, and I had way too much fun playing it.  It wasn't ridiculously long (not JRPG level long), i completed it at around the 35hrs mark.  I did do a good chunk of the side content (including just running around collecting treasure chests), which probably prolonged the game because the story portion (and even the side character questlines) really weren't that long.  I think the complaint about it being too short could be true - but i wasn't looking for a pointlessly stretched out game, so it worked out.

Gameplay was the most fun part for me.  Exploring London was glorious, many of the locations were beautifully constructed, and the few times when the music kicks in (like at synchronize points or combat/events), they were really beautiful pieces that matched with the location.  The main characters were pretty good as well, relatively personable, although I find that I preferred Jacob over Evie - Jacob gave me a Tony Stark/Iron Man feel, whereas Evie is the more responsible one.  The feel of the time period really came through, from the different accents to the outfits, and the city of London feel very alive with the sheer number of NPCS (many of whom really gets in the way).  And I honestly cannot express how addictive the gameplay can get - i spent far too much time climbing around finding the treasure chests and helix pieces, as well as the other random collectibles around.  There is something incredibly addictive about collecting stuff in this game, and a lot of times it works out like jumping puzzles as well, it's so awesome.

Also, the controls are really great (especially now that i've tried AC4 Black Flag and wants to throw my controller at the wall).  Now that i've tried AC4, i could cry at how the characters actually, you know, sticks to the wall and doesn't randomly jump off for no bloody reason.

the story isn't out of this world awesome, but it wasn't bad.  my only gripe was that the writer seemed to have had some issues with figuring out who they wanted as the main character (or trying to make both the main character but failing at it).  most of the story missions were with Jacob (and overall it felt like he did ""more"" in the overall scheme of the story), but then after Jacob does the task he was assigned in his chapter, next chapter Evie gets told that supposedly what Jacob did was bad, and now she have to wipe us his mess.  it was...really awkwardly done, if they wanted to go that path, they should've showed some of the ""chaos left behind by Jacob"" at the end of his own missions/chapters.  As it is, it felt rather disjointed.  And Evie's role in the game, despite supposedly focused on finding the shroud, really spent more time ""wiping up Jacob's mess"", with very few missions actually dedicated to what she wanted to pursue.  However, as a whole, i find the story to be good/great, and what i enjoyed the most about the map-based sidequests (ie saving children from child labor or destroying a blighter stronghold), is that it feels like i'm actively working toward the goal of the main plot even while doing the rando side stuff - which was clearing the Blighter control in London.

Honestly, i was really surprised and impressed with what I saw.  it made me want to play all the other AC games that came before (especially the ones that were rated better).  HOWEVER I started AC4 and hoo boy, let's just say i'm getting nowhere in that game and i'm giving up.  So after that terrible experience (despite AC4 getting high acclaim from everyone), i'm going to say that I really prefer AC Syndicate over the past games (at least the ones i've tried).

58645,9068,452,"(First, a word about this particular edition: whereby the vanilla version of this game would receive four stars, this one gets five. The DLCs have so much satisfying content and the main game is given a drizzle of extra lore that fits comfortably with the rest of the narrative. Also, there's an optional final boss added. We all want that.)
The fire is fading in the kingdom of Drangleic. The gods have all vanished and the whole land is in considerable decay; humans, all in various stages of hollowing or corruption, wander this world in search of purpose, alone under the dragon-dotted sky. Or are they? Perhaps there are other manifestations of the Dark still lurking in the shadows of Vendrick's kingdom. This kingdom, by the way, while not as impressively laid out as Lordran from the first game, does not fall short in creativity. To be honest, this might be my favorite Soulsborne game (specifically this edition). There's more content in it than any of the other games, both in terms of equipment and the number of areas to explore. True enough, it is graphically the least impressive but, mechanically, it has the soundest inventory system by far and some really terrific customization. Combat is much harder to get used to but, man...get your hands on an ultra-greatsword first chance you get.
People throw a lot of shade on this game. ""Hollowing is done badly""; it's still better than how it is in Demon's Souls and Darks Souls 3. ""You can't farm enemies as much""; burn bonfire ascetics or go to another area--there are plenty. ""Too many humanoid enemies""; well, it's consistent with the story--play Bloodborne if you want more beasts.

58697,751,431,"Dragon Age Inquisition is a game I have mixed feelings for. It has a lot of potential, which unfortunately was held back by a simultaneous release for the PS3 and Xbox360. I think if the game was developed solely for current gen consoles, most of the issues wouldnt exist  muddy textures, graphical bugs, lag, audio sync issues, etc.  But before I get into my dislikes and nit picks, lets talk about the things I DID enjoy.

1. Voice acting is well done. Obviously the background banter and lesser NPCs aren't anything to be impressed about, but talking to party members or other main characters, the delivery is good.

2. I think making the attack button a trigger button instead of X or [ ], is a pretty neat idea. Obviously they needed to free up the face buttons for spells, so it makes sense

3. Being able to switch to multiple characters on the field and having additional party members to sub in and out is nice. It is fun to be able to switch to a ranged character if you are more of a melee build.

4. The story for the most part is fine. There is a time travel section that I enjoyed a lot. Base story isn't overly convoluted, which helps when you come back after long gaps in your play time.

5. Romancing your party members is fun and totally worth it just for Cassandra alone. Her arc is delightful.

Now let me break down some of the neutral or nitpicky stuff.

1. Models seem overall stiff when compared to other RPGs of the time  Witcher 3 for example. Pretty sure this is due to last gen development - so models, textures, etc, had to be kept simpler.

2. There are instances where items will pass through characters body as they are talking. For instance, Dorian has a staff and when you are introduced to him, he has a long dialog section where he gestures with his hand so the staff he is holding clips through his body constantly. Looks messy. Also a couple of times characters would be missing shoulders or small parts of their arms during dialog sections.

3. Dialog choices often times seems to have no consequence to the story. Sure your party member may not enjoy you being rude to that elf, but nothing bad will directly happen because of it. Something The Witcher 3 does much better.

4. Many times you will walk through areas with people and you won't hear them talk. Often enough they are just standing around like statues and not on any sort of loop. Again, witcher 3 does this better.

5. The horse is ok I guess, except for when you want to go fast. You hit L3 and you get a blurry, zoomed view that SEEMS like you are going faster, but honestly just kind of makes me nauseous.

6. Way too many side quests that require you to fetch animal hides, or flowers, or other crafting material. You will waste a lot of playtime not actually DOING anything.
7. Speaking of crafting mats, anytime you want to upgrade your potions you need about 30 of some plant, and you will be wandering around looking for it and waiting for nodes to respawn. If I wanted to play WOW I would.

Now for the truly heinous parts of the game

1. The war table is ok in theory, but realistically it is designed to waste your time. As you complete quests you are awarded points to use toward your war table actions. The table will give you options of what to pursue with different point allocation to unlock it  perhaps you are awarded some gold, some influence, or a new area is unlocked. Typically the points to accept the missions range from 10  30. So you need to work on the side quests to get a few points to do anything at the war table. Even then, there is a timer for each mission. Sometimes it is fast 10 minutes, other times it can be an hour. So then you have to wait. Boy thats fun.

2. Speaking of wasting your time. The game LOVES to make your exploration very difficult. Paths to your quest destination are very obtuse and often blocked by a cliff or invisible barrier. So you have to go ALL THE WAY AROUND instead of trying to hop up some seemingly reachable stone steps. It would be a lot easier if your character had some sort of grab animation to pull him up on a ledge. Instead you are left with a pathetic jump. (witcher 3 was better)

3. Lag. Oh goodness the lag. Unavoidable. If you play on xbox X or on a PS4 Pro you will be lucky to get a solid 30 FPS (not even 60, boooo), but on a base console, you will typically lose about 3-5 frames in just about any situation or environment. I can live with that for the most part. But I have experienced lag so bad, it made me want to stop playing. In Skyhold, my game dropped to the teens, easily. It made dialog audio out of sync and ruined a lot of neat cut scenes. Thankfully, after I quick travelled to the Hinterlands, it seemed to sort itself out. HOWEVER, the WORST was yet to come. I had lag in the Exalted Plains SO TERRIBLY AWFUL STINKING BAD that my game turned into a slideshow. No kidding. Single digit frames. So so so so bad. Going into my options was brutal and made playing the game impossible as you need to be able to react to attacks. I don't know what causes it, but I haven't seen lag that bad since playing Fallout New Vegas on PS3. Yes, that bad.

So as you can see, the game leaves a weird taste in my mouth. There are a lot of things that are simply done better in Witcher 3, and I would just recommend playing that, it is amazing.  If this game was developed for newer hardware, it could have been a 4 star game, easily. But the fact that the last gen held it back puts it at 3. The lag hurts it even further and drops it to 2 stars. But if you are a fan of the series and want more Dragon Age, then get it on the cheap. Anything under 20 bucks seems reasonable.",dragon age inquisit game mix feel lot potenti unfortun held back simultan releas ps3 xbox360 think game develop sole current gen consol issu wouldnt exist muddi textur graphic bug lag audio sync issu etc get dislik nit pick let talk thing enjoy 1 voic act well done obvious background banter lesser npc arent anyth impress talk parti member main charact deliveri good 2 think make attack button trigger button instead x pretti neat idea obvious need free face button spell make sen 3 abl switch multipl charact field addit parti member sub nice fun abl switch rang charact mele build 4 stori part fine time travel section enjoy lot base stori isnt overli convolut help come back long gap play time 5 romanc parti member fun total worth cassandra alon arc delight let break neutral nitpicki stuff 1 model seem overal stiff compar rpg time witcher 3 exampl pretti sure due last gen develop model textur etc kept simpler 2 instanc item pas charact bodi,1531353600,2

58718,7584,2337,"I owned the LS20 model last year and was super impressed so I wanted to try the big brother for my PS4. The headset came with all the accessories in the original box.
First, they're comfortable. Very comfortable. I had them on for a 5 hour Fortnite session with my son and they never became noticeable in a bad way.
The wireless signal never dropped or became weak, it was as if I was wearing a wired set.
The audio...wow. The audio is amazing and the presets are simple but effective - normal, bass boost, and treble boost. All have their own uses depending on the game or music you're playing. But the sound was crystal clear and made me very happy indeed.
The controls are easy to use as they consist of big buttons built into the cups. Just push to change the presets, or to mute the mic. There are also knobs on the outside of the cups for game and chat volumes which can be set separately from one another.
They're metal and leather, and feel super durable and solid. Not like my old plastic Turtle Beach sets that felt like a child's toy (and broke just as easily).
All in all these things are epic, really. I've used numerous types of phones for gaming, recording music, podcasts, and listening to music, and these might not be the absolute best but for the price and the compatibility, and above all the audio and unique build /design...these are the best kept secret in headphones in my opinion.",own ls20 model last year super impress want tri big brother ps4 headset came accessori origin box first theyr comfort comfort 5 hour fortnit session son never becam notic bad way wireless signal never drop becam weak wear wire set audiowow audio amaz preset simpl effect normal bass boost trebl boost use depend game music your play sound crystal clear made happi inde control easi use consist big button built cup push chang preset mute mic also knob outsid cup game chat volum set separ one anoth theyr metal leather feel super durabl solid like old plastic turtl beach set felt like child toy broke easili thing epic realli ive use numer type phone game record music podcast listen music might absolut best price compat audio uniqu build designthes best kept secret headphon opinion,1531612800,5

58771,2647,1356,"I'll give more details below but lets start off with the Important stuff first.

Pros:
-Sexy looking design/color (white)
-Great build quality
-RGB lighting, and software customization options for it are great
-Software is easy to us, and offers great personalized options
-clicks nicely, and all clicks feel nice

Cons:
-Heavy as hell (even with weights/screws taken off)
-A bit wide, not very ergonomic, and uncomfortable to use even for a short time to me
-Not as accurate as it should be, especially for a mouse that's designed for FPS players
-Sniper button is kinda useless to me, and not in an ideal spot
-Unbalanced feel
-I paid $60 (better mice in this price point)

I really wanted to like this mouse more. I'll admit that I bought it because it was great looking, and it matched my PC build in White, and the RGB was a nice touch. I play a lot of First Person Perspective games, and I find this mouse to strain my hand/wrist pretty fast. While playing PUBG I notice when trying to get that accurate shot off, the mouse isn't as smooth, and accurate as you would think it would be...especially considering it has a ""sniper"" button that I never used. The scroll wheel, clickers, and all the other buttons are fantastic. Feel responsive, and did I mention it looks dead sexy sitting on my desk as I look at it. I just cant help but be disappointed it mostly how uncomfortable it is for my personal claw grip, and what put over the edge from great to just decent is the fact that pinpoint shooting accuracy is just not great. Picking up the mouse is freaking heavy too. It just went on sale on amazon for $35 and while that is a great price for a mouse like this. I paid $60, and feel like $35 is a more appropriate price for this. I'll be buying the logitech to replace this one.",ill give detail let start import stuff first pro sexi look designcolor white great build qualiti rgb light softwar custom option great softwar easi u offer great person option click nice click feel nice con heavi hell even weightsscrew taken bit wide ergonom uncomfort use even short time accur especi mous that design fp player sniper button kinda useless ideal spot unbalanc feel paid 60 better mouse price point realli want like mous ill admit bought great look match pc build white rgb nice touch play lot first person perspect game find mous strain handwrist pretti fast play pubg notic tri get accur shot mous isnt smooth accur would think would beespeci consid sniper button never use scroll wheel clicker button fantast feel respons mention look dead sexi sit desk look cant help disappoint mostli uncomfort person claw grip put edg great decent fact pinpoint shoot accuraci great pick mous freak heavi went sale amazon 35 great price,1531872000,3

I haven't had this happen before but I have had other issues similar to this with a UPS delivery person. The odd thing was that the sticker on the package had a USPS delivery person's last name on it, which was ""Diaz"". I'm not sure why that was, but it was definitely there. Now, with all of that being said, the game itself was still in pristine condition & is definitely playable. Item arrived on time & was definitely reminiscent of the original Resident Evil games of the past & had some new twists & features that others seem to lack in.

We are getting megaman 11 and MAYBE even a new Megaman X game. So regardless of capcoms practices, just suck it up so we can save the megaman series to continue with the future to show that hey we still love megaman.

Pretty much has the same features as the Megaman legacy collection for the switch, this time there is only a few new featues.

The megaman x series has always held a special place in my heart, I love megaman sure but the X series was like the edgy megaman. It was so dark and gritty for a megaman game, compared to the others. Zero is my favorite character, he is a cool character and even had his own series on the GBA. Megamans X desgin is also my favorite, overall this is a great series. I really wish I had some kind of megaman x figure.

New features are Ok, the most noticeable feature is the new X challenge mode where you can fight two bosses at once, yikes. There is also an animated prequel film called ""The Day of { ""

58842,4,4516,"This is the one I've been waiting for! I love the Mega Man X games! The first Mega Man legacy collection was fun and I enjoyed seeing the NES games agian, but they're really dated. My kids would barely even look at them... This X collection is fun for me, and my son is having a lot of fun with it too!! It looses a star because of some technical issues on the Switch, but I love these games and certainly suggest them!

These are some of the best run and gun platform games ever. The fact that you can beat the bosses and take their weapons was a very unique gimmick that added to the gameplay. It's also really awesome that you can play the stages in whatever order you want. And you get eight complete Mega Man X games here so you get a ton of great games! From best to worst, I would number these: X1, X2, X4, X5, X3, X8, X6, and X7. The earlier ones are definitely better, and X7 isn't worth playing. In fact, if you don't want the whole series, you can buy just the first half digitally for half the price.

Pros:
-You get all 8 of the main games in one collection. You don't get the two gameboy games, but they were pretty poor games anyway.
-The controls are very good and it's totally playable in handheld or tv mode. I like it with the pro controller a lot better, but I've enjoyed it on the go also.
-they brought the achievement system to the Switch and call them ""medals"".
-The rookie Hunter mode has made it easier for my younger kids to play.
-There is a boss rush mode that doesn't seem to be amazing, but the extra is nice.
-the art and music galleries are interesting to go through at least once.

Cons:
-X5 thorugh X8 are a digital download code and not on the cartridge. I don't know if it's the cartridge cost or just to kill resale value. Either way, it means I can't play the full series on both my Switch and my kids' Switch! Yes, X6 and X7 aren't worth playing, but I bought physical because I want physical!
-There's framerate stuttering on X1-X3. It's occasional and doesn't kill playability, but it shouldn't be there. There also is emulated slowdown that originally was on the SNES too. I would have liked to see that taken out too, but I understand it's intentional.
-no save state support. You can only save between stages. It makes it closer to the original password function, but I would have loved a save anywhere approach--especially when playing on the go! It's worked pretty well to just pause the game and put the Switch to sleep.

They're not perfect, but this is a great collection. Overall, this is awesome for a Meg Man X fan. I also think it's a much better introduction to the series than the original legacy collection. The Switch version has a stutter that I hope gets fixed, but I love having these games on the go.",one ive wait love mega man x game first mega man legaci collect fun enjoy see ne game agian theyr realli date kid would bare even look x collect fun son lot fun loo star technic issu switch love game certainli suggest best run gun platform game ever fact beat bos take weapon uniqu gimmick ad gameplay also realli awesom play stage whatev order want get eight complet mega man x game get ton great game best worst would number x1 x2 x4 x5 x3 x8 x6 x7 earlier one definit better x7 isnt worth play fact dont want whole seri buy first half digit half price pro get 8 main game one collect dont get two gameboy game pretti poor game anyway control good total playabl handheld tv mode like pro control lot better ive enjoy go also brought achiev system switch call medal rooki hunter mode made easier younger kid play bos rush mode doesnt seem amaz extra nice,1532390400,5

There's times when someone has been mowing the lawn outside, or I've had a fan on, and it's cool to be able to quickly adjust so the mic doesn't pick that stuff up. Also, the mic monitoring is great! I hate playing games with people who have no idea how they are sounding, and what their mic is actually picking up and broadcasting to everyone. This makes me into a more polite professional gamer. Also being able to quickly prioritize voice chat over game audio, Or mute either one all together is perfect! It's annoying talking with your friends and having to put up with loud game audio, or music when you load your game or sit at the menu. No longer do you have to fumble around in the game settings, only to figure out you can't change the title menu music. This device solves it all. Now for the neutral and negative parts: The price obviously is one. Another is that this seems like it was best designed for PC gaming. The reason I say that is because it's annoying having to stretch the USB and fiber optic cables across your living room, worry about stepping on the fiber optic cable, and having to put it away carefully when your done. Also, I don't like having to switch the cables from Xbox to PS4 all the time. I'd keep the fiber optic plugged into my TV, but then there's a slight audio delay from having to route the audio to an extra place. Yes, I know I'm very lucky to have two console's, but still! Just because of the cables, I think this device is best used at a desk with a PC. But, I still love it.

Not good at all, but unless you're constantly sticking your nose in it,  you probably won't notice. The removable liner was tight and hard to get the 3ds into. It's not even worth using, as it doesn't fully cover the 3ds, and the system should be just fine in the main case without it. Plus, the memory card holder flap is soft and rests in between the system and accessory pocket. It was very hard to get the game cartridges to fit in the slots though...

58860,831,4114,"Stuck in almost 10 years of development hell, I never thought this game would be released. Excited to finally get my hands on it, I dove in this past week and ended up binging it all the way through.

The follow up to Shadow of Colossus and ICO has improved upon its predecessors in many ways in narration, graphics, and story. The interactions with Trico, your bird-dog friend, are incredibly believable and life-like. I've never felt such a strong attachment to a virtual animal before. They really nailed the animations and AI on Trico.

Unfortunately, it also suffers from the same glaring issue in all 3 titles: the controls. The control scheme is so incredibly awkward and frustrating at times that it can really hold the game back. If you can power through it and train your brain to it it's not so bad but it does take some patience.

Looking past the control issues, The Last Guardian is an incredibly unique game with a touching story filled with many jaw-dropping moments. It doesn't have the prettiest graphics or stable framerate but it makes up for it with life-like animations and an interesting story that starts off slow and goes out with a bang. One of the most unique games of this console generation.

8/10

Final Verdict:  Looking past the controls, it's a unique slow-burn experience that requires dedication but pays off in the end with an unbelievably life-like attachment to a pixelated animal companion.",stuck almost 10 year develop hell never thought game would releas excit final get hand dove past week end bing way follow shadow colossu ico improv upon predecessor mani way narrat graphic stori interact trico birddog friend incred believ lifelik ive never felt strong attach virtual anim realli nail anim ai trico unfortun also suffer glare issu 3 titl control control scheme incred awkward frustrat time realli hold game back power train brain bad take patienc look past control issu last guardian incred uniqu game touch stori fill mani jawdrop moment doesnt prettiest graphic stabl framer make lifelik anim interest stori start slow goe bang one uniqu game consol gener 810 final verdict look past control uniqu slowburn experi requir dedic pay end unbeliev lifelik attach pixel anim companion,1532476800,4

58864,1182,4516,"I've played these games for a long time now, whether it's the originals on their respective platform, a collection that was on PS2 or this Switch version. This collection is alright and if all you're looking for is the Mega Man X games in a 'singe' collection. However if you have concerns about accuracy or if this is the best place for your nostalgia hit? Well stick around.

The issues:
First of all, yes it's true that the version to hit the US doesn't come with all the games on one or two cartridges, the first collection X1-4 comes on the first cartridge and 5-8 are downloaded. Why? Well there's plenty of reasons, only one who benefits from this is Capcom. You have access to both the western and Japanese versions of the games- for the most part. Games will be in japanese and will have the japanese audio- except for the openings where they will only be the western intros music.
Why are these important to bring up? Because Japan have access to a version that comes with 2 cartridges or you can buy an individual collection on a cartridge. Japanese version also has access to both audio tracks including the Japanese sung intros.

Which version of Mega Man X3 do you get? The super Nintendo one, no option for the PS/Saturn version. You get no options there so that's up to you if that's a positive or negative.
X4 is the PS version, so it will lack some of the unique features of the saturn version that...most people probably wouldn't notice.

They have not altered X5 or 6, meaning they're still as flawed as ever. ""But, why would they? They aren't looking to alter these games"" now that's what I thought but they have altered all of the games to some extent. They added a Rookie Hunter mode making the games massively easier, you take less damage, bosses take more. In the PS1 titles if you fall in a pit you'll teleport out and spikes won't kill you instantly....

Also, Mega Man X4 has been altered, specifically the intro. They have darkened at least 2 scenes to help with epilepsy - which is a waste of time since the rest of the game's cutscenes and gameplay still feature a lot of flashing lights. So they simply made the intro look worse with no option to change it. Also, they censored the intro. There's a salute the reploids do at t he start that might make one think of a ...'certain' salute. So they awkwardly edited the video and it's obvious where. This is something that is left in the PS2/GC version and the PSN version so altering it here is ...odd.

So, yes they went out of their way to edit these games, but not edit out some problems like: X5's annoyance of Alia nor the awful translation of X6. X5's lack of alteration is really grating since the support character will actively stop you, FREQUENTLY in the game to tell you stuff that you already know from playing the other games, leaving you to hammer the buttons to try and get through her tedious dialog. In later games you had the option to listen, in X5 you are entirely stuck. This is the biggest flaw of this game. X6's awful dialog doesn't change the gameplay so it's not as bad in my opinion. Well, honestly I think X6 is a terrible game so it requires a lot more than a slight fix to be good.

So, minus the changes above you are pretty much getting the experience you'd get  on their original platforms. Which is a mixed bag depending on who you ask:

There's a PS2/GC collection that has X1-6 on 1 collection that have all of the slow-down removed, have superior save functions for the SNES titles. Those versions however don't play nice with component cables or modern TVs.
The save functions on THIS X-Collection for the SNES titles simply save your password for you vs the X collection on PS2 that let you save your game like the PS1 titles. Meaning there's some things that you can't save. Energy tanks have to be refilled, hadoken has to be reacquired.

So, that was a lot of negatives and nitpicks. So what's good?
Well the load times are massively shorter, you get a few visual options that include a CRT-filter which looks pretty good, unfiltered pixels which is arguably best and a really awful filter that tries to smooth the pixels, there's a number of border options that you can have or not use. The games are very responsive and play well on the Switch. The games look really nice on a big screen TV and portable mode (the SNES games are not in the proper aspect ratio, they're 4:3 instead of 5:8, yes, that is what they're supposed to be, deal breaker? Not at all)

They've added achievements (even in the Switch version) if you're into that.

X-Challenge mode is pretty neat but isn't as fleshed out as it could be.
What it is: You have to fight 2 bosses at a time from X1-6, 3 in a row with 3 powers that you pick. It's pretty cool having to fight 2 bosses, and challenging. What surprised me is you can't pick who you fight, all of the fights are set and there's bosses that you'll see more frequently than others. Bosses can take a lot more damage than they did previously. You can ONLY play this as X, unarmored X IS an option but you can't select any powers.
Some of the fights are very, very, VERY hard, even on normal mode. They have High Max and Vile in one fight- High Max being one of the most lengthy, tedious, difficult fights in X6, never mind pairing him up with another maverick.
Also, the armor you get in this mode is obviously the 4th armor with a really, janky recoloring- it looks awesome in the artwork and the sprite just doesn't look good.

Ahem, positives. It's a really nice extra that lets you fight pretty hard boss fights, some very hard that adds even more replay value to this collection. There's a lot of fights, and they're different on each collection giving you a reason to want the other half of the collection that you download.

There's a TON of extras, TONS. See photos of merchandise sold in japan, listen to soundtracks from all the games, see commercials (they cut all the ones that had japanese singing, so, the cool animated ones), see tons of high-res artwork, play on easy mode for those who find these games hard or those who want to get someone who's not super good at games! It comes with the (non-canon) Day of Sigma anime on BOTH collections, up-scaled from the PSP.

*It's non-canon because the idea was to retell the story through remakes on the PSP, only one was made and the events are so different they don't line up with the series anymore

My other thoughts:
It's a pretty decent collection with the biggest flaw being (this is my opinion here, you may feel differently) that X3, 6,7 are not great games, X6 and X7 being very bad and X5 and X8 is only alright in my mind. X1,2,4 being the games I want out of this making half the collection mostly useless to me.
Those games are ported well enough with a few flaws that are related to presentation, not gameplay. Yes the PS2 collection had no slowdown but the originals did so while it may not match smooth 60fps it does match the originals so you can only knock it so much. I'm happy that it comes with the japanese versions so I can play X4 without the ....awful/charming voice work.

The games I really like are (as I've said) X1,2,4 and X5 is ...alright as is X8.
The bad:
-X3 tries to add a lot of new ideas, but none of them are fleshed out enough or featured long enough to say they were worth it- or good at all.
-X6 is just a bad game. The level design is very mediocre and often have invincible enemies in chokepoints that you either have to wait for them to be vulnerable to attack or damage boost through them.  Music drones a lot, bosses are very brain dead and deal out a LOT of contact damage to make up for it. There's a lot wrong with this game, including some bugs that make some power ups less useful than they should be.
-X7 is arguably worse. Uses generic sound effect, music isn't great, the jump to 3D was poorly handled and the english voicework is grating. The janky gameplay extends to levels, bosses and characters. You also have to unlock X to play... You're stuck with Axl who's annoying and his unique ability is tedious and terrible and all the unlocks you get TILL you get X do not go to him. It's not a good game.
-X5's biggest flaw is Alia, a support character that does, not, shut, up. She stops you from moving and tells you obvious things. Can't turn her off. Some of the level design isn't super great either and the way you get armor in this version makes the game needlessly padded. But overall? It's an alright game ..just buried under problems.
-X8 is alright, the issues are hard to directly point out. There's some bad levels (the flying level) but the rest of the levels are alright peppered with weird rooms that lock up and force you to fight a bunch of enemies before moving on. I think this is to mask a load? You can switch in level between 2 of 3 characters allowing some good replayability. Music is way better in spots than X7 (Jacob elevator!!) but the sound effects are also way generic here. Again it's not a bad game just not as polished as previous games..

X1 is an amazing game, does a lot right and not a lot wrong. Starts out slow with no dash but you unlock that in the 2nd level you play and it's just a well designed game from start to finish.
X2 is nearly as good, more difficult than X1 with more bosses to battle (or optionally battle!).  It's really well done.
X4 is another amazing game, 2 characters with 2 wildly different gameplay styles. Fight from a distance and get more (optional!)  upgrades with X, or get aggressive and upclose with Zero. The game can be a bit easy if you're going for the upgrades but, hey a lot of them are optional.

What would I have added?
-The option to play Mega Man X3's PS1 version or at the very least the cinematics from the game as there were quite a few.
-I'd really have liked the japanese versions to have the original japanese intros, licensing aside it's annoying they're not there, the same with the commercials as they were animated and looked really neat and are a rare sight to see here in the US.
-Maverick Hunter X would have been a great addition since it's a really good remake and has a lot of nice extras in it. They managed to get X8 on there, so it would have worked as well- AND would have made the 2nd half of the collection more worth it since 2 of the 4 games are not great.

The Switch gets the short straw, here in the US anyway since I heard the PS4/XB1 versions come with another disc while we're left to download the rest. Since the Switch is region free you could hypothetically look up the Japanese version to get both carts and play that with all the missing stuff I listed in this stupidly long review.

Is this collection good? Yeah it's pretty darn good. Is it worth your money; arguable since half is a download and some of the games aren't great. X1,2,4 are great games, the challenge mode is pretty neat and all the artwork they include is a ton of extras dropped in your lap for a decent price.  There's flaws for certain but that's why I typed everything I could think up so you can figure out if this is for you.

Edit: There's also some bugs at the time of writing this. My cousin has gotten the game to soft lock twice with X7 where the boss VANISHES as do the character limbs randomly. Not good, but neither is the game so it's not going to catch that many people I'm sure.
X2, when you rescue Zero and he attacks Sigma he HITS YOU in the cutscene!

58873,6210,3924,"I am really enjoying this game and I really didn't think I would.

I bought this game only for the single player campaign and because it was only 10 bucks on amazon and I am happily surprised by both the gameplay and story. Well, okay, I shouldn't say the ""story"" is good, it's just some Sci. Fi. B.S. Briefly, there's a war or something going on and you are normally a rifleman that wants to be a pilot (of the big mechs called titans) and then becomes a pilot due to the death of the previous pilot (a promotion is a promotion, I guess). You then become responsible for finishing up the mission of another pilot that also died because the bar for pilot admission is apparently very low.

The shooting is pretty good but, and this has been talked about before, the movement is the most fun. Pilots get these jump packs which allow them to do extended wall runs and double jumps and this turns every fighting area into a giant fun house. It also begs the question why wouldn't...the...uh... ""good guys"" just give all their combatants the jump packs? Wouldn't that mean your fighting force, titan or no, would be more effective? Just saying. Anyway, running around the map like a methed out squirrel is always fun, but I do feel that sometimes the movement feels a bit uncontrollable which makes going right where I want to go a bit tricky. Then again, I can't imagine moving like that would be very controllable anyway.

My only issue is that sometimes I get audio clipping when there is a lot of gunfire/explosions happening simultaneously. The only issue is that it can make locating gunfire difficult as I use headphones to help me locate enemies.

Still fun and would heavily recommend to anyone that likes shooting stuff, sci fi, shooting stuff in sci fi, big robots, and defying gravity (so, basically, every kid ever).",realli enjoy game realli didnt think would bought game singl player campaign 10 buck amazon happili surpris gameplay stori well okay shouldnt say stori good sci fi b briefli there war someth go normal rifleman want pilot big mech call titan becom pilot due death previou pilot promot promot guess becom respons finish mission anoth pilot also die bar pilot admiss appar low shoot pretti good talk movement fun pilot get jump pack allow extend wall run doubl jump turn everi fight area giant fun hous also beg question wouldnttheuh good guy give combat jump pack wouldnt mean fight forc titan would effect say anyway run around map like meth squirrel alway fun feel sometim movement feel bit uncontrol make go right want go bit tricki cant imagin move like would control anyway issu sometim get audio clip lot gunfireexplos happen simultan issu make locat gunfir difficult use headphon help locat enemi still fun would,1532649600,5

Sound quality is good! Occasional pop when going from complete silence to loud sound. More than ample quality, though, for the price range. Strong bass, good range. Decent noise-canceling, too.

59086,7969,603,"Years ago I happened to run across trigger treadz while looking for controller upgrades. At just $8 we rolled the dice. Me and my kids are so happy we did. These helped us to complete the rubberizion of our controllers. If you can put a sticker on something then you can add this mod. The rubber these are made with is perfect. Soft but not sponge feeling. Both the tread pattern and the rubber itself contribute equally to give you a comfortable grip. As a added bonus they will not make you sweat preserving the killer grip during all long night/day gaming sessions. Every new controller we buy gets these first thing before it's used. The 4 star instead of 5 is for two issues. The minor issue is over the availability. These are not easy to find except in England. When they are available in the states it has always taken a good while before delivered. So hard in fact my family keeps 1 spare pack at all times. The major issue is over like everything else don't last forever. Even when that is expected the rubber is not the issue that ends up retiring a pair. The sticky is the issue. Although at first they adhere well and will not fall off or move. Over time the adhesive fails and the tread starts to peel off. Once it starts to peel it is going to fall off. I've tried everything even the dumb idea of super glue ""DONT DO IT"". Finally I found gorilla glue double sided mounting tape works like a dream. A year later still there instead of replacing them every 3 or 4 months. The tape is thick so it does raise them up off the trigger about 3x. This not only adheres better and longer but actually improves the product across the board. The thickness of the gorilla tape makes it give just enough to make it form a little to around your finger kinda like hard memory foam. This greatly improves the comfort and grip to go along with the added life from better adhesive. Anyone who buys these I'd highly recommend the gorilla tape day one cause it makes it better in every way over the stock adhesive. You cannot go wrong purchasing these.",year ago happen run across trigger treadz look control upgrad 8 roll dice kid happi help u complet rubberizion control put sticker someth add mod rubber made perfect soft spong feel tread pattern rubber contribut equal give comfort grip ad bonu make sweat preserv killer grip long nightday game session everi new control buy get first thing use 4 star instead 5 two issu minor issu avail easi find except england avail state alway taken good deliv hard fact famili keep 1 spare pack time major issu like everyth el dont last forev even expect rubber issu end retir pair sticki issu although first adher well fall move time adhes fail tread start peel start peel go fall ive tri everyth even dumb idea super glue dont final found gorilla glue doubl side mount tape work like dream year later still instead replac everi 3 4 month tape thick rais trigger 3x adher better,1533340800,4

59091,2280,4320,"This review is for the PS4 version.

After recently finishing DA: Inquisition and dealing with some of the frustrations of the gameplay in terms of the environment and character movement, the smoothness of the game world and character movement felt refreshing with this game.  HZD feels in a lot of ways similar to the Far Cry games with a bit of FC Primal and Witcher mixed in.  I am a fan of that series, recently completing Primal.  So if you like FC, especially Primal, you will most likely like HZD.

The graphics are some of the best I have seen on the PS4, with beautiful scenery, water features that look nearly real, and detailed environments and creatures.  The gameplay feels so smooth and easy to use as compared to my recent experience with DA.  In a lot of respects, the gameplay style is similar to my experience in the FC series, in terms of how you play the game.

The game world is a large open world with a lot of different things to explore and experience.  I was not a bit fan of the method of fast travel that the game has as well as the save point locations, but those complaints are really minor.

Probably my biggest complaint of the game is that the menus feel a bit cluttered and could have been better organized to make it easier to find the things you are looking to do.  The game also doesnt always explain well how to do certain things as well, which was a bit of an annoyance to me at times.

The story is a decent one, although could have been executed a bit better.  I think the game tends to rely on finding information on audio and documents a bit too much and leaves conversations a bit sparse among some of the characters in the game.

As it is with these games, some of the side and collecting quests get old pretty quickly.

Even with some of its shortcomings, the pros far outweigh the cons and I am enjoying this game.

59092,2901,3589,"I think I originally began playing Bioshock several years ago, but wasn't leveled up enough or didn't have enough ammo.  I remember reaching a point where I was battling a Big Daddy and only had a wrench to fight him with when all my ammo was exhausted.  Being a few hours into the game, I didn't want to go back and never played it again.

I gave it another chance with the Bioshock Collection.  Knowing how the first one played, I was stingy with my ammo and my magic, and that was sufficient in order to get me through the game, but this is my first criticism of the game.  Imagine you are watching a movie and the main character spends ten minutes in each scene searching through drawers.  It would mess with the flow of the movie, and in the same way for me, it messes with the flow of the game.

That's why I like straight shooters.  You fight your way through a scene, pick up all the ammo that you need and you move on.  It's fun and not work.  Bioshock 2 was especially stingy on the ammo.  I would finally kill a Big Daddy and use up all my ammo.  For some reason, suddenly enemies would respawn, and I'd have to kill them too.  It wouldn't be such a big deal except for the fact that I'd use 200 bullets and collect 20.  It was a losing proposition which made me scrounge for large parts of the game.  Bioshock 2 also had the pleasant experience of sending Big Sisters your way when there was virtually no ammo left in the level.

I will say, in some ways, this made me use all of the weapons in the game, like the turrets and hacking the cameras, but there were several times in Bioshock 2 when I wondered if I would be able to move on.  The abundance of weapons is okay, but it can be a bit annoying to constantly have to switch, especially during battle.  Sometimes, because of low ammo, I had to go to almost every weapon to finish a battle.

With that being said, they had a cool concept.  The underwater environment and the 1920's theme were interesting.  I would laugh when the characters in Bioshock 2 would speak in 1940's Hollywood style and say, ""Why you ruffian, I should give you a good thrashing.""  The storyline in Bioshock 2 was a little weak, but it was your standard video game plot. (Get some stern warnings from the bad guy throughout the game, and at the end finally face them down).

Both Bioshock 1 and 2 were very difficult to begin the game, and then got almost too easy toward the end.  In Bioshock 2, I didn't even use hardly any of my plasmids.  I just had electricity 1, telekinesis 1, and leveled up my fire.

Bioshock Infinite - I'm currently in the middle of playing.  At first I thought I'd like it more.  It definitely has nicer graphics and I really enjoyed the carnival at the beginning of the game, where they teach you game concepts in the form of carnival games.  The environments are really nice.  The gameplay and story, however are a bit confusing.  Whereas Bioshock 1 & 2 were super difficult, this one is almost a walk through the park.  It's pretty easy to gun your way through a level, and if you die, there's really no penalty, as you will keep respawining while you enemies keep the same damage.  The female character that follows you around reminds me of Fable or some sort of Disney movie.  It seems like a very different game.  Also, I have the strange, uneasy sense of not knowing what the heck is going on half of the time.  I'm just kind of going from level to level, with half bits of half-baked story lines, and I have a feel for what is going on, but feel disconnected from the game in a way too.

With that being said, for the price you get three decent games, the updated graphics look good, and it will give you several hours of gaming time.  Bioshock 1 &2 will make you search every last corner of the game in order to get through it, while Infinite can be played through in a hurry.  For me, there are some major detractions to all of these games, but there are some enjoyable and challenging bright spots to them too.  If you like more a traditional shooter, you might not like all the resource gathering, but if you're familiar with RPG's that make you work, then you should be okay.",think origin began play bioshock sever year ago wasnt level enough didnt enough ammo rememb reach point battl big daddi wrench fight ammo exhaust hour game didnt want go back never play gave anoth chanc bioshock collect know first one play stingi ammo magic suffici order get game first critic game imagin watch movi main charact spend ten minut scene search drawer would mess flow movi way mess flow game that like straight shooter fight way scene pick ammo need move fun work bioshock 2 especi stingi ammo would final kill big daddi use ammo reason suddenli enemi would respawn id kill wouldnt big deal except fact id use 200 bullet collect 20 lose proposit made scroung larg part game bioshock 2 also pleasant experi send big sister way virtual ammo left level say way made use weapon game like turret hack camera,1533427200,4

But when charging it appears the device automatically turns on, and you have to press the power button when you stop charging or it remains on.

59118,2167,3431,"I really liked Human Revolution so I decided to try this game. Yes, we are probably headed toward a dystopian police state where we swim in our own garbage, but I don't play video games to immerse myself in that future of narrow garbage strewn passages and police abuse. Gone are the expansive vistas and beautiful buildings. Trashed apartments and people sleeping on the street are the norm and police checkpoints a constant annoyance. At least the destroyed cities in Fallout sported a rooftop lawn chair or two. I guess I'll finish this but I don't have much interest in the people I'm working for either.

The story is rather hazy and disjointed. You are working for a government group against a group deemed terrorist for opposing the police tactics you learned to hate in the first 5 minutes of the game. There are not nearly as many stealth opportunities as the whole game is on a very small format physically. Many of your explorations dead end in rooms that waste your time.

Yes, they emulate the games perfectly, but you don't get to play them all the way through.  You're presented with many original NES games to start out with, but they're individual challenges.  You might get a whole stage of a game, but that's it.  And it's not bad, either - each game has a lot of different challenges, like ""pop so many balloons"" or ""jump to the flagpole"" - different tasks in classic NES games, and you get to unlock new games and new challenges.

It's brilliant, really.  When you play these challenges, you unlock various mash-ups with the classics, like playing as Link in Donkey Kong without the ability to jump.  That one kind of perturbed me, but it was still a trip to play, and there are so many others.

59175,832,4482,"If I could get this 3.5 stars that's what I'd give it.  I'll go over what's bad before moving onto the good.

As with most Piranha Bytes games this is a poor man's open world RPG.  It lacks polish.  The graphics are passable.  Some of the textures and effects look really nice, but the characters' faces, especially their eyebrows, look closer to early ps3 level quality.  At times the translation to English is horrible and at other times it's perfect.

Quality control was lacking, at times I wondered how it passed PS4 certification.  For example, when using the world map the cursor would at times become magnetized to a certain character or place and you'd be unable to move it off of that spot, which made teleporting to fast travel points impossible without restarting the game.  Or when moving near the edge of the map the cursor would bog down making it impossible to choose a spot near the map's edge.

Enemy A.I. would at times be terrific with enemies seeking higher ground or a better angle by which to hit you with projectiles.  But that was countered by companion AI which is laughably bad.  Often my companion would have a clear line of sight to an enemy but wouldn't shoot their ranged weapon at all.  Or in a melee fight they'd simply stand there observing while the enemy took me to task instead of jumping in to help.  Sometimes they were more burdensome than helpful when they'd get in the way of your evasive roll causing you to get hit or killed, but overall it was nice to have them there mostly as a decoy for the enemy to attack.

Performance is not good, especially given how mediocre the graphics are.  At times when it was raining, which is quite often in the western part of the map, the frame rate would bog down to almost unplayable rates especially in larger areas with multiple enemies on screen.  When trying to access the menu the game freezes.  At one point I counted 15 seconds from the time I pressed the menu button until the time it finally opened.  This problem seemed to get worse the longer you played, restarting the game would reduce that wait time to about 2 seconds and then it would gradually get worse again the longer you played without a restart.

Perhaps the single most frustrating part of the game was the incredibly steep difficulty in the game's early stages.  It was probably around the 8-10 hour mark before I even obtained the ability to craft.  I'm sure it could be done faster if you knew exactly where to go and how to level up.  Even the weakest enemies could kill you in 2 or 3 hits and they themselves would require 10-15 hits to kill.  Combine that with a very clunky combat system and it's a recipe for frustration for the first 1/3 of the game.  Many times just in order to survive I had to cheese an enemy by having my companion whittle down their health bar with ranged attacks from a safe distance but even that proved frustrating as the companion often wouldn't attack, or the enemy would one-shot kill you with a ranged attack of their own, sending you back to your last save point after having whittle down their health bar for several minutes.

Many of the game's ""cities"" look nice but are large and very samey looking making them hard to navigate.  Some specific icons on the minimap to point you in the direction of stores and trainers would have alleviated this problem but they don't exist, leaving you to navigate the city somewhat blindly and force you to memorize the locations of the key areas of interest, or pull up the big map, but that leaves you stuck waiting for the very lengthy wait time for the menu to pull up.

After spending a couple of dozen hours in the game I had obtained a pretty lengthy list of notes and letters. Unfortunately there is no way to sort by unread messages or new items, so you'd have to scroll through a very long list of old notes just to read the new one you picked up.

If that sounds like a long list of negatives it is, and yet I still recommend the game.  Call me a sucker for open world RPGs but I can't get enough of them.  Let's move on to what the game did right.

The story and setting is one of the more interesting in gaming.  A comet struck the planet wiping out most of the population but leaving a resource called Elex.  The surviving civilization broke into a few different factions after the event.  The Berserkers refuse and condemn technology, saying that technology is essentially the root of all evil.  They do use magic however.  The Outlaws have no creed other than profit.  The Clerics are technologically advanced and worship a god known as Calaan who guides their decisions.  The Albs are the proverbial bad guys of the game and seem intent on collecting all of the Elex they can find at the command of their leader known as The Hybrid.  The Albs are humans who have had their emotions suppressed by their addiction to consuming Elex, essentially making them into slaves to The Hybrid.  The Separatists are former Albs who have found a way to break free from their Elex addiction and re-discover their emotions.

The way these factions interact with each other and your decisions to help or hurt them, join them or remain a free agent, is well done, especially at the end of the game.  Choosing to join a faction will open up certain perks otherwise unobtainable.  For example The Berserkers use magic, Outlaws use chems (drugs) and the Clerics specialize in technology.  Faction-specific skill trees are only obtainable after joining a faction, and joining a faction is an irreversible decision although you can still cooperate with other factions in many regards.

Some of the more interesting bits of story were found through notes.  (Minor spoiler coming) For example I came across the dilapidated shell of a couple's home and found a pre-comet diary entry from the wife where she wondered if her marriage was falling apart and if they even loved each other anymore.  She then went on to say how she read something about the possibility of a comet spelling the doom of mankind.  After setting down the note I noticed two skeletons in the living room embracing each other in a hug.  I suppose they remembered why they loved each other all along when the comet came bearing down on them.  These kinds of little nuggets were scattered throughout the world and were always interesting to find.

It seems as though Elex was going for something of a fantasy and sci-fi feel and for the most part it works.  You may encounter giant trolls, dinosaurs and more, but you'll also encounter large combat mechs.  The dissonance would be jarring but it works given the explanation of the setting and allows for a larger diversity of enemies.

Exploration is fantastic.  There are goodies to be found all over and you can obtain sunglasses which will highlight the items even through walls.  The jetpack you get early in the game makes exploration a breeze and is fun to use.

Observation is often times rewarded.  For example many locations will have a safe, and if you poke around for a few minutes you can usually find the combination.  If not, the game does offer the ability to hack the safe if you invest points in those skills.

After finally leveling up some and obtaining some better weapons combat became much more enjoyable.  The way the story came to an end while also opening the possibility for a sequel was well done and I'm interested in the sequel for sure.

In short, I enjoyed the game after the initial difficulty hurdle was behind me.  If you don't have much patience for low polish games you may not like Elex.  If you're a sucker for open-world RPGs, exploration and love a good apocalyptic dystopian tale then you may be able to look past the game's design warts and find that hidden gem inside.",could get 35 star that id give ill go what bad move onto good piranha byte game poor man open world rpg lack polish graphic passabl textur effect look realli nice charact face especi eyebrow look closer earli ps3 level qualiti time translat english horribl time perfect qualiti control lack time wonder pas ps4 certif exampl use world map cursor would time becom magnet certain charact place youd unabl move spot made teleport fast travel point imposs without restart game move near edg map cursor would bog make imposs choos spot near map edg enemi ai would time terrif enemi seek higher ground better angl hit projectil counter companion ai laughabl bad often companion would clear line sight enemi wouldnt shoot rang weapon mele fight theyd simpli stand observ enemi took task instead jump help sometim burdensom help theyd get way evas roll caus get hit kill overal nice mostli decoy enemi attack perform good especi given mediocr graphic time rain,1534204800,4

If you've been using a PS4 headset and then switch over to these the audio quality is noticeable but for the price they're being sold at its understandable so no complains here.

I don't have to worry about annoying my friends anymore when having the TV across the room from me (volume is kept around 14 or so). So far I've used them 8 hours straight and its surprisingly comfortable since its over the ears it doesn't tire me out. One thing I do wish is that it was a tad bit lighter, but other than that its an amazing headset. I'll be updating as I go along. Hopefully the joints on this will be long lasting which is a problem in most headsets.

59238,76,4509,"Kratos destroyed Greek Mythology and now he's moving on to Norse Mythology.  Baldur, Freia, Odin, the World Tree, and the World Serpent are all here.  The game begins with Kratos burning his wife's body and fulfilling her last request.  Take her ashes to the tallest peak.  Kratos and his son embark on a grand adventure to fulfill this wish.

Concept 9/10
This is a very immersive third person over the shoulder melee action game with adventure elements.  No load screens here...  The combat is visceral, the environments are beautiful, and the story is touching.

Story 10/10
Throughout the quest, Kratos orders his son around, but begins to learn what it means to be a father.  Atreus, earns Kratos's respect through translating the Norse Runes and fighting like a badass.  Kratos's pragmatic and brutal stoicism are joined by Atreus's sense of wonder and accomplishment.  Later, the duo is joined by a very wise man who teaches them about Norse Lore.  They explore the harsh Norse lands and fight giants, trolls, undead, and many other things.  But this is mostly a story about a father and son bonding while on a quest

Gameplay 10/10
Kratos has fire weapons, ice weapons, and stun weapons.  The enemies are resistant or vulnerable to each of these.  So, as you are playing, you'll be making quick tactical decisions on which weapons to use and reacting to the enemy attacks.  There is a large variety of enemies in this game, too.  The camera is very close / over the shoulder, so it puts you right into the action.  Unfortunately, many enemies can attack offscreen.  There are HUD markers which warn you about the incoming attacks so you do have time to block or dodge.
You've got long range attacks, close range combos, block, evade, and parry.  Atreus is pretty invincible so you don't have to worry about him.  He's got magic, some melee, and elemental ranged attacks with his bow.  He'll fight on his own, but you can command him to use his magically charged arrows with the square button, or unleash a magic attack by holding the square button.

There are simple puzzles as well.

Graphics 10/10
The levels are laid out to maximize the graphic capabilities of the PS4.  Theyre beautiful as well as the characters themselves.  This is the best looking PS4 game.

Sound 9/10
The music is engaging and immersive and the battle SFX put you into the action.  The characters are also very well acted.  The only thing thats missing is a solid theme song like the original God of War.

Value 9/10
The main campaign is about 20-30 hours long depending on how much you explore or how many side quests you do.  There is a New Game+ feature, but there isn't much replay value after you have finished the game.  There are optional quests and hidden super boss fights, but that is about it.  This is a game that you savor and enjoy once.  Maybe youll play it again a few years down the line.

Maturity M
There is brutal fantasy violence against monsters and swearing from a foul mouthed dwarf.  There isn't any nudity in the game, so if you can handle the F word, you should be OK.

Overall 10/10
This is a great addition to the prestigious God of War Saga.  Although Kratos feels a bit out of place in Norse Mythology, its still a great adventure.  The story is well told and engaging with great characters.  The action is what youd expect from God of War.  The graphics are incredible.

If you like the combat of God of War, youll love this game.
If you like the storytelling of The Last of Us, youll love this game.
If you like great graphics, youll love this game.
If you want a totally open world and everything fast paced, you may be annoyed.

If you liked God of War, check out Senuas Sacrifice.  Its got combat, puzzles, and a great story as well.

59248,9043,4509,"Well im a huge fan of the GoW series but as usual they had to stray from a winning formula. OK so instead of giving us the action/adventure masterpiece we're used to they had to try and put some role playing and some different combat mechanics in. They try to make the combat feel more like a DS game but the problem is they suck at it. The enemies movements are SO sloppy that it just doesn't work well at all (this is playing the second level from hardest). What really makes you scratch your head is they obviously knew the combat was sloppy, why you ask? Because they had to use visual ques just to make it work at all (yellow or red flahes). Want another example? Later in the game you fight a valkyrie and she has some moves that are instant pain if you miss step, ok cool but the game is so sloppy the the audio ques are useless.

This title also has a lot of different activities to learn, along with their control schemes, but it feels more like learning than playing.

There are some cool touches like checking out a territory with an owl's eye view or taming a beast and setting him loose on your enemies, but so far the missions haven't been very compelling, and the game seems to lack a singular and memorable enemy like the cult leader in FC5.

59266,2319,4250,"I want to thank all the reviewers who talked about the game and recommended it because for the longest time I thought this was a cheaply made first person parkour runner type game. I was way wrong in thinking that and if it wasent for you guys I would have never bought this.

While looking for ps4 exclusives to play (since everything I have is on steam nowadays) I kept seeing this pop up  on my amazon recommendations and decided to read why people were so hyped about it. I purchased the first game remaster on the recent psn sale for $10 (to my knowledge the physical copy isn't available in the US and is overpriced import..) and fell in love with it even for a vita game so buying this ps4 designed game was a no brainer.

This exponentially raises the bar on everything that made the first game great. Sure online aspects have shut down but they don't deter from the gameplay and enjoying the world and interactions of everything. Kats random voice sounds are adorable in each conversation, its not too ""family friendly"" but not too over the top violence. Its like watching a wholesome anime with good action/plot moments. Half of the time I am flying around just collecting random crystals and actually go out of my way to do sidequests and challenges as they come up just to get the full experience. The graphics, lighting, models, are really well done and everything is extremely fluid even when shifting gravity around and whipping through the air. Heres to hoping ps5 comes out soon so they can make a third one since developers said they would only make it on ps5/better hardware console :(. Really something to look forward to and definitly a game people should experience.

Current setup:
Original ps4 connected to 4k 43"" roku tv with hdr (yes the tv does clean up the 1080p signal to look better even tho its not ps4pro)

Personally I found the best way to savor this is to play in sessions in the evening before bed. so you can just relax and indulge in the gameplay.

59269,5041,3782,"Update:

the seller got back to me offering me a refund or another headset for free. I don't want to deal with a return. It's too much work where I live when I can pinch it or jiggle a chord to fix it. I also am not comfortable taking anything without returning the original. The first pair I had I had no problems with and the only difference was color.

The only reason I had to replace the first pair is because where they plug in on the PS4 remote it causes a lot of bending at the cord. I reinforced this pair at the plug with electrical tape so it wouldn't happen again.

I don't change ratings when sellers contact me. This is the first time. This seller didn't seem shady. They asked if I wanted a replacement or my money back. They did not ask me to change my review.

Original:

This is the 2nd set I've bought. I liked the 1st set. The only problem was the PS4 controller. It hooked in on the bottom and the angle caused the wiring to pull apart. I can't blame the headset for that.

This pair was buggy from the beginning. The volume key was messed up somehow. I'd only get audio in the left ear unless I messed with the wiring that sits by the volume piece. I can't blame the PS4 remote for this since it started immediately.  I'd have to hit or pinch the piece to get sound in the right ear. If I shift a little the sound in that ear will cut out again. It's annoying.

I don't know if I should caution people about this or not. The 1st pair was great. Maybe I got a bad headset. Maybe I got lucky the first time. The ratings make me think I just got unlucky so I'm assuming this is the most probable scenario.",updat seller got back offer refund anoth headset free dont want deal return much work live pinch jiggl chord fix also comfort take anyth without return origin first pair problem differ color reason replac first pair plug ps4 remot caus lot bend cord reinforc pair plug electr tape wouldnt happen dont chang rate seller contact first time seller didnt seem shadi ask want replac money back ask chang review origin 2nd set ive bought like 1st set problem ps4 control hook bottom angl caus wire pull apart cant blame headset pair buggi begin volum key mess somehow id get audio left ear unless mess wire sit volum piec cant blame ps4 remot sinc start immedi id hit pinch piec get sound right ear shift littl sound ear cut annoy dont know caution peopl 1st pair great mayb got bad headset mayb got lucki first,1535587200,4
59270,870,4252,"This review is for the MK.2 SE RGB version.

First off - at the moment, I can't find any version of iCUE (their software to customize the keyboard lighting) for the Mac.  If you want to use this on a Mac but have access to a Windows machine, one great thing is that you can save three profiles to the onboard memory of the keyboard.  That's awesome, IMO.  You can set up the lights the way that you want them, then transfer it over to your Mac to use it.  If you don't have access to a Windows machine, then...you're stuck with the default lighting that looks cool but is distracting to me.  I mention Macs because (a) I use a Mac and (b) this keyboard looks a lot like a Mac keyboard with the aluminum top plate and white keys, so I think it would appeal to Mac users.

This is my first keyboard with Cherry MX Speed switches.  I've used Red, Black, Brown, and Blue before.  My favorite has got to be Red, but that's all personal preference - my older brother loves Blue (which are much louder and tactile).  If you've never used a mechanical keyboard and don't have a place locally to go check them out, you may want to get a switch tester (I bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WASD-6-Key-Cherry-MX-Switch-Tester/dp/B00AZQKCD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WASD 6-Key Cherry MX Switch Tester</a>&nbsp;that really helped me understand the different kinds).

The quality of this keyboard is high, and it's got some fantastic features.  The keys themselves feel great to type on, and I like these Speed switches pretty much the same as Red switches...and I love Red switches.  The lighting is also very, very well done.  The aluminum top plate looks great, but it sounds like plastic (to me) when I tap on it because it sits on top of a plastic base.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as I have a couple of Logitech keyboards with aluminum bases that ""ring"" when I type on them...and I hate that, so I don't use them.  This keyboard pretty much only has the sound of the keys.

Speaking of which, the space bar is louder than I'm used to.  The main keys are a bit louder (I think), but not by much, than my SteelSeries keyboard with Red switches (which is an utterly amazing keyboard).  The space bar definitely makes more noise, at least with the way that I type and the amount of pressure that I put on it.  Absolutely not a deal breaker, given how great the rest of the keyboard is.

Back to features - the roller bar for the volume (at the upper right corner of the keyboard next to the media control buttons) is one awesome feature.  It feels very cool to use, and it works great on both my Mac and my Windows machines.  The brightness of the lighting is very easy to adjust with a single button, and there's another button to cycle through the three saved profiles.

One thing that I don't love is the cord - it's darn big.  It's a high quality cord, for sure, but it's large and comes out the top center of the keyboard.  There's no option to route it out one of the sides for easier concealment (like on my SteelSeries keyboard), and it's not easy to route in the first place because of the size.  It also has two large USB connectors on the end - one to connect the keyboard, and the other for a USB pass-through.

A took away a star for the lack of Mac software (at least that I could find), the kind of loud space bar, and the large cord.  That said, this really is a great keyboard.  I doubt that it replaces my SteelSeries board, but it's a close second.",review mk2 se rgb version first moment cant find version icu softwar custom keyboard light mac want use mac access window machin one great thing save three profil onboard memori keyboard that awesom imo set light way want transfer mac use dont access window machin thenyour stuck default light look cool distract mention mac use mac b keyboard look lot like mac keyboard aluminum top plate white key think would appeal mac user first keyboard cherri mx speed switch ive use red black brown blue favorit got red that person prefer older brother love blue much louder tactil youv never use mechan keyboard dont place local go check may want get switch tester bought anbspa datahookproductlinklink classalinknorm hrefwasd6keycherrymxswitchtesterdpb00azqkcd4refcmcrarpdrvwtxtieutf8wasd 6key cherri mx switch testeranbspthat realli help understand differ kind qualiti keyboard high got fantast featur key feel great type like speed switch pretti much red switchesand love red switch light also well done aluminum top plate look great sound like plastic tap,1535673600,4

59294,256,4517,"Best Spider-man game to date in terms of story and gameplay

--Story:
Peter Parker has been Spider-man for 8 years already, so no origin story with the radioactive spider or Uncle Ben's death (although mentioned briefly in the story).

There's a nice mix of a dual lifestyle in this game as the story balance out Peter Parker's personal life with that of Spider-man; making the character you play more relatable and to switch things up so you don't get constant combat making for good pacing.

Plot (minor spoilers, first few hours): Spider-man finally takes down the Kingpin and put him in jail. As a result, a new villain arises in the form of Mister Negative. Mister Negative or Martin Li also runs F.E.A.S.T. shelters across the city, which Peter's Aunt May works for which complicates things.

Aside from the Mister Negative; you face other villains in Spider-man's rogue gallery like Shocker, Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, Dr. Octopus, Vulture, Taskmaster and more. These characters don't play a huge part in the story compared to Mister Negative (and maybe one more villain), but the boss battles they're in are really fun.

Other villains are mentioned (but not able to face against) through phone conversations, collectables, and JJJ podcasts. Guess they want to save it for potential sequel.

There is DLC announced for the Black Cat as of this review with two more to come after.

--Gamplay:

A mix of Spider-man 2 and Batman Arkham games with it's own identity mixed in.

Web-slinging feel very natural once you get the hang of it, and way better than the Spider-man 2 game as you can more manual control. You have to time your button presses to shoot out webs, calculate airtime, forward thrust and momentum. It controls are very seamless once you get used to it.

Combat is very fast paced. Very similar to the Batman Arkham games with it's attack, dodge (when you get spider sense) mechanic, but more room to maneuver around compared to batman due to Spider-man having more agility, speed and ability to web swing.

-Options for combat are:
Melee Attacks

Web based attacks

Dodge

Web Gadgets: use of elemental webbing and/or web bombs/traps. Some of which are super effective against certain enemies

Swing Around- can be used as hit-and-run tactic if you're not high enough level

Grab nearby objects with web and toss at enemies

Activate focus meter/Activate Suit Powers - heal or do finishing move

There's a lot of combinations you can do, especially as you upgrade abilities. Combat is very fast, responsive and will not overwhelm you with options as these abilities will unlock gradually as you progress. It's also not a button masher as some abilities require you to time button presses or hold buttons for few seconds during combos.

-Upgrade System
There are 2 ways to upgrade Spider-man: leveling up and crafting items.

There are 3 upgrade trees you can select from:
Innovator: tactical skills
Defender: Melee combat based
Web-sling: Jump around/dodge better during combat, also can use in overworld/chase sequence mini-games

-Crafting.
You can upgrade your suit and make gadgets by collecting in-game tokens by doing side objectives

-There are 27 suits to collect. To unlock suits to craft, you have to be a certain level (and have materials) or complete certain objectives. If you 100% all side objectives you get this half naked spider-man suit where he's just in his underwear and a Spider-man mask. Last level unlock suit is at level 50.

If you pre-order the game; the Spiderpunk suit, for example is unlocked from the get-go instead of having to wait till you reach level 16.

There are 3 empty spaces for 3 additional suits. I assume it'll be included in the 3 planned story DLC for the game.

-Other Gameplay
To change up the pace a bit; you also play as Mary Jane, where you have to sneak around enemies to escape certain areas.

There's also QTE (quick time events) during cinematic sequences

Taskmaster acts like the Riddler in the Batman Arkham games giving you various side quests around the map before you face him

Game takes around 15-20 hours to complete depending on your skill and how fast you intend to rush through the main story campaign. To collect everything and get platinum trophy it can take upwards to 40 hours.

--Graphics
Game looks very good, especially on the PS4 Pro where Spider-man's suit and puddles stand out more compared to the regular PS4. Whatever format you play it on, the game looks amazing.

Has very good draw distance, and cinematic cutscenes. If you are nitpicky and walk up to individualized objects, the textures may be off a bit. Seeing the fast paced nature of the game, you most likely not have time to look around the over world anyway. Regardless, one of the best looking PS4 games to date

Voice acting is also very good. Like the banter between Peter and Mary Jane. Also get some fun laughs when you use the Quips (tell jokes to enemies) ability for the Comic Spider-man suit.

Overall, had a blast playing this game. If you're a fan of Spider-man or super hero games in general; it's a must buy.",best spiderman game date term stori gameplay stori peter parker spiderman 8 year alreadi origin stori radioact spider uncl ben death although mention briefli stori there nice mix dual lifestyl game stori balanc peter parker person life spiderman make charact play relat switch thing dont get constant combat make good pace plot minor spoiler first hour spiderman final take kingpin put jail result new villain aris form mister neg mister neg martin li also run feast shelter across citi peter aunt may work complic thing asid mister neg face villain spiderman rogu galleri like shocker electro rhino scorpion dr octopu vultur taskmast charact dont play huge part stori compar mister neg mayb one villain bos battl theyr realli fun villain mention abl face phone convers collect jjj podcast guess want save potenti sequel dlc announc black cat review two come gamplay mix spiderman 2 batman arkham game ident mix websling feel natur get hang way better spiderman 2 game manual control time button press shoot web calcul airtim forward thrust momentum control seamless get use,1536278400,5

59298,906,4517,"Having all of the main open world Spider-Man games, Spider-Man 2 PS2, Spider-Man 3 PS3, Amazing Spider-Man 1 PS3, Amazing Spider-Man 2 PS4, and now Spider-Man 2018 PS4, I can say a lot of of this game is built on those prior games' foundations; Treyarch for SM2 PS2 and Beenox for Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. With that said, Insomniac did a very nice job with the controls and open city of Manhattan. Built up from prior games, this is a great representation of the Spider-Man franchise.

Walking through the streets right away (since the game lets you freely explore within a certain range on the very first control session tutorial, this is definitely the most accurate version of NYC I've seen in a game so far. True Crime NYC was good for PS2, but this is much more detailed and impressive, though not as large as that other open world's map, which attempted to recreate most of the streets accurately in terms of length.

The details of this city are impressive, and I'm looking forward to exploring the rest of the map once I open it up.

As far as the Statue of Liberty in prior games, you could get there via helicopters over the water, which was neat in the old game. In the past, you could also reach part of a small island town via a bridge.
In the past Amazing Spider-Man games, you could jump onto helicopters but they didn't take you to the Statue and if you tried to cross the bridge, it would have you go back.

You can swim in this game, cool! I jumped in the water and instead of hopping out, Spidey was able to swim upright where he wanted within a limited range. Still very cool to see this added.
The on foot walking is smooth and nicely done. Swinging from building to building is smooth too, and nicely refined for the most part, even though it appears you can't individually control which are shoots the web line, which was awesome in a prior game. I still have more to unlock, so I'll see.

I'm not a big fan of the initial web line yet, which it seems you have to aim or jump first, before a line can be thrown up at a building. I have more to learn but it's different compared to prior games where you just press the swing button and it automatically connects to the nearest building with no other buttons needed.

The city from above is most impressive, and really captures the view from the Empire state building well. The distant surround cities and NJ look great in the distance also.

Overall, I'm definitely enjoying this game's fine polish and refinement in controls, game play, missions and exploration of an open world city.

The only wish list I have is being able to walk around free roam of NYC as regular plain clothes Peter Parker in the open map of the city, unless that's to be discovered as I play more.",main open world spiderman game spiderman 2 ps2 spiderman 3 ps3 amaz spiderman 1 ps3 amaz spiderman 2 ps4 spiderman 2018 ps4 say lot game built prior game foundat treyarch sm2 ps2 beenox amaz spiderman 1 2 said insomniac nice job control open citi manhattan built prior game great represent spiderman franchis walk street right away sinc game let freeli explor within certain rang first control session tutori definit accur version nyc ive seen game far true crime nyc good ps2 much detail impress though larg open world map attempt recreat street accur term length detail citi impress im look forward explor rest map open far statu liberti prior game could get via helicopt water neat old game past could also reach part small island town via bridg past amaz spiderman game could jump onto helicopt didnt take statu tri cross bridg would go back swim game cool jump water instead hop spidey abl swim upright want within limit rang still cool see ad,1536278400,5

59305,1275,4517,"Let me start off by saying I don't really care much about spiderman, in fact, I don't like superhero movie stuff in general.  I haven't seen Black Panther, or Infinity war because the genera doesn't appeal to me.

But I was intrigued to try out the web slinging in this game and I have to say that's worth the price of admission so far.  I love how the game immediately gets you out into the world slinging and playing an intense mission as spider man.  It seems the story will be really interesting too especially the whole dynamic of spider man verses Peter's normal boring life.

The world looks stunning, although there are some minor graphical glitches and I did accidently sling into a building and become trapped inside in a game ending glitch.  There are other minor things too, like spider man grabs onto air when is climbing towards an edge.  None of those things are a huge deal but maybe wait a couple weeks for the game to patch up a little bit.

All in all, the game is incredibly fun so far and that's what counts.

One thing that I'd like to comment on is that this game has no graphical downgrade.  The puddles look amazing with incredibly reflections and dynamic range.  I think that's important because it all enhances the experience.  They just need to fix some of the glitches

59306,742,4517,"This is the game that is going to send this studio into the stratosphere. It's not totally perfect at launch, but Spider-Man in general is the best adaptation in game form that has ever been made for this hero. And that is an easy statement to make.

They take multiple open worlds to draw inspiration from, and deftly steal a bit out of Rocksteady's Batman series, but they do so while improving the game and making it a joy to play. The open world design template is never going to satisfy everyone, but here it is presented with a fairly good side selection of content that may even seem more fun than it really is due to the amazing sense of movement with traversal. Collectibles are abundant but not overbearing, and I never felt like I needed to do certain things even on the harder difficulty.

This is Spider-Man, and at all times I finally felt like the character in-game. Swinging through Marvel's NYC is an amazing experience, and in that regard it's a bit like Infamous SS's Seattle but more detailed and with more things to do. The only thing better would be a full VR experience in 4K at this point because they really nailed the identity of their character for this game. I can only imagine the potential of this IP.

Right now, though, Insomniac has done everything possible to bring this game to the big leagues. At nearly every level they succeed. Combat is even more complex than the Arkham games, and on hard it is a challenge in many parts but always staying fair. The controls are fluid and exceptional when you get leveled up, and you always feel you are in control of the game without too much lag or animation getting in the way. This is a superbly animated game by the ways.

The story is coherent and worthwhile, the acting is not too bad and details of faces are top-tier. Overall the general level of quality in the narration is high, and the animation for faces is some of the best in gaming. That alone separates it from most super hero games, but it also brings the gameplay elements that it needs to succeed in a world only Insomniac artists could bring to life in this way.

The city they have crafted is just bonkers beautiful. On a PS4 Pro I have rarely seen better cities in total, though, a few sacrifices and problems I hope will get ironed out with a few patches. Nothing too concerning though. Crawling around apartments and looking inside has rarely been so fun, and the idea that you truly inhabit the city as Spider-Man is both convincing and true to the comics. Textural detail and LODs are impressive for a console with a weaker CPU. Animation again is top notch, while draw distances and detail everywhere is a step above most developers on console.

The sound and music is also a delight, and the overall package of SFX and immersion from audio is significantly better than anything Insomniac have done in the past. The image quality on a PS4 Pro is fantastic, and all in all this is a must buy. Nothing else needs to be said. Go out and get this game for yourself, your kids, and whoever else might want to play it.

This is set to be Insomniac's first ten million seller. And they deserve it. A triumph in every way.",game go send studio stratospher total perfect launch spiderman gener best adapt game form ever made hero easi statement make take multipl open world draw inspir deftli steal bit rocksteadi batman seri improv game make joy play open world design templat never go satisfi everyon present fairli good side select content may even seem fun realli due amaz sen movement travers collect abund overbear never felt like need certain thing even harder difficulti spiderman time final felt like charact ingam swing marvel nyc amaz experi regard bit like infam ss seattl detail thing thing better would full vr experi 4k point realli nail ident charact game imagin potenti ip right though insomniac done everyth possibl bring game big leagu nearli everi level succeed combat even complex arkham game hard challeng mani part alway stay fair control fluid except get level alway feel control game without much lag anim get,1536451200,5

59314,1194,4509,"An award for best graphics for the PS4 should immediately be given to God of War. I had to say that first.

Onward. Kratos is in Viking country, facing the gods of old, trying to raise his son Atreus, and dealing with the loss of his wife. All a stage for his rise to legend as he pounds, hacks, and kicks the living piss out of everything. Combat is smooth, easy to learn and so rewarding. Nothing feels as good as burying Kratos' axe in the head of a draugr or invoking his rage. Weapons, skills and runes can be upgraded, as well as armor, weapons and special abilities for his son. Easy.

The story rolls along nicely and sweetly. Kratos has a calling set forth by an upstart Viking god, so he storms up a mountain to hash it out. The violence of combat is interspersed with moments of silence and bitterness between him and his son. You explore a vast territory packed with menacing enemies (all delightfully different), gods, support characters, and bosses. The script is A-grade for a videogame. It's like watchign a well made movie.

But the graphics...Oh, man. Buckle up and let your jaw drop, hit the ground, fly up and drop again. Simply stunning. The developers ran wild with the colors, maps and textures. I took moments to drink it all in and was so impressed and happy that the developers put so much into this. It's a brilliant gem, polished and set high on a king's crown. (Ok, maybe I'm overselling it.)

59328,4142,4517,"So first the bad...

This game has BY FAR one of the most infuriating combat system I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing. It's a copy of the Batman Arkham games, but not nearly as refined. A typical fight will pit you against 10-20 enemies. Most have guns and rocket launchers, some are brutes, some are holding sticks and they're all attacking you relentlessly at the same time. The guns auto target you regardless of how fast you're moving, the brutes can ignore your punches and spam attack you to death and the guys with sticks can block all of your attacks somehow.  All physical attacks from enemies ""magnetize"" towards you unless you press the magic dodge button, while some enemies can auto block/dodge/deflect or simply ignore your attacks unless you engage with the right attack sequence. Meanwhile your punches and kicks are butterfly kisses on a silk curtain compared to theirs and it takes forever to down a single enemy.

Lending to this feeling of being a itsy bitsy weakling is the fact that your normal hits sound like someone throwing crumpled paper at a wall. They lack the ""POW!"" and ""BAM!"" that you get from say the Batman Arkham titles. Sorry but I was under the impression I was playing as Spider-Man, a guy who can bench press an Abrams tank and dodge bullets while telling a yo mama joke. Why is a guy dressed as a bat somehow stronger and more effective in a fight than freaking Spider-Man? Visually, Spider-man's hits look like they hurt more but it doesn't feel or sound that way. So all in all a rather lazy, illogical and unsatisfying combat system.

And now the good...

Literally everything else...well mostly.

The graphics are gorgeous, the characters are well acted and the story is comparable to the better Spider-Man movies. Swinging is fun but feels a little too slow and lacks the ability to climb your web to gain height a la Ultimate Spider-Man (my personal favorite SM game). Movement in general is great but Spider-Man's normal jump is too small and double-jump is sadly missing. The settings menu allows you to skip the mini puzzle games, deactivate quick-time events or change button prompts from button-mash to hold-down-button (THANK YOU). Missions are mostly fun but a few are just awful (looking at you pigeons). There are a whopping 27 skins to unlock, each with their own special ability. Unfortunately most of the abilities are terrible and can only be used for a limited time with a ridiculously long cool down. None are as fun as say the Unlimited suit from Spider-Man (PS1) that had a stealth mode (though it's hinted at for the future).

So in short the game is severely held back by a cheap, rage inducing combat system, but is otherwise great.",first bad game far one infuri combat system ive ever misfortun experienc copi batman arkham game nearli refin typic fight pit 1020 enemi gun rocket launcher brute hold stick theyr attack relentlessli time gun auto target regardless fast your move brute ignor punch spam attack death guy stick block attack somehow physic attack enemi magnet toward unless press magic dodg button enemi auto blockdodgedeflect simpli ignor attack unless engag right attack sequenc meanwhil punch kick butterfli kiss silk curtain compar take forev singl enemi lend feel itsi bitsi weakl fact normal hit sound like someon throw crumpl paper wall lack pow bam get say batman arkham titl sorri impress play spiderman guy bench press abram tank dodg bullet tell yo mama joke guy dress bat somehow stronger effect fight freak spiderman visual spiderman hit look like hurt doesnt feel sound way rather lazi illog unsatisfi combat system good liter everyth elsewel mostli graphic gorgeou charact well act stori,1536710400,4

59347,3773,1356,"I have lots of respect for Corsair, despite their keyboards going down hill lately. But their mice are something completely different. I appreciate how Corsair just goes in a completely different direction with their mice shapes, but also continues to deliver great performance and build quality.

The shape is very unique, not many mice use this general shape. Its short, but wide. However, from my experience this can suite all grip styles if your hand is the right size. The shape does take a while to get use to, but once you get use to it I think you would enjoy it.

The buttons are amazing. The left and right click buttons use Omron switches, and they feel great with this shell. Nice and tactile, while being light and quiet. The scroll wheel is one of the best I've used. It has noticeable steps but remains smooth and quiet. Scroll click is a little tight, but that's more than likely due to the high build quality. Left and right click are very tactile but a little mushy at the same time. The sniper button is tactile and tension-ed well, so no accidental hits to that button. Same goes for the DPI buttons.

The sensor is the Pixart PMW3360. I can confirm Corsair implemented this sensor very well, no angle snapping, skipping, jitter or acceleration.

59348,5853,4258,"Okay...that's not entirely accurate.  There is a non-VR mode, but this game was obviously made for VR.  I'd be pissed if I bought this game to play without a VR headset on.

That said, this game is downright TERRIFYING at times.  Not just the moments where things jump out at you, but also the times that you're waiting for things to jump out at you.  This is a survival horror game...surprise, surprise.  It seems half of the games for PSVR are survival horror games.  You run around and solve puzzles, try not to get killed by the bad guys, or, at times, try to kill the bad guys.  Sometimes you have to experiment a bit before you find out how to fight correctly, like a certain garage scene.

Like most survival horror games for PSVR, it's rather short.  That's okay for me, since I had to pace myself to finish.  I couldn't play for more than an hour or so at a time.  The suspense can be a bit nerve-racking.  I'm not usually scared easily by movies or video games, but I'm finding these VR games to be quite unsettling.  This isn't the best one I've played, but I did enjoy it a lot.  I think I'll play it again sometime in the future.

IF I WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE, DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE VR!

59349,8338,4517,"First and foremost, the taskmaster challenges. They open way too late in the game, and when you can finally access them, they're complete garbage. They're not challenging, or fun, they're just pointlessly frustrating; and a lot of the in-game content is locked behind them. That's my biggest complaint. I would also note that there aren't enough base tokens unless you clear the bases just so, which is also a pointless waste of time and effort, though the challenge tokens become a problem before the base tokens do. It's honestly BS that you can 100%  the game and still not have access to everything, due to contrived and pointless requirements which don't contribute to completion or to gameplay or to the story, and which seem to exist for the sole purpose of constraining the freedom of the player to play the game in the way that they see fit or otherwise enjoy. Which completely sucks.

The second problem is that the stealth, both when playing as Spidey and when playing as MJ or Miles, leaves a lot to be desired. It's impossible to fully stealth bases as Spidey, for instance, since the enemies automatically detect you at wave 2. This isn't game breaking, but is an annoyance for someone who likes to play it slow and smart, and would like the stealth aspects of the game to be more fleshed out.

Missions as MJ or Miles don't offer enough direction, making it too easy to mis-step, unnecessarily forcing the player to start over, and breaking the immersion.

Lastly, there are two bugs: there's a glitch in the animation when beginning a swing from a dive or rapid descent, that's not noticeable at first but gets annoying after you've played for a while (since it both slows you down and looks bad); and occasionally the game crashes when using suit powers.

Complaints aside, the game looks good and feels great, traversal is fun and fast, combat is adequate; Though there need to be more ways way to take down brutes, shield combatants and baton combatants; the dodge button often doesn't work; and there's occasionally no way to break out after getting boxed in, leading to an unnecessary death. I would also note that finishers are basically useless, since health depletes so quickly, and since the focus bar barely heals you at all, fills very slowly, and only holds 3 charges. Your only real option if you get depleted and are low on health (which can happen frequently since the dodge button doesn't work at least 35% of the time, and due to the health, healing and focus related issues I've already pointed out), is to swing around to build up focus (which build faster from swinging than from combat, for whatever reason), spamming the heal button while dodging bullets and rpgs and sometimes boss attacks until you're well enough to fight again; which, while not the worst thing in the world, doesn't really inspire much confidence in Spider-Man's competence in combat (or at the very least, in first aid), and makes finishers a risky luxury rather than a useful tool.

Flaws aside, I enjoyed the game, and am waiting, albeit impatiently, for NG+ mode and the upcoming DLC. Maybe then I can unlock all the suits...",first foremost taskmast challeng open way late game final access theyr complet garbag theyr challeng fun theyr pointlessli frustrat lot ingam content lock behind that biggest complaint would also note arent enough base token unless clear base also pointless wast time effort though challeng token becom problem base token honestli b 100 game still access everyth due contriv pointless requir dont contribut complet gameplay stori seem exist sole purpos constrain freedom player play game way see fit otherwis enjoy complet suck second problem stealth play spidey play mj mile leav lot desir imposs fulli stealth base spidey instanc sinc enemi automat detect wave 2 isnt game break annoy someon like play slow smart would like stealth aspect game flesh mission mj mile dont offer enough direct make easi misstep unnecessarili forc player start break immers lastli two bug there glitch anim begin swing dive rapid descent that notic first get annoy youv play sinc slow look bad,1537142400,3

59357,8626,4428,"On my desk, I have way too many input devices. To save space, this 84 key mechanical keyboard does the job.
Losing the space the numeric keypad takes up allows me to use other input devices on my desk without having to move them to different spots.

With Cherry MX keys, this is a solid keyboard. Although with mech you get more clickity clack, the feedback is excellent and I enjoy typing on this keyboard. But the noise.... is less than desired especially if you stream and have to do work arounds on the open mic.

Here are some things that I wish they would improve and why I gave it 3 stars. I am being very critical here because this is not a cheap keyboard.

- This should be wireless.
- Needs to be quieter. For people who stream and game near an open mic, this can be improved on the hardware end.
- Price is too high. This is no more than a $80 keyboard. With less keys and plastic material being used it should cost less.
- Have more ergonomic tilt angles to work with. All keyboard manufacturers screw up on this part by not allowing different angle positions on the footer stops. There should be at least 4 heights with 2 degrees of variations.
- Cable takes up two USB ports. Its really a waste if one is not using the backside USB port for anything. Having a mouse connected to the back of the keyboard doesn't save anything. Its still wired and just adds more clutter with more of the mouse cable on the desk. More so, I imagine an USB input controller sitting inside the keyboard that queues up both keyboard and mouse input. Let the operating system decide who gets priority.
- iCue only allows up to 5 levels of lighting effects. This is really a problem for those who use applications (like games) that need to categorize lighting according to different game input categories. There is little point in owning a RGB keyboard if this is limited. If Corsair can do all sorts of library effeccts on 16 million RGB colors, whats the problem with having more than 5 static color overlays? Its static. If the problem is you can 't refresh fast enough then you got a design problem you need to address to fix your keyboard.

59366,8356,3409,"I have no complaints about the keyboard itself. I love how it types, and the keys are easy to press and sensitive. Solid for typing. I don't use it for much gaming, as I usually use a controller.

My issue is with the software that Corsair is supplying for the lighting. I also own the M65 PRO RGB Mouse and MM800 RGB Polaris mouse pad. All of these run under the Corsair software called iCue.

When I first got my keyboard/mouse/pad I was running an older version of this software when it was just called 'Cue'. The software would mess with my USB ports bad. It would lock up other USB devices (like my game controllers) and it would cause Steam to freeze/lock up. I stumbled on a Steam forum topic where others had the same issue, and it just so happened the Cue software was the issue. The fix was to either flip the firmware switch on the back of the keyboard all the way to the last spot, then back to the first spot, or unplug all the Corsair devices and plug them back in. Sometimes this wouldn't work, and a full system restart was the only thing that would fix it. It was an annoyance for sure.

Now, Corsair has rolled out the iCue version of the software. At first, it was a great upgrade and cut out the issue I had with it locking up USB ports. But now, it's randomly causing my entire system to do a hard freeze. At first I thought I was having RAM or Graphics card issues, but I know now that is not the case. Every time my system freezes (ctrl+alt+delete doesn't even work), I have to unplug all 3 of the Corsair products I have from thier USB slots. It takes a few seconds, but eventually my system then becomes fully responsive and I can then plug back in the USB ports and everything is fine. Until the next random freeze happens.

I love the keyboard, the mouse is awesome, and the mouse pad looks sharp. But I am still ping ponging ticket updates with Corsair to try and find out what is causing this issue, but it is for sure in the iCue software. If I don't run the software, I never get a freeze.",complaint keyboard love type key easi press sensit solid type dont use much game usual use control issu softwar corsair suppli light also m65 pro rgb mous mm800 rgb polari mous pad run corsair softwar call icu first got keyboardmousepad run older version softwar call cue softwar would mess usb port bad would lock usb devic like game control would caus steam freezelock stumbl steam forum topic other issu happen cue softwar issu fix either flip firmwar switch back keyboard way last spot back first spot unplug corsair devic plug back sometim wouldnt work full system restart thing would fix annoy sure corsair roll icu version softwar first great upgrad cut issu lock usb port randomli caus entir system hard freez first thought ram graphic card issu know case everi time system freez ctrlaltdelet doesnt even work unplug 3 corsair product thier usb slot,1537833600,3

I do have decades of experience playing video games and I consider a 3 star rated game to be perfectly enjoyable despite having its downsides.  That being said, there are some serious problems that prevent this game from being a fun experience.  First of all, you have a stamina bar that you depend upon to execute attacks.  That's all well and good, but unlike say The Witcher 3, you cannot even dodge when your stamina is depleted.  Another review mentioned that you should focus on ranged weapons, but initially you only find a bow and a handful of arrows so you are forced to use melee at the beginning of the game.

My other primary complaint is that there are a few factions that you can join, but the first faction you encounter is some neo-Luddite group that eschews technology.  There's nothing wrong with that, but the in-game menu involves this device you wear on your wrist in order to access your inventory, map, etc.  If you use it in view of members of this faction, they warn you that it is against their laws.

Pros: + Stunning graphics (Manhattan in particular is just gorgeous).
  + Combat is a blast (perfectly captures the speed and resourcefulness with which Spiderman would fight).
  + Story is tremendous (quite frankly, one of the best stories ever for a PS4 video game).
  + Villains are brilliant (great mix of the old, tried and tested Spiderman villains that you know and love, along with
  some great new villains that you've never seen before).
  + Some of the best writing ever for a PS4 game (Peter Parker's trademark banter is alive and well during combat,
  providing some genuinely laugh out loud moments).
  + Webslinging through New York is a lot of fun.
  + Voice acting is tremendous (Peter Parker, J Jonah Jameson, and Otto Octavius in particular are standouts).

Cons: - With all the gadgets, skills, and suit powers that Spiderman acquires during the game, it is possible to become a little overpowered. I pretty much cruised through the normal level. You might want to try the most difficult level if you want a real challenge.
